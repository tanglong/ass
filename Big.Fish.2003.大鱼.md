	有些鱼是永远抓不到的\N
	There are some fish that cannot be caught.
	这不是因为它们游的快或者比其他鱼强壮\N
	It's not that they're faster or stronger than other fish.
	而是他们有些与众不同\N
	They're just touched by something extra.
	这条鱼叫野兽\N
	One such fish was The Beast.
	在我出生的那个时候他已经是个传奇人物了\N
	And by the time I was born he was already a legend.
	他在阿拉巴马使鱼饵落空的次数比其他鱼多100次\N
	He'd passed up more $ 100 lures than any fish in Alabama.
	有人说这条鱼...\N
	Some said that fish was the ghost of a thief...
	是那个60年前在这条湖里淹死的小偷的亡灵\N
	...who'd drowned in that river 60 years before.
	另外的人说他是白垩纪的恐龙\N
	Others claimed he was a dinosaur left over from the "Cruaceous" Period.
	我对这种假设或者迷信不屑一顾\N
	I didn't put any stock into such speculation or superstition.
	我曾经抓住过这条鱼...\N
	All I knew was I'd been trying to catch that fish...
	...在我还没你大的时候\N
	...since I was a boy no bigger than you.
	在你出生的那天....\N
	And on the day you were born...
	就是我抓住他的那天\N
	Well, that was the day I finally caught him.
	现在  我要尝试所有的方法:\N
	Now, I'd tried everything on it:
	虫子   诱饵   花生白脱   还有奶酪\N
	Worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut butter and cheese.
	但是在那天我得到了个启示:\N
	But on that day I had a revelation:
	如果那条鱼是亨利.华斯的灵魂\N
	If that fish was Henry Walls' ghost, 
	一般的诱饵是起不了作用的\N
	then the usual bait wasn't gonna work.
	我一定要用他最想得到的东西做诱饵\N
	I was gonna have to use something he truly desired.
	-你的手指? -黄金\N
	- Your finger? - Gold.
	现在   我把戒指系上了他们做的线...\N
	Now, I tied my ring onto the strongest line they made...
	...据他们说结实的在短短几分钟可以拉起一座桥\N
	...strong enough to hold up a bridge, they said, if only for a few minutes.
	然后我在上游投出了\N
	And then I cast upriver.
	那个怪物跳了起来  甚至还没等到接触水面就抓住了它\N
	The Beast jumped up and grabbed it before it even hit the water.
	然后非常迅速地折断了那条线\N
	And just as fast, he snapped clean through that line.
	你明白我的窘境了吧\N
	Well, you can see my predicament.
	我的结婚戒指   忠实於我妻子的标志...\N
	My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife...

	...soon to be mother of my child... - Make him stop.
	...现在已经在一条抓不到的鱼的肠子里了\N
	...was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
	你是怎么做的?\N
	What did you do?
	我从上游跟那个条鱼到下游\N
	I followed that fish upriver and downriver.
	那条鱼   那个怪物...\N
	This fish, The Beast...
	...我们一直称它为"他"   但是实际上应该是"她"\N
	...the whole time we were calling it a him, when in fact it was a her.
	它正怀着孩子  随时可能临产\N
	It was fat with eggs it was gonna lay any day.
	现在我就处在这种情况中\N
	Now, I was in a situation.
	我要割开那条鱼的肚子把我的结婚戒指取回来...\N
	I could gut that fish and get my wedding ring back...
	...但如果我这么做了\N
	...but in doing so I'd 
	就等於杀死了阿斯顿湖里最聪明的鱼\N
	be killing the smartest catfish in the Ashton River.
	我要剥夺...\N
	Did I want to deprive my son the chance...
	...我的子孙抓住这条鱼的机会吗?\N
	...to catch a fish like this of his own?
	我和那条鱼夫人....\N
	This ladyfish and I...
	-我们有着相同的使命 -"我们都是相同等式的一部分"\N
	- Well, we had the same destiny. - "We were part of the same equation."
	现在  你也许会问...\N
	Now, you may well ask...
	哦   亲爱的   亲爱的   这是你的夜晚\N
	Oh, darling, darling, it's still your night.
	...为什么对其他东西都无动於衷的它对金子下手那么快?\N
	...why did it strike so quick on gold when nothing else would attract it?
	那是从那天的事我学到的...\N
	That was the lesson I learned that day...
	...我儿子出生的那天\N
	...the day my son was born.
	有时抓住一个女人的心的唯一方法...\N
	Sometimes the only way to catch an uncatchable woman...
	...就是给她一个结婚戒指\N

	我打电话去的时候  \N
	And when I'd call, 
	她总是说父亲驾车出去了 或者是在游泳池里游泳\N

	就这样   我们再也没有说话\N
	True to form, we never talked about not talking.
	实际上   我没有在我父亲身上看到我\N
	The truth is, I didn't see anything of myself in my father.
	我相信他也没在我身上找到他的影子\N

	说起我父亲这一生的故事...\N

	Well, it's too small for a man of my ambition.
	你怎么说? 要不要和我一起走?\N
	So, what do you say? Join me?
	好的\N
	Okay.
	好的\N
	Okay.
	首先   我们要为去的城市做好准备\N
	Now, first, we gotta get you ready for the city.
	爱德华.布鲁   阿斯顿的长子...\N
	Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton...
	...怀着沉重的心情为你送行\N
	...it's with a heavy heart that we see you go.
	请带上城市钥匙...\N
	But take with you this key to the city...
	...你随时都能回来...\N
	...and know that any time you want to come back...
	...我们的大门为你敞开\N
	...all our doors are open to you.
	当我离开阿斯顿的那个下午   似乎所有人都有忠告\N
	That afternoon as I left Ashton, everyone seemed to have advice.
	给你自己找个好姑娘  要快!\N
	Find yourself a nice girl, now!
	别失去自尊   爱德华.布鲁!\N
	Watch your pride, Edward Bloom!
	但是有个人的忠告我最重视\N
	But there was one person whose counsel I held above all others.
	他说湖里的那条大鱼...\N
	She said that the biggest fish in the river...
	...从来没有被抓过\N
	...gets that way by never being caught.
	-她说了什么? -打我\N
	- What'd she say? - Beats me.
	离开阿斯顿有两条路:\N
	There were two roads out of Ashton:
	新的已经铺好了路面 旧的没有\N
	A new one which was paved and an older one that wasn't.
	大家都不走旧的那条...\N
	People didn't use the old one anymore...
	...传说那里闹鬼\N
	...and it had developed a reputation for being haunted.
	因为我不想再回阿斯顿了...\N
	Well, since I had no intention of ever returning to Ashton...
	... 看来这次是个好机会看看老路有什么\N
	...this seemed as good a time as any to find out what lay down that old one.
	-你知道谁走过吗? -那个诗人   诺什.温丝勒走过\N
	- You know anyone who's taken it? - That poet, Norther Winslow, did.
	他去了法国巴黎\N
	He was going to Paris, France.
	我猜他喜欢那里. 没人再有他的消息了\N
	I guess he liked it. No one ever heard from him again.
	我要告诉你. 你选另外条路\N
	I'll tell you what. You go the other way.
	我在这抄小路   在那头见\N
	I'll cut through here, and I'll meet you on the far side.
	你是想逃走  对吗?\N
	You're just trying to run away, aren't you?
	拿着\N
	Here.
	为了让你相信  你可以拿着我的包\N
	Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
	为什么   你这个狗娘--\N
	Why, you son of a...
	那就是说一个有理智的人...\N
	Now, there comes a point when a reasonable man...
	...在这时候会放下尊严  承认自己犯了个天大的错误\N
	...will swallow his pride and admit that he's made a terrible mistake.
	事实是  我从来就不是个有理智的人\N
	The truth is, I was never a reasonable man.
	我想起了才主日学校的事...\N
	And what I recall of Sunday school was that...
	...事情越艰难   到最后得到的回报越大\N
	...the more difficult something is, the more rewarding it is in the end.
	朋友! 欢迎你!\N
	Friend! Welcome to you!
	-你叫什么? -爱德华.布鲁.\N
	- What's your name? - Edward Bloom.
	-就像花那样"盛开" ? -对的\N
	- "Bloom" like a flower? - Yes.
	哦   这里! 你来啦  来这了 "爱德华.布鲁."\N
	Oh, here! Here you are, right here. "Edward Bloom."
	我们还没想到你会来\N
	We weren't expecting you yet.
	-你们想我? -还没\N
	- You were expecting me? - Not yet.
	你一定没有走捷径. \N
	You must've taken a shortcut. 
	为什么   我走了. 差点杀了我自己\N
	Why, yes, I did. It almost killed me.
	人生会给你这些教训. 事实上   长的路往往比较好走\N
	Life will do that to you. And truthfully, the long way is easier.
	-但是这也太长了. -长的多\N
	- But it's longer. - Much longer.
	现在你在这 这才是关键\N
	And you're here now, and that's what matters.
	这里是哪?\N
	What is this place?
	幽灵镇. 阿拉巴马最好的藏身之处!\N
	The town of Spectre. Best-kept secret in Alabama!
	这里说你是来自阿斯顿的  对吗?\N
	Now, it says here you're from Ashton, right?
	我们在阿斯顿遇见的最后一个人是诺什.温丝勒.\N
	Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
	那个诗人? 他怎么了?\N
	The poet? Whatever happened to him?
	他仍然在这. 我给你弄点喝的. 我把所有事都告诉你\N
	He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it.
	该死   我让他告诉你!\N
	Hell, I'll have him tell you!
	我要见些人   已经迟到了\N
	I have to meet somebody, and I'm already running late.
	孩子   我告诉你. 你来早了\N
	Now, son, I already told you. You're early.
	告诉我这是不是你吃过的最好吃的馅饼\N
	Now, tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
	确实是\N
	It truly is.
	这里什么都好. 水也很清甜\N
	Well, everything tastes better here. Even the water is sweet.
	不是太热  太冷   太潮湿\N
	Never gets too hot, too cold, too humid.
	在晚上   清风拂过树林...\N
	At night, the wind goes through the trees where you'd swear...
	...你就感觉是大型交响乐团为你演奏\N
	...there was a whole symphony out there playing just for you.
	嘿! 珍妮!\N
	Hey! Jenny!
	回来这里!\N
	Come back here!
	珍妮!\N
	Jenny!
	嘿   我要那些\N
	Hey, I need those.
	-没有比这镇上更松软的土地了 -就像首诗\N
	- There is no softer ground than town. - That almost rhymes.
	他是我们这最傑出的诗人. 来吧\N
	He's our poet laureate. Come on.
	我答应在这过个下午   只是想知道...\N
	I agreed to spend the afternoon, if only to understand...
	...为什么这里感觉这么陌生\N
	...the mystery of how a place could feel so strange and yet so familiar.
	这首诗我已经写了12年\N
	I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
	真的吗?\N
	Really?
	人们都很期望. 我不想辜负他们\N
	There's a lot of expectation. I don't wanna disappoint my fans.
	我可以吗?\N
	May I?
	只有三行\N
	It's only three lines long.
	这就是你不要把未成品给人看的原因\N
	This is why you should never show a work in progress.
	我抓住了!\N
	I got him!
	里面有水蛭\N
	There's leeches in there.
	-你看见那个女人了吗? -她看起来怎么样?\N
	- Did you see that woman? - What did she look like?
	-她是.... -裸体的?\N
	- Well, she was... - Was she naked?
	是的\N
	Yes, she was.
	不是女人.是鱼. 没有人抓住过她\N
	It's not a woman. It's a fish. No one ever catches her.
	每个人看到的鱼都不一样\N
	Fish looks different to different people.
	我爸爸说它们看上去就像他小时候养的猎犬...\N
	My daddy said it looked like the coon dog he had when he was a kid...
	...起死回生\N
	...back from the dead.
	哦   该死\N
	Oh, darn.
	-你几岁了? -18\N
	- How old are you? - Eighteen.
	我8岁. 那就是说在我18岁的时候   你就28了\N
	I'm 8. That means when I'm 18, you'll be 28.
	-而我28岁的时候  你也才38. -你的数学不错\N
	- And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38. - You're pretty good at arithmetic.
	当我38岁的时候   你48. 没多大区别\N
	And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. That's not much difference at all.
	有很大区别   尽管   不是吗?\N
	Sure is a lot now, though, huh?
	嘿   爱德华!\N
	Hey, Edward!
	我爱幽灵镇....\N
	I love Spectre...
	对不起\N
	Excuse me.
	珍妮 觉得你人不错 我们都这样认为\N
	Jenny thinks you're quite a catch. We all do.
	什么?\N
	What?
	我说   你人不错\N
	I said, you're quite a catch.
	我要走了\N
	I have to leave.
	今晚\N
	Tonight.
	为什么?\N
	Why?
	对这个镇我不能要求更多了\N
	This town is more than any man could ask for.
	如果我要在这停下来   我会觉得我的运气不错\N
	And if I were to end up here, I would consider myself lucky.
	但实际上是   我还没准备好在哪停下来\N
	But the truth is, I'm just not ready to end up anywhere.
	但是没人离开过这\N
	But no one's ever left.
	没鞋你怎么走?\N
	How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
	我想会疼. 很疼\N
	Well, I suspect it will hurt. A lot.
	对不起   但是.... 再见\N
	Now, I'm sorry, but... Well, goodbye.
	-你不会找到更好的地方的. -我也不想\N
	- You won't find a better place. - I don't expect to.
	答应我不要回来\N
	Promise me you'll come back.
	好的. 将来. 当我真的要回来的时候\N
	I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
	那晚   我有两个结论\N
	That night, I reached two conclusions.
	第一个是险路在黑暗中会变得更险\N
	The first was that a dangerous path is made much worse by darkness.
	第二个是我绝望而不不可避免地迷了路\N
	The second was that I was hopelessly and irrevocably lost.
	这些树林成了我的葬身之处\N
	These woods would become my graveyard.
	虽然去往幽灵镇的路困难重重 \N
	As difficult as it was to reach Spectre, 
	我还是注定最终到达了那里\N
	I was fated to get there eventually.
	毕竟  没有人可以逃避走到人生的尽头\N
	After all, no man can avoid reaching the end of his life.
	这时我认识到  这不是我的人生的尽头\N
	And then I realized this wasn't the end of my life.
	我不是这么死的\N
	This isn't how I die.
	朋友\N
	Friend.
	-你的鞋怎么了? -他们走在我的前头了\N
	- What happened to your shoes? - They kind of got ahead of me.
	我不知道你看见了没   但是傑瑟芬有照片...\N
	I don't know if you saw it, but Josephine had some photos...
	...就在最近的新闻周刊上\N
	...in the most recent Newsweek.
	真的吗?\N
	Really?
	太棒了\N
	That's just wonderful.
	我花了一周时间在摩洛哥拍那篇报道. 太不可思议了\N
	I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
	哦.我们要出个拷贝\N
	Oh. We'll have to pick up a copy.
	我不知道你有没有意识到   傑瑟芬...\N
	I don't know if you're aware of this, Josephine...
	...但是非洲鹦鹉  \N
	...but African parrots,
	在它们的老家刚果   他们只会说法语\N
	 in their native Congo, they speak only French.
	真的吗?\N
	Really?
	能让他们说几句英语你就很走运了\N
	You're lucky to get four words out of them in English.
	但是如果你穿过森林...\N
	But if you were to walk through the jungle...
	...你会听到它们说最棒的法语\N
	...you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French.
	那些鹦鹉什么都谈. 政治  电影  时装\N
	Those parrots talk about everything. Politics, movies, fashion.
	任何事情  除了宗教\N
	Everything but religion.
	为什么不说宗教   爸爸?\N
	Why not religion, Dad?
	说宗教太粗鲁了. 你不会知道你会冒犯什么的\N
	It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're gonna offend.
	傑瑟芬实际上去年去了刚果\N
	Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
	哦   所以你知道\N
	Oh, so you know.
	你好\N
	Hello.
	嗨.你怎么样?\N
	Hi. How are you feeling?
	哦   我在作梦\N
	Oh, I was dreaming.
	梦见什么了?\N
	What were you dreaming about?
	哦   我通常不太记得...\N
	Oh, I don't usually remember...
	...除非很有预兆. 你知道这些梦是什么意思吗?\N
	...unless they're especially portentous. Do you know what that word means?
	意思就是你梦见了可能发生的事\N
	It means when you dream about something that's gonna happen.
	就像那晚   我做了个梦...\N
	Like one night, I had a dream...
	...一只乌鸦飞过来说:\N
	...where this crow came and said:
	"你的阿姨会死"\N
	"Your aunt is gonna die."
	我很惊慌   叫醒了父母...\N
	I was so scared, I woke up my parents...
	...但是他们说只是个梦就又都睡了\N
	...but they said it was just a dream and to get back to bed.
	但是隔天早上   我的史坦斯阿姨就死了\N
	But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
	太可怕了\N
	That's terrible.
	对她来说太可怕了 \N
	Terrible for her,
	但是想想我   一个孩子有这种力量\N
	 but think about me, young boy with that kind of power.
	不到三周  那只乌鸦又到了我的梦中...\N
	Wasn't three weeks later when the crow came back to me in a dream...
	...说   "你爸爸会死"\N
	...and said, "Your daddy's gonna die."
	我不知道该怎么办\N
	I didn't know what to do.
	最后我告诉了我父亲   但他说:\N
	I finally told my father, but he said:
	"哦   不要担心." 但是我看的出他很慌张\N
	"Oh, not to worry." But I could see he was rattled.
	第二天   他变了个人\N
	The next morning, he wasn't himself.
	到处看   像是在等什么东西砸他脑袋\N
	Kept looking around, waiting for something to drop on his head.
	因为乌鸦没说会怎么样   只是说:\N
	Because the crow didn't say how it was gonna happen, just those words:
	"你爸爸会死"\N
	"Your daddy's gonna die."
	他很早出去  去了很久\N
	Well, he left home early and was gone a long time.
	当他回来的时候   他看上去脸色很吓人...\N
	When he finally came back, he looked terrible...
	...就像等了一天斧子掉下来\N
	...like he was waiting for the ax to fall all day.
	他跟妈妈说:\N
	He said to my mother:
	"这是我一生中最糟的一天"\N
	"I've just had the worst day of my life."
	"你觉得这是你一生中最糟的一天?" 她说\N
	"You think you've had a bad day?" she said.
	"这个早上   送牛奶的在台阶上死了"\N
	"This morning, the milkman dropped dead on the porch."
	因为我母亲和他偷情\N
	Because, see, my mother was banging the milkman.
	-我能给你拍张照吗? -哦   你不需要照片\N
	- Can I take your picture? - Oh, you don't need a picture.
	查一下 "英俊"这个词\N
	Just look up the word "handsome" in the dictionary.
	请?\N
	Please?
	好的\N
	All right.
	我在婚礼的照片上看到你\N
	I have photos of the wedding to show you.
	你和我父亲在一起很不错\N
	There is a great one of you and my father.
	我想看看你婚礼的照片 我没看过\N
	I want to see pictures of your wedding. I've never seen any.
	因为我们没举办过真正的婚礼\N
	That's because we didn't have a proper wedding.
	你的婆婆本不应嫁给我\N
	Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me.
	-她已经和别人订了婚. -我不知道\N
	- She was engaged to somebody else. - I never knew.
	威尔没有告诉你?\N
	Will never told you?
	可能这样也好\N
	Probably just as well.
	说不定他会讲错话\N
	He would have told it wrong, anyway.
	实际上   没有一点添油加醋\N
	All the facts, none of the flavor.
	哦. 这就是那个传说\N
	Oh. So this is a tall tale.
	故事并不短\N
	Well, it's not a short one.
	我刚刚离开幽灵镇去寻找我的使命\N
	I'd just left Spectre and was on my way to discover my destiny.
	我不太清楚那是什么...\N
	Not knowing what that would be exactly...
	...我寻找每个机会\N
	...I explored every opportunity that presented itself.
	可可! 可可! 他们在那\N
	Coco! Coco! There they are.

	You may think you've seen the unusual.
	你也许认为自己看到了荒诞的东西\N
	You may think you've seen the bizarre.
	但是我找遍了世界的任何角落...\N
	But I've traveled to the five corners of the world...
	...让你知道   我从没有看见过这种东西!\N
	...and let me tell you, I've never seen anything like this!
	当我遇见那个男人的时候...\N
	When I met this man...
	...他正在弗罗里达州摘桔子\N
	...he was picking oranges in Florida.
	他的同事叫他佩努. "影子"\N
	His fellow workers called him El Penumbra. "The Shadow."
	因为当你在他旁边干活时...\N
	Because when you worked beside him...
	...他把日光都挡住了!\N
	...he blocked out the daylight!
	不是吓你  夫人   但是如果那个人想要的话...\N
	Not to alarm you, ma'am, but if this man wanted to...
	...他可以用脚趾把你的脑袋夹扁...\N
	...he could crush your head between his toes...
	...就像捏一个小钱包. 不过他不会这么做的\N
	...like a tiny walnut. But he won't do it.
	不. 不   女士们先生们...\N
	No. No, ladies and gentlemen...
	...他不会伤害她...\N
	...he will not hurt her...
	...因为他是我们的巨人\N
	...because he is our own gentle giant.
	女士们先生们   我给你们带来了巨人!\N
	Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Colossus!
	女士们先生们   姑娘小伙子们...\N

	Drive home safely, everyone. Thank you for coming.
	在这个晚上卡尔找到了他的使命\N
	It was on that night Karl met his destiny.
	我也差点找到了我的\N
	And I met mine, almost.
	他们说当你碰到所爱的人的时候   时间停止了\N
	They say when you meet the love of your life, time stops.
	那是真的\N
	And that's true.
	当时间开始的时候没人告诉你...\N
	What they don't tell you is that once time starts again...

	It's just...
	没钱\N
	There's no money.
	我们完全破产了. 不要告诉任何人\N
	We're completely bankrupt. Don't tell anybody.
	结果储蓄和贷款的钱早已被洗劫一空...\N
	It turned out that the Savings & Loan had already been robbed...
	...不是被持枪的强盗  而是被德州的地产投机商抢走的\N
	...not by armed bandits, but by speculators in Texas real estate.
	好了   我们走!\N
	All right, let's go!
	诺什!\N
	Norther!
	对! 这里有$400!\N
	Yeah! There's gotta be close to $400 here!
	这还只是抽屉里的\N
	And that's just from the drawers.
	我们来看看你从金库里拿了多少\N
	Let's see what you got from the vault.
	这点吗? 整个金库里?\N
	This is it? The whole vault?
	恐怕是的\N
	I'm afraid so.
	有你的存款单\N
	It's got your deposit slip on it.
	我只是不想让你空手而归\N
	Well, I just didn't want you leaving empty-handed.
	有些事情你应该知道. 他们没钱的理由....\N
	There's something you should know. The reason they don't have money...
	我告诉诺什德州石油价格难以预计的变化...\N
	I told Norther about the vagaries of Texas oil money...
	...还有房地产价格效应...\N
	...and its effect on real-estate prices...
	...以及信託程序的不严格执行...\N
	...and how lax enforcement of fiduciary process...
	...已经使得储蓄和贷款减少\N
	...had made savings and loans particularly vulnerable.
	听到了这个  诺什留下了个结论:\N
	Hearing this news, Norther was left with one conclusion:
	我应该去华尔街. 钱都在那里\N
	I should go to Wall Street. That's where all the money is.
	我知道我犯罪的日子已经结束了...\N
	I knew then that while my days as a criminal were over...
	谢谢你的帮忙!\N
	Thanks for the hand!
	...诺什开始了\N
	...Norther's were just beginning.
	当诺什赚到了他的第一个100万时...\N
	When Norther made his first million dollars...
	...他给了我10  000的支票\N
	...he sent me a check for 10,000.
	我拒绝了   但他说这是他付给我的职业咨询费\N
	I protested, but he said it was my fee as his career advisor.
	这些钱足以给我的妻子买一栋有白色...\N
	It was enough to buy my wife a proper house...
	... 栅栏的房子\N
	...with a white picket fence.
	那就是男人对财富的最大梦想\N
	And for that, it was all the riches a man could ever want.
	我乾透了\N
	I was drying out.
	我知道\N
	I see.
	我看我们该给你买个洒水器...\N
	I think we ought to get you a plant mister...
	...那样我们就可以像浇花一样给你浇水了\N
	...so we can just spray you like a fern.
	来吧\N
	Come, now.
	我想我是永远不会干透的\N
	I don't think I'll ever dry out.
	你拿着. 我看看....\N
	You carry on. I'll see...
	你好\N
	Hello.
	-你是珍尼佛.希尔? -我是\N

	下周再上\N
	We can go again next week.
	我要把这个换给妈妈吗?\N
	Do I have to give it back to my mom?
	你不想说就不要说了\N
	Well, I won't tell her if you won't.
	你怎么认识我父亲的?\N
	How did you know my father?
	这是他去推销的必经之地...\N
	Well, this was on his sales route...
	...他经常经过这里  每个人都认识他\N
	...so he was through here all the time, and everyone in town knew him.
	你有事吗?\N
	Were you having an affair?
	哇. 哇   你说了\N
	Wow. Wow, you just said it.
	我还准备再绕上半小时呢\N
	I was expecting to dance around this for another half-hour.
	我见过他和这个女人在一起. 他和她调情. 他一直这样\N
	I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has.
	从某种程度上看   我只是猜测...\N
	And on some level, I just presumed that he was...
	...他欺骗了我妈 但是我没有证据\N
	...cheating on my mom. I just never had proof.
	我能问个问题吗?\N
	Well, can I ask you a question?
	如果你找到了契约   为什么不问艾迪?\N
	If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
	因为他快死了\N
	Because he's dying.
	看   我不知道你瞭解多少情况\N
	Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this.
	你对你父亲有印象...\N
	You have one image of your father...
	...我不应该改变它...\N
	...and it'd be wrong of me to change it...
	...尤其是在游戏的结尾\N
	...especially this late in the game.
	我父亲说了他从来没说过的事...\N
	My father talked about things he never did...
	...我相信这些他从没有说过\N
	...and I'm sure he did a lot of things that he never talked about.
	我试着在两者之间找到共同点\N
	I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
	首先你要瞭解...\N
	The first thing you have to understand...
	...你父亲没想到会来这\N
	...is that your father never meant to end up here.
	然而他来了\N
	Yet he did.
	两次\N
	Twice.
	第一次   他来早了\N
	The first time, he was early.
	第二次   他来晚了\N
	The second time, he was late.
	那些日子  你父亲为自己工作\N

	爱德华.布鲁是这样一个人...\N
	If there's one thing you could say about Edward Bloom...
	...他是个喜欢社交的人   大家都喜欢和他说话\N
	...it's that he was a social person, and people took a liking to him.
	一天晚上   他出门三周后回来...\N
	One night, he was returning from three weeks on the road...
	... 遇上了从没碰到过的暴风雨\N
	...when he hit a thunderstorm unlike any in his life.
	命运就是喜欢捉弄人...\N
	Fate has a way of circling back on a man...
	...让他大吃一惊\N
	...and taking him by surprise.
	一个人在生命的各种时段看事物角度也是不同的\N
	A man sees things differently at different times in his life.
	这个镇在年老的他看来已经不同了\N
	This town didn't seem the same now that he was older.
	一条新路已经把外面的世界带进了幽灵镇...\N
	A new road had brought the outside world to Spectre...
	...随之而来的是  银行  抵押和债务\N
	...and with it, banks, liens and debt.
	只要你看的到的地方   就有人破产\N
	Almost everywhere you looked, people were bankrupt.
	今天为幽灵镇举行一次拍卖\N
	The auction today is for the town of Spectre.
	-开价 $1 0  000. -於是爱德华.布鲁...\N
	- The opening bid will be $ 10,000. - So Edward Bloom...
	-...决定买下这个镇 -50  000.\N
	...decided to buy the town. - 50,000.
	-我不能相信我的眼睛-- -他从来不是个有钱的人...\N
	- I couldn't believe my eyes... - He was never a wealthy man...
	...但是他能让别人变的有钱   现在他找他们帮忙\N
	...but he had made other men rich, and now he asked for their favors.
	-我决定存.... -他们中的大多数人没见过幽灵镇\N
	- I'm trying to save... - Most of them hadn't seen Spectre.
	只是听爱德华描述过\N
	They only had Edward's words to describe it.
	有这些已经够了. 他卖了出去\N
	That's all he needed. He sold them on the dream.
	首先他买了农场\N
	So first he bought the farms.
	然后是房子. 接着是商店\N
	Then he bought the houses. And then he bought the stores.
	他买的地方   里面的人都不用离开或者付房租\N
	Whatever he bought, the people were not asked to leave or pay rent.
	他们被要求像平时一样生活\N
	They were just asked to keep doing as they were doing.
	那样   他就能保证这个镇不会灭亡\N
	In that way, he could make sure the town would never die.
	在6个月里   整个镇都信任了他\N
	Within six months, his trust had purchased the entire town.
	所有的人\N
	With one exception.
	你一定是爱德华 布鲁\N
	You must be Edward Bloom.
	你怎么知道的?\N
	How do you know?
	不会有人没事来这里的\N
	No one would come out here unless they had business.
	除了你也没人会来找我\N
	And no one would have business with me except for you.
	你把镇买下来了\N
	You're buying the town.
	显然我注意到了   我要弥补一下\N
	Apparently I overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that.
	为了让这个镇保全下来   整个镇子\N
	In order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it, in its entirety.
	我听说了\N
	And so I've heard.
	我会高价买下来. 你不必搬\N
	I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you won't have to move.
	契约上除了名字什么都不会变\N
	Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
	我跟你直说吧\N
	Now, let me get this straight.
	你从我这里把沼泽买走   但我可以住在里面?\N
	You buy the swamp from me, but I'll stay in it?
	你将拥有这房子   可这里还是我住?\N
	You'll own the house, but it'll still be mine?
	我住这   你可以自由出入\N
	I'll be here, and you'll come and go as you please to one place or another.
	对吗?\N
	Do I have that right?
	应该说   是的\N
	In so many words, yes.
	对   我不这么想   布鲁先生\N
	Yeah, then I don't think so, Mr. Bloom.
	如果能不改变   我宁愿不要改变...\N
	If nothing's gonna change, I'd just as soon it not change...
	...这些东西我很久没变了\N
	...in the way things haven't been changing all this time.
	你什么也不会失去. 你可以问问镇上的其他人\N
	It's not like you'll lose anything. You can ask anyone in town.
	你为什么要买下这   布鲁先生?\N
	Why are you buying this land, Mr. Bloom?
	某种中年危机吗?\N
	Some sort of midlife crisis?
	你不买债券  买镇子?\N
	Instead of buying a convertible, you buy a town?
	助人为乐\N
	Helping people makes me happy.
	我不认为你会开心\N
	I'm not convinced you should be happy.
	-对不起. 我有没有冒犯你? -没\N
	- I'm sorry. Have I offended you? - No.
	你遵守了承诺\N
	You did exactly what you promised.
	你回来了. 我还以为会更早点\N
	You came back. I was just expecting you sooner.
	你是比曼的女儿\N
	You're Beamen's daughter.
	名字变了. 你结婚了吗?\N
	Your name's different. Did you get married?
	我18. 他28. 差很多\N
	I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
	我不会把房子卖给你的   布鲁先生\N
	I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
	我知道\N
	I see.
	谢谢你\N
	Well, thank you for your time.
	-门卡住了 -是\N
	- It's stuck. - Yeah.
	-哦   对不起! 我-- -好了. 别管了\N
	- Oh, I'm so sorry! l... - It's okay. Just leave it.
	-不   我-- -请! 走吧\N
	- No, I'll... - Please! Just go.
	-但是-- -走吧\N
	- But... - Go.
	大多数人在这种情况下会接受失败继续走下去\N
	Most men in that situation would accept their failure and move on.
	但是爱德华不在其中\N
	But Edward was not like most men.
	但是爱德华不在其中\N
	But Edward was not like most men.
	停!\N
	Hold!
	他们的性格完全不同但是...\N
	They both had completely different characters but...
	...只有两条腿\N
	...well, just one pair of legs.
	几个月过去了   他找了很多东西修理...\N
	As the months passed, he found more and more things to fix...
	...直到那小屋完全变了一个模样\N
	...until the shack no longer resembled itself.
	当然   最好的地方是材料换了\N
	Of course, the best part was coming up with the new material.
	当我和双胞胎去哈瓦那时...\N
	By the time the twins and I had got to Havana...
	...我们想出了一条新路线  \N
	...we'd worked out a new routine, 
	只用一把尤格里里琴和一只口琴\N
	using only a ukulele and a harmonica.
	-那么.... -你可以离开那了\N
	- Well... - You could leave it there.

	As for the girl...
	...通常的说法是她变成了女巫...\N
	...the common belief was that she'd become a witch...
	...并很疯狂於此\N
	...and crazy at that.
	她自己成了一个传奇\N
	She became something of a legend herself.
	这个故事在开始的时候就结束了\N
	And the story ended where it began.
	逻辑上来看   你不能成为女巫   因为她...\N
	Logically, you couldn't be the witch, because she was...
	...在他小的时候就很老了\N
	...old when he was young.
	你像你父亲那样思考才符合逻辑\N
	Well, it's logical if you think like your father.
	对於他来说只有两种女人:\N
	See, to him there's only two women:
	你的母亲...\N

	...and everyone else.
	一天...\N

	假如他醒了   我应该在这里\N
	In case he wakes up, I really ought to be here.
	我留下来\N
	I'll stay.

	很高兴看见你不是来真心谈话的\N
	Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk.
	我最烦的一件事就是...\N
	One of my greatest annoyances is when...
	...和不想听的人倾诉\N
	...people try to talk to those who can't hear them.
	我们有优势\N
	Well, we have an advantage.
	我和父亲从来不说话\N
	My father and I never talk.
	你父亲告诉过你关於你出生那天的事吗?\N
	Your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
	对   1000多次了. 他抓住了那条抓不到的鱼的事\N

	You were born a week early, but there were no complications.
	接生非常成功. 你父亲很遗憾没在场\N
	It was a perfect delivery. Your father was sorry not to be there.
	不过那时男人都不进产房...\N
	But it wasn't the custom then for men to be in the room for deliveries...
	...所以我不明白他在场的话会有多少不同\N
	...so I can't see how it would've been much different had he been there.
	那就是你出生的真实故事\N
	And that's the real story of how you were born.
	不是很有意思   对吗?\N
	Not very exciting, is it?
	我只能在真实的版本...\N
	And I suppose if I had to choose between the true version...
	...和关於鱼和婚戒的精美故事...\N
	...and an elaborate one involving a fish and a wedding ring...
	...做出选择\N
	...I might choose the fancy version.
	但是   那是我\N
	But, then that's just me.
	我喜欢的版本\N
	I kind of liked your version.

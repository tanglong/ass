怎么回事啊
what happened, you know?

124

我只知道  你还有四个小时就得上班了
What I know is that you need to be at work in four hours.

我们不能再借你们钱了
"We can't lend you any more."

128
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,080
他也没有恶意

129
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,800
就那么站在厨房里看着我

You're drunk, so the best thing you could do right now is to shut up.

132
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,920
我知道IBM的能耐
I know what IBM is.

133
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,560
但我也了解它的缺点
I also know what IBM ain't,

134
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,070
它最慢最贵最不好使
and everything that ain't IBM is cheaper, faster, and better,

135
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,620
所以我们才有活路
and that's what this company lives by.

You know, Dallas is a long way from Armonk, New York, son.

145
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,230
-这可不是巧合  -您说的很对
- That's no accident. - I couldn't agree with you more.

146
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,980
但我或许就是不想再那样做事了
But maybe I'm a guy who's done doing business like that.

147
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,390
我认为  卡迪夫电子作为二线公司
Maybe I see Cardiff Electric as a mid-majo

148
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,760
到了更进一步的时候了

I will tell you this... it's system software, straight up.

155
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,210
不是应用程序  下一代计算机之类的垃圾
No application, no next-gen PC garbage.

156
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,530
也许不炫目  但能赚钱
It ain't sexy, but it sure as hell make us some serious money.

157

我不喜欢东海岸
Don't like East Coast corporate.

160

说得那么牛  你连份简历都没带
Hell, hotshot, you didn't bring in a damn resume.

161

Box one is my last reported income at IBM.

163

It's also what 200% of quota looks like.

164
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,660

The golden circle.

00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,030
-懂吗  -我懂
- Do you understand? - I do.

169
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,390
懂  那就好
I "Do." Good.

170
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,400
就这么定了
Well, we're married.

00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,350
而能设想未来的电脑的人手里
but for everything they have the potential to be."

279
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,840
什么
What?

280
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,010
你知道这话谁说的吗
You know who said that?

281
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,700
不  我不知道
No, no, I don't.

282
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,770
你说的
You did.

283
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,230
36页  最后一段
Page 36, closing paragraph.

284
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,910
电脑不是终点
Computers aren't the thing.

285
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,020
只是我们达到终点的工具
They're the thing that gets us to the thing.

{\pos(150,56)}开放式架构的未来

287
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,440
{\pos(248,136)}作者  戈登·克拉克

288
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,380
在电路板上
Over here on the circuit board,

289
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,890
可以看到ROM芯片  就像大脑一样
you've got the ROM chip. That's like the brain

290
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,890
{\an8}只读存储器

291
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,620
用来记录所有单词
that remembers all the words...

292
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:53,150
容量有128千比特  那是好多单词呢
128 kilobits worth. That is a lot of words.

293
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,050
这个是真空荧光显示器
And then you've got your VFD display right here.

294
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,200
这是负责显示单词的
That's the part that shows you the words.

295
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,660
这里是语言合成芯片
And the speech synthesizer chip right here,

296
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,580
这块很特别  是妈妈的公司制造的
that is the extra-special one they make where Mommy works.

297
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,680
我来接
I got it.

298
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,310
你好
Hello?

299
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,310
乔·麦克米伦找你
It's somebody named Joe MacMillan.

300
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,290
我们正要出门看电影
We're headed out the door to a movie.

301
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,260
-回头让他打给你  -这块特别芯片是做什么的
- Can I have him call you back? -What does the special chip do?

302
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,230
这个芯片能让机器说话
Oh, um, the chip makes it talk.

303
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,890
就像你和我说话一样
You know, like you and me.

304
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,360
你能让它说话吗
Can you make it talk?

305
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,920
现在不行  丫头
Not right now, kiddo.

306
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,700
琼妮  去准备好出发看电影吧
Hey, Joanie, why don't you go get ready for the movie, 'kay?

307
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,630
他想问你有没有考虑过他的话
He wanted to know if you thought about what he said.

308
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,880
那篇在《字节》上刊登的文章
That article I wrote in "Byte."

309
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,310
怎么了
What about it?

310
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,980
他有些计划
He had some ideas about it.

311
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,770
是吗  什么计划
Oh, yeah? What kind of ideas?

312
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,490
我不知道
I don't know.

313
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,360
不重要
It doesn't really matter.

314
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,910
回家把另外两部《星球大战》看了
Go home and watch the other two "Star Wars"?

315
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,390
想今晚看吗
You wanna do that tonight? 

316
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,020
我是乔·麦克米伦
Joe MacMillan.

317
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,720
我们之前通过电话
We spoke on the phone earlier.

318
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,080
你跟踪我过来的
Did you follow me here?

319
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,430
你丈夫是我在卡迪夫电子遇到的最好的销售工程师
Your husband is the best SE I've worked with at Cardiff Electric.

320
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,450
当然  我才在那里工作了一周
Now, granted, I've only been there a week.

321
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,060
我能私下和戈登说句话吗
Do you mind if I borrow Gordon for one second?

322
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,570
-来吧  -外面见
- Come on. - Hey, I'll see you guys outside.

323
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,310
好啊  也许吧  如果爸爸同意的话
Yeah, maybe, if Daddy lets us.

324
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,590
和我一起逆向工程一台IBM个人电脑
Reverse engineer an IBM PC with me.

325
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,560
什么  为什么  目的是什么
What? Why? What would be the point?

326
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,460
因为我想做一台别人没胆子做的电脑
Because I want to build a machine that nobody else has the balls to build.

327
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,690
你是认真的
Wow, you're serious.

328
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,310
听着  这主意很糟
Look, that's a terrible idea.

329
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:48,120
-为什么  -有很多理由...
- Why? - For such a multitude of reasons that I...

330
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,430
因为这么做是违法的
because it's illegal.

331
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,320
最糟糕的情况是  IBM把我们告倒
Worst-case scenario, IBM sues us into the ground.

332
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,910
卡迪夫发现了  会把我们都扫地出门
Uh, Cardiff finds out, then both of us would be on the street.

333
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,090
苹果  IBM  他们已经占领了市场
Apple, IBM, they have the market sewn up.

334
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:06,240
还要对付康懋达  坦迪公司和德州仪器
Plus, you got Commodore, Tandy, Texas Instruments.

335
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:06,240
{\an8}均为八十年代如日中天的电脑公司

336
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,650
抱歉  但你已经错失良机
I'm sorry, but you missed it.

337
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,550
我们都是
We all did.

338
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,800
戈登  等等
Gordon, wait, wait.

339
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,000
所以我们要以卡迪夫电子的名义做
That's why we do it as Cardiff Electric.

340
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,140
马上能规模化生产
Scale up instantly.

341
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,750
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

342
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,130
博斯沃思和卡迪夫这样的老糊涂绝不会同意...
Buzzards like Bosworth and Cardiff would never go for something...

343
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,490
-那我们就逼他们  -逼他们吗
- So we force their hand. - Force their hand?

344
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,060
你要怎么逼他们
How are you gonna force their hand?

345
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,970
这让我去操心
Let me worry about that part.

346
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,660
爸爸
Dad!

347
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,060
-快来呀  爸爸  -快点
- Come on, Dad! - Hurry!

348
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,150
你有家室吗  乔
Do you have a family, Joe?

349
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,200
我猜也是
That's what I thought.

350
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,780
谢谢  但还是不了
Look, thanks, but no thanks.

351
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,530
那就是乔·麦克米伦吗
So, that was Joe MacMillan, huh?

352
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,510
他跟踪我们一家到电影院  戈登
He stalked our family to the movies, Gordon.

353
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,220
你至少得承认他很疯狂
Could you please acknowledge how crazy that is?

354
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,520
他就是对一件事挺来劲
He's just keyed up about something.

355
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,050
他想要什么
What does he want?

356
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,590
他想搭建一台电脑
He wants to build a computer.

357
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,170
跟你有什么关系
And what does that have to do with you?

358
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,320
戈登
Gordon?

359
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,370
戈登  我们输不起第二次了  你知道的
Gordon, we can't do this again. You know we can't.

360
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,160
听着  我知道  好吗  我知道
Look, I know, okay? I know.

361
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,560
你真知道吗  我之前不得不
Do you know? Because I just had to spread the payments

362
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,800
-划了三张信用卡支付  -老天  唐娜
- for Joanie's next dental visit - Oh, my God, Donna.

363
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,000
琼妮下次的牙齿检查
over three credit cards.

364
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,650
我们真的不能再犯这种错了
It's just literally a mistake that we can't afford to make again.

365
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,200
听着  交响乐是个好主意
Look, the Symphonic was a good idea.

366
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,710
我知道你还这么认为
I know you still think so.

367
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:52,480
-交响乐是什么  -就是个破电脑
- What's a Symphonic? - It's a silly computer.

368
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,760
妈妈和爸爸搭建的  但不好使
Mommy and Daddy built that didn't work.

369
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:00,970
交响乐...是你爸爸做过的最棒的东西
The Symphonic... was the best thing your dad ever did.

370
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,200
{\pos(234,136)}全力以赴  儿子

371
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,620
你知不知道这玩意有多贵
Do you have any idea how expensive this thing was?

372
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,910
唐娜周末三天带孩子去她哥哥那儿
Donna took the kids to see her brother for the three-day weekend.

373
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,740
我假装发烧...
I faked a fever, so...

374
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,390
把这玩意拆个底朝天吧
let's turn this thing inside out.

375
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,780
个人电脑  和所有其他电脑一样
A personal computer, like any other computer,

376
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:08,210
只是个装满了电子开关和硬件的空盒子
is just a nothing box full of electronic switches and hardware.

377
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,020
像什么IBM电脑  阿尔泰电脑  苹果二号
You know, the IBM, the Altair, the Apple II...

378
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,820
原理都那个鬼样
it's all the same junk.

379
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,720
随便什么人都能立马在商店买到这些
Anyone can buy all this stuff off the shelf right now.

380
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,810
这就叫"开放式架构"
It's called "Open architecture."

381
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,010
机子里的东西  基本上没一件是IBM的
I mean, IBM, they basically don't own anything inside the machine.

382
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,440
除了芯片
Except the chip.

383
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,290
对  除了芯片上的内容
Yeah, well, except what's on the chip.

384
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,840
BIOS就在这其中一块芯片上  只是不知是哪个
The BIOS is on one of these chips, we just don't know which one.

385
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,840
{\an8}基本输入输出系统

386
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,090
ROM BIOS是IBM唯一真正设计的部分
The ROM BIOS is the only part of the machine IBM actually designed.

387
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:36,840
这就是程序所在  奇迹所在
I mean, it is the program, it is the magic.

388
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:40,680
但是  他们握有版权  只有他们知道工作原理
The bad news is they copyrighted it and they own how it works.

389
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:45,230
好在  可以算是有办法破解
The good news is there's a way around that, sort of.

390
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,230
逆向工程
Reverse engineering.

391
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,200
对  把示波器给我
Right, grab me the oscilloscope.

392
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,630
还有纸笔  把各引脚电压记下来
And a pen and paper. We need to record these pin voltages.

393
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,630
{\an8}从集成电路[芯片]内部电路引出与外围电路的接线

394
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,050
这事我有点生疏了
I am a little rusty at this.

395
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,430
开始
Yeah.

396
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,700
正五伏
Plus five?

397
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,190
下一个
Yeah.

398
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,590
-零  -下一个
- Zero? - Mm-hmm.

399
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:09,290
-零  -下一个
- Zero. - Mm-hmm.

400
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,710
-正五伏  -下一个
- Plus five. - Yeah.

401
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,900
-零  -下一个
- Zero. - Mm-hmm.

402
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,100
-正五伏  -错了
- Plus five. - No.

403
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,240
-零  -下一个
- Zero. - Yeah.

404
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,960
-正五伏  还是零  -没错
- Plus five? Zero. - Yeah.

405
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,680
-负五伏  -嗯  下一个
- Minus five? - Yeah, yeah.

406
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,770
-零  -下一个
- Zero. - Yeah.

407
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,300
-负五伏  -下一个
- Minus five. - Yeah.

408
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,570
零
Zero.

409
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,160
-下一个  -正五伏
- Yeah. - Plus five?

410
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,610
好了  看看效果吧
That's it. Let's get to work.

411
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,070
很好  把这些数字记下来
All right, write these numbers down.

412
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,740
2-8-0-0...

413
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,940
1-3-1-6...

414
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,650
0-4-5-6...

415
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,840
慢着慢着  记这些干什么
Wait, wait, wait, what am I doing here?

416
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,590
这里记的是地址的数据  明白吗
We're writing down the contents of the addresses, all right?

417
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,540
每组四个小灯代表着一个十六进制数
So each group of four lights represents a hex digit.

418
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,370
我明白十六进制代码是什么
I understand hexadecimal code.

419
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,700
你是怎么从这些灯上读出数字的
How are you getting this from that?

420
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,430
第一行这一组  表示字母B
This first line, that's a B.

421
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,040
两开一闭一开
Two on, one off, one on.

422
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,810
第二行表示字母E
Okay, second line here, E.

423
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,590
-三开一闭  -我懂了  我懂了
- Three on, one off... - Oh, I get it, I get it.

424
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,090
我们需要编译多少个这样的地址
How many of these addresses do we need to transcribe?

425
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,270
65,536.

426
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,500
E421
E-4-2-1.

427
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,690
8-0... c-4... c-2-7-2...

428
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,620
3-8-7-9...

429
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,110
C910
C-9-1-0...

430
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,720
4C
4-c...

431
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,990
1-9-2-1...

432
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,970
6C94
6-c-9-4.

433
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,590
好了  启动显示器吧
All right, fire up the monitor.

434
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,200
我去煮点咖啡
I'm gonna go put on some coffee.

435
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,500
编译完了吗
Are we done?

436
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,210
这一部分弄完了
With this part.

437
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,590
好了
All right...

438
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,520
看看弄对了没
let's see if we got it right.

439
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,870
出现命令行了  好兆头
There's a prompt. That's a good sign.

440
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,480
你还真从大海里捞到针了
You found a needle in a haystack.

441
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,490
先别急  启动打印机吧
Now, hold on. Let's fire up the printer.

442
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,990
还有的忙活呢
We still have a lot to do.

443
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,560
这就是IBM电脑的ROM BIOS
The IBM PC-ROM BIOS.

444
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,300
是汇编语言代码
That's the assembly language code.

445
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,530
现在我们做自己的芯片吧
Now we do our own chip.

446
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,120
这个  我
Well, I mean...

447
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,420
我就说吧
I told you.

448
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,730
你画了张藏宝图
It's a treasure map.

449
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,570
大概吧  但是
Yeah, maybe, but look...

450
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,270
我们得好好喝一杯庆祝一下
Oh, this definitely calls for a toast...

451
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,600
糟了
Oh, shit.

452
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,090
我以为你周一才回来呢
I-I thought you weren't gonna be back till Monday.

453
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,370
今天就是周一
It is Monday.

454
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,010
海莉病了  我还以为她被你传染了
Haley's sick. I figured she caught whatever you had,

455
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,900
但看你这样子  显然是生龙活虎啊
but looking at you now, I can tell that you're not sick at all.

456
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,600
这一堆东西不会全是你买的吧
Would you please tell me that you didn't buy all this?

457
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,500
其实事情是这样的
Maybe I can help explain...

458
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,530
我想跟我丈夫
I'd like to speak to my husband...

459
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,650
单独谈谈
privately.

460
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,490
-亲爱的  听我解释  -我实在不懂
- Honey, just let me explain... - I really don't understand.

461
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,780
-你好歹听我解释下  -你为什么骗我
- Let me just defend myself here. - Why would you lie to me?

462
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,070
我没骗你
Hold on, I did not lie to you

463
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,370
-我没骗你啊  -你就是骗了
- about anything. - You did, you lied.

464
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,680
-我没骗你  -戈登你又回老路上去了
- No, I did not lie to you. - Gordon, this is going backwards.

465
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,910
这才是我真正想做的事
This right here, this is what I want to do with my life!

466
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,710
是啊  可你知道你在拿什么冒险吗
Yes, but don't you realize what you're risking?

467
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,980
你知道自己现在拥有什么吗
Don't you realize what you have now?

468
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,890
那不够
Well, it's not enough.

469
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,870
好吗  很抱歉  但那不够
Okay? I'm sorry, it's not enough.

470
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,680
好吧
Okay.

471
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,860
对我来说  这一直都足够了
Well, it always has been enough for me.

472
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,290
唐娜  别这样
Come on, Donna, don't be like that.

473
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,580
但毕竟我没有一心认定自己是
But I guess I never had the burden of believing

474
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,770
被误解的天才
that I was some misunderstood genius.

475
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,380
妈妈送你去上床睡觉
Let's put you to bed.

476
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,780
-约翰  -没空
- John? - Nope.

477
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,820
抱歉  这电话你得接
I'm sorry, but I think you'll wanna take this.

478
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,200
老婆今晚做肉排呢
Mama makin' pork chops tonight.

479
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,450
是IBM
It's IBM.

480
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,650
我是博斯沃思
Bosworth here.

481
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,560
约翰  我是戴尔·巴特勒
John, it's Dale Butler,

482
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,010
北美销售部高级副总裁
Senior Vice President of Sales, North America.

483
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,590
有什么事吗  戴尔
What can I do you for, Dale?

484
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,930
我有个手下在你那儿
You got one of my boys down there.

485
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,220
是啊
Why, yes, we do.

486
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,470
麦克米伦
MacMillan.

487
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,280
人挺有意思
Interesting fella.

488
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,950
可以说我很高兴他还活着
I guess I can say it's good to know he's alive.

489
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,890
怎么说
How so?

490
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,160
乔去年三月离开了公司
Joe walked out the front door of our offices last March.

491
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,810
然后呢
And?

492
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,870
再也没回来
And he never came back.

493
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,710
我有点糊涂了  戴尔
You lost me, Dale.

494
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:19,230
这一年多  没人有乔·麦克米伦的消息
No one has seen or heard from Joe MacMillan in more than a year.

495
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,950
我们都报警了
We even filed police reports.

496
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,000
我们听说他去给你工作之前
Up until we caught wind he was working for you,

497
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,600
还一直以为他死了  没想到是这样
we believed the worst, but here we are.

498
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,010
他这人有问题  约翰
He's damaged goods, John.

499
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:32,660
真希望我能早点给你提个醒  现在大概太迟了
I wish I could've warned you, but now it might be too late.

500
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,570
怎么说
How so?

501
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:39,170
丽贝卡·泰勒  我公司法律顾问也在这儿
I'm here with Rebecca Taylor, our in-house legal counsel.

502
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,750
你好  约翰
Hi, John.

503
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,320
现在有个问题
We've got a problem.

504
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,410
你俩  给我坐下
You two... sit down.

505
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,490
这位是内森·卡迪夫
This here is Nathan Cardiff.

506
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,310
你毁掉的公司是他的
He owns the company you destroyed.

507
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,510
我们刚跟IBM的律师团和你之前的上司
We just got done with a two-and-a-half-hour jaw with

508
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:12,450
戴尔·巴特勒谈了两个半小时
IBM's legal team, including your old boss, Dale Butler.

509
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,800
是吗  他怎么样了
Oh, yeah? How's he doing?

510
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,080
他好得很呢
Oh, he's doing pretty splendid,

511
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,950
因为蓝色巨人就要把我们告到破产
given the fact that Big Blue is gonna liquidate this company

512
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:24,230
补偿他们数千万的损失
to the tune of several dozen million dollars in legal damages

513
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,730
全拜你们两个盗窃人家
because two idiot children in our employ

514
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,920
旗舰产品的熊孩子所赐
decided to rip off their flagship product.

515
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,610
先生  其实不是那样的
Sir, that wasn't the idea.

516
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:31,830
我们没想给公司惹麻烦
We did this solely on our own.

517
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,940
你们怎么想的无所谓
It turns out that doesn't matter...

518
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,880
相信我  我们本打算把你们扔出去喂狼的
and, believe me, we tried to feed you to the wolves, boys.

519
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,700
但麦克米伦在IBM工作过
But because MacMillan here worked at IBM

520
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,190
而你们俩搞那个小项目时都已是我们的员工
and you two were in our employ at the time of your little project,

521
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,900
所以无论好赖  那个项目都属于我们公司了
that project is ours now, for better or worse.

522
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,460
赖  绝对是赖
Worse, in this case.

523
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,130
巴特勒和那个女人  泰勒  明天就要来
Butler and that woman Taylor are headed down here tomorrow.

524
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,630
先生  IBM是怎么知道的
Sir, how the hell did IBM find out about this?

525
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,870
我告诉他们的
I told them.

526
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,120
你就这么强迫他们
That's how you force their hand?

527
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,120
你给IBM通风报信
You call IBM?

528
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,550
让大家都冷静一下就好了
Just let everybody cool off.

529
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,480
我妻子就担心...
This is exactly what my wife...

530
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,490
乔  看着我  我跟你不一样
Joe, look at me. I'm not like you, okay?

531
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,880
我有老婆孩子  有按揭
I have a wife, kids, a mortgage, okay?

532
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,500
我本来好好的  你非要把那篇破文章拿出来
I was fine until you threw that stupid article in my face

533
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,390
给了我...
and gave me some...

534
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:14,320
什么  我给了你什么  戈登
What? What did I give you, Gordon?

535
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,030
-去你妈的  乔  -很好  生气吧
- Oh, go to hell, Joe. - Good! Get angry, get angry!

536
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,900
找出点感觉来  就像在车库里那样
Feel something, like you did in that garage,

537
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,050
因为只有这样我们才能得到我们想要的
because this is the only way we get what we want.

538
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,230
没什么"我们"可言  乔
There is no "We," Joe.

539
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,820
我们现在是一条船上的了
There is now.

540
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,750
两年前我去了计算机分销商展览
I was at COMDEX two years ago.

541
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:32,610
我看到了交响乐的展示  它超越了时代
I saw the Symphonic demo. It was ahead of its time.

542
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,610
那是当时  现在我们在这儿  一年后
That was then, this is now... and a year from now,

543
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,870
你会感谢我的  你是个建造者  戈登
you're gonna thank me. You're a builder, Gordon.

544
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,700
我不是  我现在不是了
No, I'm not, okay? Not anymore.

545
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,480
给我听明白
All right? Get that through your head.

546
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,840
-好极了  -好棒
- Yeah. - Yes.

547
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,690
我觉得你可能需要休息一下
I figured you needed a break.

548
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,790
爸爸  你修好了
Daddy, you fixed it!

549
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,690
是啊  打开吧
Yeah, well, turn it on.

550
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,170
你好  琼妮
Hello, Joanie.

551
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,980
你怎么让它喊我名字的
How'd you get it to say my name?

552
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,590
我编了程
Well, I programmed it.

553
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:16,580
拼个什么给我听听
Now spell something for me.

554
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,780
爸...爸
D-a-d-d-y.

555
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,200
那是什么意思
What's that spell?

556
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:36,190
听我说  我最近很差劲
Look, I've been awful.

557
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,080
真抱歉
I'm sorry.

558
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,910
我知道你觉得你需要这个
I know you think you need this.

559
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:46,160
不管这究竟是什么  我应该是拦不住你
And whatever it is, I'm pretty sure I can't stop you.

560
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,180
我知道  但我已经停手了
Yeah, I know. I've already stopped.

561
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,080
电脑  我的工作  
Computers, my job...

562
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,320
都不重要
none of that matters.

563
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,370
离了你都不重要了
Not without you.

564
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,820
去做吧
Build it.

565
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,590
不管你想做出个什么来  去做吧
Whatever it is you're dreaming of, build it.

566
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,820
我知道你能创造奇迹
I know you can make it great.

567
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,820
但你听好
But here's the deal.

568
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,000
如果你要跟乔·麦克米伦搭档
You wanna partner with Joe MacMillan...

569
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,350
那么在家里  你要做我的搭档
then you partner with me and this family.

570
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,720
好
Yeah.

571
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,520
没问题
Deal.

572
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,980
我们为什么不能炒了这俩混蛋
Why can't we fire these peckerheads?

573
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,790
那样你就会输了官司
Because then you'll lose this lawsuit.

574
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,150
开除他们  搁置他们的项目
Fire them, shelve their work,

575
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,610
那么就等于承认有罪
you're essentially admitting guilt.

576
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,540
那么我们怎么办  巴瑞
Okay, so what's the solution, Barry?

577
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,770
把项目合法化
We legitimize the project.

578
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,410
-什么  -反其道而行之
- What? - Go the other way.

579
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,460
我们就说卡迪夫电子公司
We say Cardiff Electric as a company

580
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,200
本来就在研发个人电脑
has been pursuing PC development all along.

581
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,340
我不明白这能解决什么...
I don't see how the hell that'd solve any...

582
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,690
你拿克拉克对BIOS芯片的研究
You take Clark's findings on the BIOS chip,

583
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,160
找个工程师建造一个运行原理
you tell an engineer to build a unit that operates and performs

584
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,690
完全相同的芯片  但别告诉他怎么做
in exactly the same way, but you don't tell him how to do it.

585
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,400
我们手下怕是没有一个工程师
Hell, I don't think we have one engineer

586
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,540
能凭空造出一个BIOS芯片
capable of building a BIOS from scratch

587
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,120
大概除了这位大明星
other than "Sonny Bono" over here.

588
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,910
我们不能用他  或是其他任何目前的员工
And you can't use him or any other engineer we currently employ.

589
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,790
还得另外雇吗
So we have to hire?

590
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,810
是的  还得是个跟我们和IBM都没关系
Yes, someone who doesn't know us or IBM

591
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,090
而且没看过这份资料的人
and certainly hasn't seen the contents of this binder.

592
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,340
总之  法律规定
Essentially, all the law stipulates

593
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,900
他不能亲自插手建造芯片
is that he can't be hands-on in the actual chip creation.

594
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,780
-我们还不能炒了他们  -对  现在不行
- And we can't fire them. - No, not right now.

595
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:39,650
那么我们的出路就是真建一台克隆电脑吗
So we get out of this by actually building a PC clone?

596
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:42,750
这就是你的救命高招吗  巴瑞
This is your brilliant idea to save our hides, Barry?

597
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,040
老天爷啊
For God's sake, man!

598
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,530
不是
No.

599
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,780
其实  这是麦克米伦的主意
Actually, it was MacMillan's.

600
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,200
你个兔崽子
You son of a bitch.

601
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,020
你昨天怎么不说
Now, why didn't you tell me about this yesterday?

602
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,140
我得让你别无选择
I needed you to exhaust your options

603
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,100
那样你才会认真对待
so that you would take this one seriously.

604
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,320
你知道你这是拿多少人的前途开玩笑吗  小子
Do you know how many futures you're toying with here, son?

605
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,960
售卖系统软件
Selling systems software,

606
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,190
我或许能给你们赚几十万
I probably would've made you a couple hundred thousand...

607
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,770
你给我听着  小子  听好了
You listen to me, boy! You listen to me!

608
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,100
我佩服你的坚持
I admire your tenacity,

609
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:25,810
但你少跟我说你这是在帮我忙
but I draw the line at you claiming that you did me a favor.

610
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,600
别搞砸了
Don't screw this up.

611
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,920
在德州  你拿别人的生计冒险
'Cause in Texas, you put a man's livelihood on the line

612
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,860
然后又半途而废
and you don't follow through,

613
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,350
那就别再琢磨找新工作了
there's not gonna be another new job

614
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,980
因为到时都没人能找到你的尸体埋在哪
'cause ain't nobody gonna be able to find where you're buried.

615
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,210
有什么话想说吗  戈登
You've got something to say, Gordon?

616
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:47,380
没有  先生
No. No, sir.

617
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,220
我们去哪再找个工程师来
Where are we gonna find this new engineer?

618
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,940
来不及了  IBM的律师团明天一早就到
We needed him yesterday. IBM legal's here first thing tomorrow.

619
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,170
-我需要时间审查候选人  -没时间了
- I need time to vet a candidate. - We don't have time.

620
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,100
你觉得IBM现在正闲着吗
You think IBM is just sitting around on their asses?

621
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,300
我们现在有谁
Who do we have right now, huh?

622
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,180
现在有什么人吗
Who do we have right now?

623
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,250
下一局了
Next game.

624
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,220
搞什么啊  你都打了一个多小时了
What the hell? You've been on for over an hour.

625
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,370
别碰我
Get your hands off me, man.

626
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,720
我们接到投诉了
We're getting complaints.

627
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,800
难以置信  你给我滚
Unbelievable. You're gone.

628
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,200
滚
Go!

629
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,440
回见了  鬼婆娘
Later, spooky bitch.

630
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:56,850
你说什么
What?

631
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,310
够了
That's enough!

632
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,860
放我下来
Put me down!

633
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,840
-滚开  -放开我
- Come on! - Let go of me!

634
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,490
法西斯
Fascist!

635
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,460
天呐
Oh, Jesus.

636
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,770
不是吧
No.

637
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,230
怎么了
What?

638
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,970
这下可好
Great.

639
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,380
你知道我上过他吧
You know I screwed him, right?

640
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,490
我们都成熟点对待这事吧
Let's be adult about this.

641
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,420
你就喜欢对我居高临下  是吧
You love talking down to me, don't you?

642
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,540
我们还有几千个其他的选择
Look, there are a thousand other engineers we can get.

643
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,060
最好是找个你没睡过的
Preferably one you haven't bedded down with.

644
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,780
你是谁来着
Who are you again?

645
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,500
我是四天内就破解了引导程序的人
I'm the guy who figured out the boot code in four days.

646
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,300
你有什么本事
What have you done?

647
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,910
你听到了  我们有几千个其他选择
You heard him... A thousand other engineers.

648
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,410
不
No.

649
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,290
你肯定需要我  否则你也不会来找我了
You need me, otherwise you wouldn't be here.

650
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,950
你想要什么
What do you want?

651
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,180
我要你拿着你的机会
I want you to go dangle your little opportunity

652
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,330
去别人面前晃
in someone else's face.

653
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,600
那你怎么还没走
Then why are you still here?

654
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,110
我想看看我当初的错误判断
I wanted to see what I was so wrong about the first time.

655
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,730
我对那事很后悔
I regret that happened.

656
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,200
很抱歉你对伤害我的感情感到难过
I'm sorry you feel bad for hurting my feelings,

657
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:16,530
但别担心  你没伤着什么
but don't worry, you didn't.

658
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:19,150
本来不该走到那一步的  我是在物色人才
It wasn't supposed to be personal. I was scouting you.

659
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,980
就为了这个机会
Scouting you for this exact moment.

660
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,090
别  等等
No, wait.

661
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:28,530
这事太重要  不能有差错
This is too important to get wrong.

662
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,170
有点分量的人都不在意  不是吗
"No one who matters pays attention," Right?

663
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,580
别推销了
Okay, stop selling me.

664
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:32,700
我不需要你
I don't need you.

665
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,030
你觉得我不明白吗
You think I don't see it?

666
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,550
如果成功  我能飞黄腾达
This takes off, I write my own ticket,

667
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:39,710
但如果出了岔子  我就成了大学辍学生
but if it goes wrong, I'm a college dropout

668
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,160
修录像机每小时才挣3块25分
repairing VCRs for $3.25 an hour,

669
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,790
抱歉了  我得权衡一下
so forgive me for weighing my options.

670
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,650
瞧
See?

671
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,250
这么想才成熟
Now you're thinking like a professional.

672
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,370
你能给我多少钱
How much money would you give me?

673
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,210
初级工程师  毫无经验  两万
Junior engineer, no experience... 20 grand.

674
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,950
两倍
Double it.

675
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:03,290
我老婆在德州仪器才挣一万五
My wife makes 15 at TI.

676
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,890
那我替她遗憾
Well, then I feel sorry for her.

677
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,380
行不行
So?

678
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:12,770
你怎么决定  乔
What's it gonna be, Joe?

679
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,750
请如实回答
Answer honestly.

680
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,090
这是要做法律记录的
This is for legal record.

681
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,130
如果回答不属实可能被控作伪证  明白吗
False answers put you at risk of perjury, you understand?

682
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:10,270
抱歉  你得回答"是"或"我知道"
I'm sorry, you have to answer "Yes" Or "I do."

683
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,140
是的  我知道
Oh, yes, I do.

684
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,140
你是否曾试图反汇编或拆析
Have you ever attempted to disassemble or deconstruct

685
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:22,370
国际商业机器  俗称IBM的
any product manufactured by International Business Machines,

686

登上你们划过的

697
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:02,380

看来要做个人电脑光是入门

就得花上多达两百万以上

00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,970
理想的状态
rather than running from the bogeyman,

704
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:19,010
我们得定点规矩  一  别扯淡

但那样一来  你们也不能辞职
but that also means you can't leave,

710
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:36,130
所以我哪天要是心情不好
so if I need to stomp on one of y'all's heads

想拿你们撒气
to feel better about my morning shave,

712

你们就只能忍着了

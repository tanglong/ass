	乔·麦克米伦是什么时候来找你
	When did Joe MacMillan come to you with the idea
	逆向工程IBM个人电脑的
	to reverse engineer the IBM PC?
	这个陈述不太准确
	Um, that's factually incorrect.
	是约翰·博斯沃思和内森·卡迪夫于今年
	John Bosworth and Nathan Cardiff approached me
	about a new PC program on April 4th of this year.
	我理理清楚
	Let me get this straight.
	他们雇你克隆我们的BIOS代码
	You were hired to write a replica of our BIOS code,
	但你并不会看我们的BIOS代码
	but you won't be looking at our BIOS code.
	你看起来人不错
	You seem like a good kid.
	我们要的也不是你  所以你就...
	We're not here for you, so why don't you just...
	我不用看你们的BIOS代码
	Look, I don't need to look at your BIOS
	因为那种垃圾我也没兴趣抄
	because I'm not interested in copying garbage.
	当然  也许没有16位总线
	Sure, I might decide I want to spend the rest of my natural life
	我执行个指令得等上一辈子
	waiting to move an instruction without a 16-bit bus,
	除此之外  我才不会看你们的代码
	but other than that, I'm not looking at that binder.
	-那为什么找你呢  -什么意思
	- Then why you? - Excuse me?
	为什么找你
	Why you?
	你是大型机软件开发工程师
	You're a mainframe software engineer.
	你又不会搭建新东西
	You certainly don't build anything.
	克拉克先生无需解释为什么...
	Mr. Clark does not have to theorize as to why...
	我的微机经验比你们所有人都丰富
	I have more microcomputing experience than anyone here.
	我想问清楚
	Just so I understand,
	你是说你在此领域的失败经验
	you're saying that your past failures in this area
	却使你有资格领军卡迪夫的个人电脑项目吗
	somehow qualify you to spearhead the Cardiff PC program?
	你觉得他们要雇她多久
	What do you think they got her on for?
	-四周  五周  -直到她写完BIOS代码
	- Four, five, weeks? - However long it takes to finish the BIOS.
	我先说清楚  如果你真看代码簿了
	Just so we're clear, if you do decide to open this binder,
	你就是头一个进监狱的
	you'll be the first one that goes to jail.
	马上该你了
	You're up right now.
	这不对  这样不对
	That ain't right. It just ain't right.
	进去照着商量好的说就行了
	Just go in, stick to the script.
	你觉得那么容易吗
	You think this is easy?
	复述一堆谎话
	Parrot out a couple of outright lies,
	然后回家闷头大睡吗
	go home, sleep like a champ.
	你还嫩得很  孩子
	You got a lot to learn, son.
	你以为IBM没撒过谎吗
	You don't think IBM's ever lied?
	我不知道  我也不在乎
	I don't know. Don't care.
	你得明白
	Look, I need you to understand
	我的所作所为都是为大局考虑
	that I did what I did because it was right,
	不只为了我  还为了你和所有人
	not just for me, for you, for everybody.
	要是我上周来  客气地问你
	If I'd come in here a week ago and asked nicely,
	你早就大笑着把我轰出去了
	you'd have laughed me out of the room.
	我会一脚把你踢出去
	I'd have kicked your ass is what I woulda done.
	现在也没准
	And I still might.
	戴尔  没带律师吗
	Dale, no lawyers.
	何必
	Why?
	我知道你要说什么
	I know what you're gonna say.
	你把你的人教导的不错
	You've coached your team well.
	我们并没做出格的事
	All we did was stay inbounds.
	告诉波卡拉顿的小伙子们
	You tell the boys at Boca Raton
	{\pos(182.2,252)}位于福罗里达州  IBM个人电脑诞生地
	他们编的BIOS不错
	they've written a nice BIOS here.
	这会是场硬战
	It'll be tough to beat.
	但放心  我们的代码不会有侵权的部分
	But rest assured, ours will contain no copyrighted material,
	卡梅伦·豪伊会在一个完全隔绝的无扰室内工作
	Cameron Howe will be completely isolated in a clean room environment,
	不会与戈登·克拉克有任何接触
	she'll have no contact with Gordon Clark
	也不会接触他的逆向工程成品
	or his reverse-engineering work.
	代码中的相似之处将纯属巧合
	Any similarities in the code will be completely coincidental,
	就像哥伦比亚数据产品公司
	just like Columbia Data.
	{\an3}{\pos(380.2,252)}两家公司均通过逆向工程  发展出了不侵权的BIOS副本
	就像康柏电脑
	Just like Compaq.
	你和我一样清楚法律漏洞
	You know the legal loophole as well as I do.
	说实话  这我都不在乎
	Honestly, I don't care.
	我更想知道
	I'm more interested in
	这一年半你到底去哪了
	wherethe hell you've been the last year and a half.
	你不辞而别
	You left without saying good-bye.
	跟你的新朋友提起过那天吗
	Told any of your new friends about that day?
	你们合计得再天衣无缝又怎样
	Say all your ducks are in a row.
	我们还是可以照样告你
	Maybe we just sue you anyway.
	拿文山纸海连轴诉讼活埋了你
	Just bury you in paperwork and legal costs.
	你看见外面坐着的那人了吗
	You see that gentleman out there?
	他是我们的专职法律顾问  巴瑞·希尔斯
	That's our in-house counsel, Barry Shields.
	卡迪夫电子每年要付给他五万五
	He costs Cardiff Electric $55,000 a year,
	不管你请来多少天兵天将
	and no matter how many hundreds of lawyers you drop from the sky,
	我们只用巴瑞
	we're gonna stick with Barry.
	就他一人
	Just Barry.
	活活累死他
	We will ruin his life.
	就算真闹到法庭上  你也输定了
	And if this ever goes to trial, you'll lose...
	因为说到底  你什么把柄都没有
	'cause at the end of the day, you have nothing.
	一路顺风
	Have a nice flight.
	-我们没事了吧  -好极了
	- So, we're good? - We're perfect.
	我去写BIOS代码  然后呢
	So, hey, I write the BIOS code, then what?
	我们到底想造什么
	What exactly are we building?
	{\pos(273,80)}速度翻倍  价格减半
	这基本不可能
	That's physically impossible.
	这真的就是个物理方面的问题
	I mean, it's literally a physics problem.
	我糊涂了  全部目标就是这个
	I don't understand. This is seriously all we're building.
	你不明白  市场靠利润推动
	Look, you don't get it. The market moves by increments.
	下一款上市的电脑要么更快  要么更便宜
	The next machine that hits the shelves is either faster or cheaper.
	但是没法兼得
	It can't be both, you know.
	根本就不可能
	That's impossible. It's--
	你怎么想的  提高处理器主频还是...
	What are you talking about, pure megahertz here, or--
	没准我们可以
	or maybe we could--
	可以在硬件上下下功夫
	we could crank up the crystal
	或者从软件下手
	or attack at the software.
	乔  你的想法有意思  很有意思
	Joe, that's interesting. That's really interesting.
	慢着  什么  等等
	Wait, what? Back up!
	这根本什么都不是  陈词滥调啊
	This is nothing. This is boring.
	这就是割草机  或是微波炉
	This is a lawn mower or a microwave.
	看来你还是个空想主义者
	Let me guess, you're one of those idea people.
	你所谓的"空想"是指我知道
	If by "idea people," you mean I'm familiar
	没有在十年前就淘汰的古董技术吗
	with technology that wasn't obsolete a decade ago.
	你真的碰过电脑硬件吗
	Have you ever even touched a piece of hardware?
	你们这些自以为是的小屁孩都这毛病
	See, that's the problem with you entitled school kids.
	花花理论一套一套
	You've got a lot of fancy theories,
	但从没潜下心真正研究硬件
	but you've never actually been close to the metal.
	如果"纯理论"是不愿意
	If real theory is that I want to do something
	不管别人做什么
	a little bit more than two
	我们只管翻倍那么简单...
	times everything that everybody else is doing!
	电脑就该有照片级真实的显示器
	Computers should have photo-realistic screens.
	有百万像素  还能自主学习
	They should have a million pixels and be self-learning
	还能运行专家系统
	and run expert systems.
	能下棋赢过我
	They should beat me at chess.
	那超级电脑HAL是不是还该拥有情感
	And maybe HAL can have human emotions, too,
	{\pos(142.2,252)}出自《2001太空漫游》
	能在我们睡觉时开太空船
	and steer the ship while we're sleeping.
	那我们就只跟风造个米黄的盒子吗
	So we're just building another boring beige box?
	造什么都轮不着你
	You're not building anything, okay?
	-那是我的事  -你这话什么意思
	- I am. - What's that supposed to mean?
	你俩怎么还在一个房间里
	Hey, why are you two still in the same room?
	不行  现在起我们光明正大
	No, from here on in, we do this thing aboveboard,
	完全依照法律
	to the letter of the law.
	所以  你俩哪怕上厕所路上
	And that means you two don't so much as smile at each other
	打个照面笑一笑都不行
	on your way to the ladies' room.
	好啊  快把她带走
	Fine, get her out of here.
	黛比  你能照顾下这位小麻杆吗
	Debbie, can you deal with slim here?
	你们的工作内容究竟是什么
	So, what is it that y'all are doing for us again?
	写BIOS代码
	Writing BIOS code.
	意思是基本输入输出系统
	It's "Basic Input Output Software."
	你开电脑时就先启动这个系统
	It's what first runs when you turn the computer on.
	就像字星那样吗
	So, like WordStar?
	{\pos(188,252)}一种文字处理软件
	BIOS启动电脑
	So, BIOS boots the computer,
	让电脑可以加载操作系统
	which allows you to load the operating system
	然后才能运行字星
	and then you can run WordStar.
	然后我才能敲出一封情书吗
	So I can write a little love letter to my boyfriend?
	是这样吗
	That right?
	差不多吧
	Yeah, something like that.
	欢迎来到无扰室
	Welcome to the clean room.
	知道吗  桑格百货这周末买一送二
	You know, there'sa three-for-one at Sanger's all weekend.
	那儿的衣服挺不错的
	They got great stuff.
	你写代码时我得待在这儿...
	So, I have to stay here while you write the--
	一直在吗
	The entire time?
	是的  法律要求我在无扰室做记录
	Yeah, I'm legally required to keep the clean room log.
	不让你接触那位有问题的工程师
	Maintain the Chinese wall between you and that tainted engineer.
	好了
	Okay, hey.
	大家都听我说
	Listen up here, y'all. Hey!
	跟大家说点事
	I'm gonna catch up on a few things here.
	这是乔·麦克米伦
	All right, this here's Joe MacMillan.
	他是新的
	He is the new-- ahem--
	高级产品经理
	Senior Product Manager
	负责卡迪夫电子新成立的个人电脑部
	at Cardiff Electric's new Personal Computer Division.
	乔从IBM转投了我们  算是吧
	Yeah, Joe comes to us from IBM, sorta.
	别看他刚来不久
	He's only been with us a short while,
	却已经带来了不小的影响
	but he's already made quite an impact.
	-乔  要不要...  -谢谢  约翰
	- Joe, you wanna-- - Oh, thanks, John.
	我必须要说
	And I'd be remiss if I didn't say
	全靠你的信念  远见
	that it wasn't your faith, your foresight,
	还有  恕我说话粗
	and, if you'll excuse me,
	你有种才能走到今天
	your brass balls that got us here.
	多亏你对这个项目的支持
	By moving forward with this endeavor,
	卡迪夫电子将
	you have helped establish Cardiff Electric
	成为业界先驱  迈入21世纪
	as an industry trailblazer well into the 21st century.
	为约翰鼓鼓掌吧
	A round of applause for John.
	这一周里你们可能听到些传言
	Now, you may have heard some rumors over this last week.
	看到了些蓝西装的陌生人
	Perhaps you saw some unfamiliar blue suits in the building,
	跟我一样听到了传言
	heard the same whispers I did.
	"马上要有动作了"
	"Change is about to come down."
	我今天来告诉你们  传言是真的
	Well, I'm here today to tell you that those rumors were true.
	卡迪夫电子是要有动作了
	Change is coming to Cardiff,
	我非常荣幸地告诉大家
	and I'm pleased to announce that each and every one of you
	公司将锦绣前程  而且大家都有份
	will have a role to play in this company's bright future.
	告诉大家  个人电脑部只有两条规矩
	Now, I've only got two rules for our new PC division.
	一  大家尽情找乐子
	One, let's have a lot of fun.
	二
	And, two...
	大家一起赚大钱  好吗
	let's make a lot of money, right?
	如果两条都做到了
	And if we get one and two right,
	也许可以改变大家工作的方式
	well, we just might change the way people work,
	生活的方式
	the way people live,
	与人互动的方式
	and how they interact with each other.
	也许还能在宇宙中留下印记
	We just might put a ding in the universe, right?
	你叫什么
	Hey, what's your name?
	-塔拉  -塔拉  你好
	- Tara. - Tara, so good to meet you.
	-那个  -戈登  能说句话吗
	- You know-- - Gordon, hi, can I just borrow you for a second?
	-就一下  -好吧
	- Just one second. - Yeah, sure.
	好了  你在这儿
	Here we are. This is you.
	看看谁升职了呢
	Look who's moving up in the world.
	窗子什么的全有了
	Now you got a window and everything.
	乔布斯  "宇宙里留下印记"
	Jobs, "Ding in the universe."
	史蒂夫·乔布斯  苹果的总裁
	Steve Jobs, the guy who runs Apple,
	几年前说的
	he said that a few years ago.
	我知道  说得多好啊
	Yeah, I know. Isn't it great?
	回家吧  好好睡一觉
	You should go home, get a good night's sleep.
	明天很重要
	You've got a big day tomorrow.
	为什么
	Why?
	明天你要开始构筑未来
	Well, tomorrow you start building tomorrow.

	这是你点的吧
	I'm guessing this is you.
	太棒了
	Oh, awesome.
	谢了  他会付钱的
	Thanks. He'll pay for it.
	想告诉我你在干什么吗
	Do you wanna tell me what you're doing?
	给台没人会在乎的机子写BIOS
	Uh, writing BIOS for a machine no one's gonna give a shit about.
	没错  没错
	You're right. You're right.
	谁在乎这台机子呢
	Who cares about the machine?
	重要的是将来使用它的人
	What really matters are the people who will use it.
	如果降低成本  就降低了入行门槛
	If we lower the cost, we lower their barrier to entry,
	而速度加倍  则效率也加倍
	and by doubling the speed, we allow them to do twice as much.
	这样就相当于使用我们电脑的人
	So, now we've got twice as many people
	翻了一番  使用时间长了一倍
	using our computer for twice as long.
	你对着镜子练过这段吗
	You practice that in a mirror?
	我觉得你根本不珍惜
	Look, I don't think you appreciate
	我们现在的机会
	the opportunity we have here to--
	我都听到了
	Mm-mmm, I heard all about it.
	"找乐子  赚大钱"  还有些别的废话
	"Have fun, make money." And then a whole bunch of other shit
	要么是你编的  要么就是剽窃的
	that you either made up entirely or stole from someone else.
	你不过就是个推销员
	You're just a salesman.
	怎么样
	So?
	我觉得  我不敢肯定
	I think-- I'm not positive,
	但我有充分理由相信
	but I have good reason to believe that...
	我们不会有事的
	we're gonna be okay.
	-那IBM和...  -走了
	- So, IBM and-- - Gone.
	乔是对的  我们把他们赶走了
	Joe was right. We played 'em right out the door.
	-那你打算...  -我明天开始
	- So you're gonna get to-- - I start tomorrow...
	还有了新办公室
	in my new office.
	还有窗子什么的
	Window and everything.
	看看你  大人物
	Oh, look at you, big shot.
	-孩子们在哪  -他们在隔壁玩  在...
	- Where are the kids? - They're playing next door at the--
	等等
	Hang on.
	我想把...
	I'm trying to--
	-去卧室吧  -好
	- Let's go to the bedroom. - Okay.
	我明天得带琼妮去看牙医
	I have to take Joanie to the dentist tomorrow.
	他们可能得拔一颗牙
	They might have to pull a tooth.
	你该顺道来趟卡迪夫
	You should stop by Cardiff.
	我得送她回学校
	I'm gonna have to take her back to school.
	得啦  我知道她讨厌牙医
	Oh, come on. I know she hates the dentist.
	也许完事后顺道来看爸爸算是个安慰呢
	Maybe it'll be a treat to stop by and see her daddy afterwards.
	再说  你可以看看我的新办公室
	Besides, you can see my new office.
	对了  你找了谁
	Who'd you get, by the way?
	写BIOS的人
	To write the BIOS?
	麦克米伦肯定准备好了人选
	I bet MacMillan had some guy all lined up, right?
	确实是
	He did, yeah.
	-是谁  -卡梅伦·豪伊
	- Who? - Cameron Howe.
	他什么来路
	What's his background?
	好像是奥斯汀科技
	Austin Tech, I think.
	如果你也认同  他肯定挺厉害
	Well, he must be the real deal if you're on board.
	是啊
	Yeah.
	总之  我把蓝色巨人的那些混蛋赶走了
	Anyway, I chased them blue bastards out of town, I tell you what.
	你能相信吗  野马队没有败绩
	Can you imagine the 'stangs go undefeated
	还是没进去佐治亚的比赛
	and still miss out on Georgia?
	想想看  迪科森去打糖缸杯Can you imagine Dickerson in the Sugar Bowl?
	{\pos(250,252)}年度美国大学橄榄球大型比赛
	他肯定打得他们屁滚尿流
	Oh, he woulda run all over them dogs, huh?
	不过麦基埃尼的臂力还是很强
	McIlhenny still got a good arm on him, though.
	我敢说他今年要是投个十来次
	I tell ya, I bet he throws for 1,000 yards this year
	能投出一千码
	if he throws for a dozen.
	是啊
	Yeah.
	让人有点跃跃欲试  是不是  卡尔
	Makes you want to suit up. Doesn't it, Carl?
	你当年也是个狠角色
	You were a pretty damn good player in your day, you know?
	你今年还打算投资
	So you think you're gonna kick into
	球员招募基金吗
	the player recruitment fund this year?
	我打算秋天大投一笔
	I think I'm gonna kick in big in the fall.
	不确定
	Mm, not sure yet.
	卡尔
	Hey, Carl?
	我们的系统你们用的怎么样
	Hey, how we doing system-wise over at your place?
	你知道我要干什么吗
	Know what I'm gonna do?
	我打算派几个人过去给你升个级
	I'm gonna send over a couple boys with some upgrades,
	确保系统运行万无一失
	just, y'know, to make sure everything's running top-notch.
	怎么样
	How about that?
	完全免费
	You know? No invoices. Huh-uh. No.
	就是出于友谊
	Just a favor between two 'stangs.
	真好
	Great.
	{\pos(113,165)}如果你识字  我走了
	她人呢

	不知道
	I have no idea.
	她倒是挺有意思的
	She's kind of interesting, though, you know?
	总穿着迷彩服
	Wears those army clothes.
	你出去透透气吧
	Why don't you get some air?
	以后我来应付她
	I'll deal with her from now on.
	我得做无扰室记录
	I gotta maintain the clean room log.
	巴瑞  你脸上画着蛋蛋呢
	Barry, you've got balls on your face.
	什么
	What?
	-她就交给我了  -我的脸怎么了
	- I'll handle it from here. - I got what?
	你好像认为你可以在这儿为所欲为
	It occurs to me that you think you can do whatever you want here.
	这儿不是你的游乐场
	This isn't your playground,
	而且你想错了
	and contrary to what you might think,
	我见过代码  不太像你正在写的东西
	I know what code looks like, and this certainly isn't code.
	没错
	You're right.
	你说对了
	No, you're right.
	这不是代码
	Yeah, this isn't code.
	你也看到了
	As you can tell.
	我在考虑为了对齐八进制边界
	I'm trying to decide if we need to do this multiplication
	是否需要进行乘法运算
	in order to align on octal boundaries.
	我认为  相信你也会同意
	Now, my gut says, and I'm sure you'd agree,
	如果将将二进制数左移三位
	that we can do a shift-left-together three-bit-zero
	右侧补零  不仅更快
	fill to the right, which is faster
	而且与英特尔80186中的累加器效果相当
	and gives the same result on the accumulator on the 186,
	不过我也不确定
	but... I don't know,
	你的意见如何呢
	I'd love to hear your thoughts.
	你想不出来了
	You're stuck.
	你知不知道你想干什么
	Do you even know what you're trying to do?
	好像你就知道似的
	What, like you'd know?
	让我想想
	Give me a minute.
	也许我能帮忙
	Maybe I could help.
	好啊
	All right.
	你干嘛
	What are you doing?
	我现在不想再思考这个了
	I don't want to think about this anymore.
	我需要放空头脑
	I need to clear my mind.
	那就休息一下
	Then take a break.
	比如跟黛比和其他员工一起去喝个汽水吗
	Like, we can get a soda with Debbie and the rest of the 700 Club?
	我和他们不一样
	I'm not them.
	你得上楼去  乖乖守着你的终端
	You need to go upstairs, get back to your terminal.
	那我们到底要不要做这个
	So, are we gonna do this, or what?
	卡迪夫电子  请问您找哪位
	Cardiff Electric, how may I direct your call?
	请稍等
	Please hold.
	我得再重申一遍我们完全不了解那个女孩
	I'll state for the record again that we know nothing about that girl
	也不知道她会做出什么事来
	or what she's capable of.
	没错  等她写完BIOS代码
	You're right. Once she writes the BIOS code,
	就让她走人
	we should cut her loose.
	什么意思
	What do you mean?
	等她完成BIOS代码
	As soon as she finishes the BIOS code,
	就不再有法律威胁  也就不需要她了
	there's no more legal threat, we don't need her anymore.
	哦  好吧  好的
	Oh, well, okay, yeah. Yeah, good.
	解脱了  我完全理解
	Good riddance. Makes perfect sense to me, but
	但眼下我们得让她留在无扰室
	right now we need her in the clean room.
	那就下楼去和她说
	Then you go down and talk to her.
	我都不能和她待在一个楼层
	I'm not even supposed to be on the same floor as her.
	她要是没在桌边敲键盘的话
	Look, if she's not at her desk inputting keystrokes,
	就没在写BIOS代码
	then she's not writing BIOS code, okay?
	我们要让她写BIOS代码
	We need her writing BIOS code.
	好吧
	Okay.

	IBM知道你会看的

	稍稍改动你的BIOS  避开麻烦

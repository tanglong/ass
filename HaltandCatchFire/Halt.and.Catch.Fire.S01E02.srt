1
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,260
乔·麦克米伦是什么时候来找你
When did Joe MacMillan come to you with the idea

2
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,650
逆向工程IBM个人电脑的
to reverse engineer the IBM PC?

3
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,940
这个陈述不太准确
Um, that's factually incorrect.

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,330
是约翰·博斯沃思和内森·卡迪夫于今年
John Bosworth and Nathan Cardiff approached me

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,090
4月4日来找我商讨新个人电脑项目的事
about a new PC program on April 4th of this year.

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,910
我理理清楚
Let me get this straight.

7
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,420
他们雇你克隆我们的BIOS代码
You were hired to write a replica of our BIOS code,

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,500
但你并不会看我们的BIOS代码
but you won't be looking at our BIOS code.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,770
你看起来人不错
You seem like a good kid.

10
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,320
我们要的也不是你  所以你就...
We're not here for you, so why don't you just...

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,390
我不用看你们的BIOS代码
Look, I don't need to look at your BIOS

12
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,830
因为那种垃圾我也没兴趣抄
because I'm not interested in copying garbage.

13
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,480
当然  也许没有16位总线
Sure, I might decide I want to spend the rest of my natural life

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,660
我执行个指令得等上一辈子
waiting to move an instruction without a 16-bit bus,

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,950
除此之外  我才不会看你们的代码
but other than that, I'm not looking at that binder.

16
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,580
-那为什么找你呢  -什么意思
- Then why you? - Excuse me?

17
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,590
为什么找你
Why you?

18
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,560
你是大型机软件开发工程师
You're a mainframe software engineer.

19
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,310
你又不会搭建新东西
You certainly don't build anything.

20
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,630
克拉克先生无需解释为什么...
Mr. Clark does not have to theorize as to why...

21
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,300
我的微机经验比你们所有人都丰富
I have more microcomputing experience than anyone here.

22
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,690
我想问清楚
Just so I understand,

23
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,270
你是说你在此领域的失败经验
you're saying that your past failures in this area

24
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,410
却使你有资格领军卡迪夫的个人电脑项目吗
somehow qualify you to spearhead the Cardiff PC program?

25
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,440
你觉得他们要雇她多久
What do you think they got her on for?

26
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,920
-四周  五周  -直到她写完BIOS代码
- Four, five, weeks? - However long it takes to finish the BIOS.

27
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,560
我先说清楚  如果你真看代码簿了
Just so we're clear, if you do decide to open this binder,

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,250
你就是头一个进监狱的
you'll be the first one that goes to jail.

29
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,460
马上该你了
You're up right now.

30
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,580
这不对  这样不对
That ain't right. It just ain't right.

31
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,020
进去照着商量好的说就行了
Just go in, stick to the script.

32
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,520
你觉得那么容易吗
You think this is easy?

33
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,220
复述一堆谎话
Parrot out a couple of outright lies,

34
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,310
然后回家闷头大睡吗
go home, sleep like a champ.

35
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,350
你还嫩得很  孩子
You got a lot to learn, son.

36
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,780
你以为IBM没撒过谎吗
You don't think IBM's ever lied?

37
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,850
我不知道  我也不在乎
I don't know. Don't care.

38
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,860
你得明白
Look, I need you to understand

39
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,380
我的所作所为都是为大局考虑
that I did what I did because it was right,

40
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,370
不只为了我  还为了你和所有人
not just for me, for you, for everybody.

41
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,360
要是我上周来  客气地问你
If I'd come in here a week ago and asked nicely,

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,630
你早就大笑着把我轰出去了
you'd have laughed me out of the room.

43
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,000
我会一脚把你踢出去
I'd have kicked your ass is what I woulda done.

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,780
现在也没准
And I still might.

45
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,190
戴尔  没带律师吗
Dale, no lawyers.

46
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,170
何必
Why?

47
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,330
我知道你要说什么
I know what you're gonna say.

48
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,320
你把你的人教导的不错
You've coached your team well.

49
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,460
我们并没做出格的事
All we did was stay inbounds.

50
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,510
告诉波卡拉顿的小伙子们
You tell the boys at Boca Raton

51
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,510
{\pos(182.2,252)}位于福罗里达州  IBM个人电脑诞生地

52
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,070
他们编的BIOS不错
they've written a nice BIOS here.

53
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,340
这会是场硬战
It'll be tough to beat.

54
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,440
但放心  我们的代码不会有侵权的部分
But rest assured, ours will contain no copyrighted material,

55
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,510
卡梅伦·豪伊会在一个完全隔绝的无扰室内工作
Cameron Howe will be completely isolated in a clean room environment,

56
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,320
不会与戈登·克拉克有任何接触
she'll have no contact with Gordon Clark

57
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,980
也不会接触他的逆向工程成品
or his reverse-engineering work.

58
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,210
代码中的相似之处将纯属巧合
Any similarities in the code will be completely coincidental,

59
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,730
就像哥伦比亚数据产品公司
just like Columbia Data.

60
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,820
{\an3}{\pos(380.2,252)}两家公司均通过逆向工程  发展出了不侵权的BIOS副本

就像康柏电脑
Just like Compaq.

62
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,150
你和我一样清楚法律漏洞
You know the legal loophole as well as I do.

63
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,010
说实话  这我都不在乎
Honestly, I don't care.

64
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:47,960
我更想知道
I'm more interested in 

65
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,090
这一年半你到底去哪了
wherethe hell you've been the last year and a half.

66
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,880
你不辞而别
You left without saying good-bye.

67
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,030
跟你的新朋友提起过那天吗
Told any of your new friends about that day?

68
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,710
你们合计得再天衣无缝又怎样
Say all your ducks are in a row.

69
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,500
我们还是可以照样告你
Maybe we just sue you anyway.

70
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,630
拿文山纸海连轴诉讼活埋了你
Just bury you in paperwork and legal costs.

71
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,050
你看见外面坐着的那人了吗
You see that gentleman out there?

72
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,690
他是我们的专职法律顾问  巴瑞·希尔斯
That's our in-house counsel, Barry Shields.

73
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,070
卡迪夫电子每年要付给他五万五
He costs Cardiff Electric $55,000 a year,

74
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,160
不管你请来多少天兵天将
and no matter how many hundreds of lawyers you drop from the sky,

75
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,630
我们只用巴瑞
we're gonna stick with Barry.

76
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,090
就他一人
Just Barry.

77
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,210
活活累死他
We will ruin his life.

78
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,880
就算真闹到法庭上  你也输定了
And if this ever goes to trial, you'll lose...

79
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,210
因为说到底  你什么把柄都没有
'cause at the end of the day, you have nothing.

80
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,140
一路顺风

- So, we're good? - We're perfect.

我去写BIOS代码  然后呢
So, hey, I write the BIOS code, then what?

83
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,590

这基本不可能
That's physically impossible.

86
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,330
这真的就是个物理方面的问题
I mean, it's literally a physics problem.

87
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,200
我糊涂了  全部目标就是这个
I don't understand. This is seriously all we're building.

88
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,640
你不明白  市场靠利润推动
Look, you don't get it. The market moves by increments.

89
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,340
下一款上市的电脑要么更快  要么更便宜
The next machine that hits the shelves is either faster or cheaper.

90
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,110
但是没法兼得
It can't be both, you know.

91
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,870
根本就不可能
That's impossible. It's--

你怎么想的  提高处理器主频还是...
What are you talking about, pure megahertz here, or--

93
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,540
没准我们可以
or maybe we could--

94
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,690
可以在硬件上下下功夫
we could crank up the crystal

95
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,680
或者从软件下手
or attack at the software.

96
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,650
乔  你的想法有意思  很有意思
Joe, that's interesting. That's really interesting.

00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,970
慢着  什么  等等
Wait, what? Back up!

98
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,320
这根本什么都不是  陈词滥调啊
This is nothing. This is boring.

99
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,100
这就是割草机  或是微波炉
This is a lawn mower or a microwave.

看来你还是个空想主义者
Let me guess, you're one of those idea people.

101
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,950
你所谓的"空想"是指我知道
If by "idea people," you mean I'm familiar

102
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,560
没有在十年前就淘汰的古董技术吗
with technology that wasn't obsolete a decade ago.

103
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,320
你真的碰过电脑硬件吗
Have you ever even touched a piece of hardware?

104
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,150
你们这些自以为是的小屁孩都这毛病
See, that's the problem with you entitled school kids.

105
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,560
花花理论一套一套
You've got a lot of fancy theories,

106
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,030
但从没潜下心真正研究硬件
but you've never actually been close to the metal.

107
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,610
如果"纯理论"是不愿意
If real theory is that I want to do something

Computers should have photo-realistic screens.

They should have a million pixels and be self-learning

然后才能运行字星
and then you can run WordStar.

136
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,480
然后我才能敲出一封情书吗
So I can write a little love letter to my boyfriend?

137
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,510
是这样吗
That right?

138
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,590
差不多吧
Yeah, something like that.

139
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,550
欢迎来到无扰室
Welcome to the clean room.

140
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,080
知道吗  桑格百货这周末买一送二
You know, there'sa three-for-one at Sanger's all weekend.

141
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,570
那儿的衣服挺不错的
They got great stuff.

142
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,580
你写代码时我得待在这儿...
So, I have to stay here while you write the--

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,160
一直在吗
The entire time?

144
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,800
是的  法律要求我在无扰室做记录
Yeah, I'm legally required to keep the clean room log.

145
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,710
不让你接触那位有问题的工程师
Maintain the Chinese wall between you and that tainted engineer.

146
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,520
好了
Okay, hey.

147
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,180
大家都听我说
Listen up here, y'all. Hey!

148
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,040
跟大家说点事
I'm gonna catch up on a few things here.

149
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,790
这是乔·麦克米伦
All right, this here's Joe MacMillan.

150
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,020
他是新的
He is the new-- ahem--

151
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,940
高级产品经理
Senior Product Manager

152
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,530
负责卡迪夫电子新成立的个人电脑部
at Cardiff Electric's new Personal Computer Division.

153
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,100
乔从IBM转投了我们  算是吧
Yeah, Joe comes to us from IBM, sorta.

154
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,660
别看他刚来不久
He's only been with us a short while,

155
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,680
却已经带来了不小的影响
but he's already made quite an impact.

156
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,730
-乔  要不要...  -谢谢  约翰
- Joe, you wanna-- - Oh, thanks, John.

157
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,320
我必须要说
And I'd be remiss if I didn't say

158
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,530
全靠你的信念  远见
that it wasn't your faith, your foresight,

159
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,960
还有  恕我说话粗
and, if you'll excuse me,

160
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,850
你有种才能走到今天
your brass balls that got us here.

161
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,120
多亏你对这个项目的支持
By moving forward with this endeavor,

162
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,990
卡迪夫电子将
you have helped establish Cardiff Electric

163
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,280
成为业界先驱  迈入21世纪
as an industry trailblazer well into the 21st century.

164
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,800
为约翰鼓鼓掌吧
A round of applause for John.

165
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,970
这一周里你们可能听到些传言
Now, you may have heard some rumors over this last week.

166
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,950
看到了些蓝西装的陌生人
Perhaps you saw some unfamiliar blue suits in the building,

167
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,840
跟我一样听到了传言
heard the same whispers I did.

168
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,620
"马上要有动作了"
"Change is about to come down."

169
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,230
我今天来告诉你们  传言是真的
Well, I'm here today to tell you that those rumors were true.

170
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,040
卡迪夫电子是要有动作了
Change is coming to Cardiff,

171
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,620
我非常荣幸地告诉大家
and I'm pleased to announce that each and every one of you

172
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,910
公司将锦绣前程  而且大家都有份
will have a role to play in this company's bright future.

173
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,090
告诉大家  个人电脑部只有两条规矩
Now, I've only got two rules for our new PC division.

174
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,900
一  大家尽情找乐子
One, let's have a lot of fun.

175
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,130
二
And, two...

176
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,520
大家一起赚大钱  好吗
let's make a lot of money, right?

177
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,560
如果两条都做到了
And if we get one and two right,

178
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,150
也许可以改变大家工作的方式
well, we just might change the way people work,

179
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,590
生活的方式
the way people live,

180
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,770
与人互动的方式
and how they interact with each other.

181
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,060
也许还能在宇宙中留下印记
We just might put a ding in the universe, right?

182
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,750
你叫什么
Hey, what's your name?

183
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,950
-塔拉  -塔拉  你好
- Tara. - Tara, so good to meet you.

184
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,450
-那个  -戈登  能说句话吗
- You know-- - Gordon, hi, can I just borrow you for a second?

185
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,410
-就一下  -好吧
- Just one second. - Yeah, sure.

186
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,020
好了  你在这儿
Here we are. This is you.

187
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,510
看看谁升职了呢
Look who's moving up in the world.

188
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,190
窗子什么的全有了
Now you got a window and everything.

189
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,200
乔布斯  "宇宙里留下印记"
Jobs, "Ding in the universe."

190
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,510
史蒂夫·乔布斯  苹果的总裁
Steve Jobs, the guy who runs Apple,

191
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,840
几年前说的
he said that a few years ago.

192
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,550
我知道  说得多好啊
Yeah, I know. Isn't it great?

193
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,730
回家吧  好好睡一觉
You should go home, get a good night's sleep.

194
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,180
明天很重要
You've got a big day tomorrow.

195
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,220
为什么
Why?

196
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,870
明天你要开始构筑未来
Well, tomorrow you start building tomorrow.

197
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:25,840
*利多好想念  离家的小船*
*Lido missed the boat that day he left the shack*

198
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:32,620
*时间刚刚够  赌赌老虎机*
*Just long enough to grab a handle off the top*

199
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,090
*下站去芝城*
*Next stop Chi-town*

200
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,550
*利多放下钱  图案轮轮转*
*Lido put the money down and let it roll*

201
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,970
*再干一份活  他说刚刚够*
*He said one more job oughta get it*

202
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,600
*最后来一发  便金盆洗手*
*One last shot 'fore we quit it*

203
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,200
*一票抵路费*
*One for the roa..*

204
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,320
她说有助思考
She says it helps her think.

205
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,540
这是你点的吧
I'm guessing this is you.

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,280
太棒了
Oh, awesome.

207
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,240
谢了  他会付钱的
Thanks. He'll pay for it.

208
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,290
想告诉我你在干什么吗
Do you wanna tell me what you're doing?

209
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,330
给台没人会在乎的机子写BIOS
Uh, writing BIOS for a machine no one's gonna give a shit about.

210
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,620
没错  没错
You're right. You're right.

211
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,530
谁在乎这台机子呢
Who cares about the machine?

212
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,800
重要的是将来使用它的人
What really matters are the people who will use it.

213
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,180
如果降低成本  就降低了入行门槛
If we lower the cost, we lower their barrier to entry,

214
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,360
而速度加倍  则效率也加倍
and by doubling the speed, we allow them to do twice as much.

215
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,360
这样就相当于使用我们电脑的人
So, now we've got twice as many people

216
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,600
翻了一番  使用时间长了一倍
using our computer for twice as long.

217
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,370
你对着镜子练过这段吗
You practice that in a mirror?

218
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,950
我觉得你根本不珍惜
Look, I don't think you appreciate

219
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,240
我们现在的机会
the opportunity we have here to--

220
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,720
我都听到了
Mm-mmm, I heard all about it.

221
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,160
"找乐子  赚大钱"  还有些别的废话
"Have fun, make money." And then a whole bunch of other shit

222
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,890
要么是你编的  要么就是剽窃的
that you either made up entirely or stole from someone else.

223
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,440
你不过就是个推销员
You're just a salesman.

224
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,360
怎么样
So?

225
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,850
我觉得  我不敢肯定
I think-- I'm not positive,

226
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,940
但我有充分理由相信
but I have good reason to believe that...

227
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,990
我们不会有事的
we're gonna be okay.

228
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,460
-那IBM和...  -走了
- So, IBM and-- - Gone.

229
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,200
乔是对的  我们把他们赶走了
Joe was right. We played 'em right out the door.

230
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,500
-那你打算...  -我明天开始
- So you're gonna get to-- - I start tomorrow...

231
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,580
还有了新办公室
in my new office.

232
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,320
还有窗子什么的
Window and everything.

233
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,310
看看你  大人物
Oh, look at you, big shot.

234
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,990
-孩子们在哪  -他们在隔壁玩  在...
- Where are the kids? - They're playing next door at the--

235
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,050
等等
Hang on.

236
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,590
我想把...
I'm trying to--

237
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,730
-去卧室吧  -好
- Let's go to the bedroom. - Okay.

238
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,820
我明天得带琼妮去看牙医
I have to take Joanie to the dentist tomorrow.

239
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
他们可能得拔一颗牙
They might have to pull a tooth.

240
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,060
你该顺道来趟卡迪夫
You should stop by Cardiff.

241
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,080
我得送她回学校
I'm gonna have to take her back to school.

242
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,870
得啦  我知道她讨厌牙医
Oh, come on. I know she hates the dentist.

243
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,200
也许完事后顺道来看爸爸算是个安慰呢
Maybe it'll be a treat to stop by and see her daddy afterwards.

244
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,310
再说  你可以看看我的新办公室
Besides, you can see my new office.

245
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,360
对了  你找了谁
Who'd you get, by the way?

246
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,140
写BIOS的人
To write the BIOS?

247
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,850
麦克米伦肯定准备好了人选
I bet MacMillan had some guy all lined up, right?

248
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,980
确实是
He did, yeah.

249
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,630
-是谁  -卡梅伦·豪伊
- Who? - Cameron Howe.

250
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,600
他什么来路
What's his background?

251
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,620
好像是奥斯汀科技
Austin Tech, I think.

252
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,350
如果你也认同  他肯定挺厉害
Well, he must be the real deal if you're on board.

253
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,030
是啊
Yeah.

254
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,060
总之  我把蓝色巨人的那些混蛋赶走了
Anyway, I chased them blue bastards out of town, I tell you what.

255
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,800
你能相信吗  野马队没有败绩
Can you imagine the 'stangs go undefeated

256
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,490
还是没进去佐治亚的比赛
and still miss out on Georgia?

257
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,480
想想看  迪科森去打糖缸杯Can you imagine Dickerson in the Sugar Bowl?

258
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,480
{\pos(250,252)}年度美国大学橄榄球大型比赛

259
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,690
他肯定打得他们屁滚尿流
Oh, he woulda run all over them dogs, huh?

260
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,610
不过麦基埃尼的臂力还是很强
McIlhenny still got a good arm on him, though.

261
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,260
我敢说他今年要是投个十来次
I tell ya, I bet he throws for 1,000 yards this year

262
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,750
能投出一千码
if he throws for a dozen.

263
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,360
是啊
Yeah.

264
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,770
让人有点跃跃欲试  是不是  卡尔
Makes you want to suit up. Doesn't it, Carl?

265
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,710
你当年也是个狠角色
You were a pretty damn good player in your day, you know?

266
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,550
你今年还打算投资
So you think you're gonna kick into

267
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,470
球员招募基金吗
the player recruitment fund this year?

268
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,600
我打算秋天大投一笔
I think I'm gonna kick in big in the fall.

269
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,280
不确定
Mm, not sure yet.

270
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,580
卡尔
Hey, Carl?

271
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,220
我们的系统你们用的怎么样
Hey, how we doing system-wise over at your place?

272
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,810
你知道我要干什么吗
Know what I'm gonna do?

273
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,960
我打算派几个人过去给你升个级
I'm gonna send over a couple boys with some upgrades,

274
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,780
确保系统运行万无一失
just, y'know, to make sure everything's running top-notch. 

275
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,860
怎么样
How about that?

276
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,100
完全免费
You know? No invoices. Huh-uh. No.

277
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,410
就是出于友谊
Just a favor between two 'stangs.

278
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:33,920
真好
Great.

279
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,880
{\pos(113,165)}如果你识字  我走了

280
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,680
她人呢
Where is she?

281
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,760
不知道
I have no idea.

282
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,200
她倒是挺有意思的
She's kind of interesting, though, you know?

283
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,410
总穿着迷彩服
Wears those army clothes.

284
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,950
你出去透透气吧
Why don't you get some air?

285
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,040
以后我来应付她
I'll deal with her from now on.

286
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,580
我得做无扰室记录
I gotta maintain the clean room log.

287
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,120
巴瑞  你脸上画着蛋蛋呢
Barry, you've got balls on your face.

288
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,010
什么
What?

289
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,420
-她就交给我了  -我的脸怎么了
- I'll handle it from here. - I got what?

290
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,310
你好像认为你可以在这儿为所欲为
It occurs to me that you think you can do whatever you want here.

291
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,040
这儿不是你的游乐场
This isn't your playground,

292
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,990
而且你想错了
and contrary to what you might think,

293
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,780
我见过代码  不太像你正在写的东西
I know what code looks like, and this certainly isn't code.

294
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,910
没错
You're right.

295
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,890
你说对了
No, you're right.

296
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,910
这不是代码
Yeah, this isn't code.

297
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,210
你也看到了
As you can tell.

298
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,510
我在考虑为了对齐八进制边界
I'm trying to decide if we need to do this multiplication

299
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,440
是否需要进行乘法运算
in order to align on octal boundaries.

300
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,250
我认为  相信你也会同意
Now, my gut says, and I'm sure you'd agree,

301
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,830
如果将将二进制数左移三位
that we can do a shift-left-together three-bit-zero 

302
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,600
右侧补零  不仅更快
fill to the right, which is faster

303
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,840
而且与英特尔80186中的累加器效果相当
and gives the same result on the accumulator on the 186,

304
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,600
不过我也不确定
but... I don't know,

305
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,210
你的意见如何呢
I'd love to hear your thoughts.

306
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,650
你想不出来了
You're stuck.

307
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,050
你知不知道你想干什么
Do you even know what you're trying to do?

308
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,630
好像你就知道似的
What, like you'd know?

309
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,320
让我想想
Give me a minute.

310
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,120
也许我能帮忙
Maybe I could help.

311
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,200
好啊
All right.

312
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,460
你干嘛
What are you doing?

313
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,900
我现在不想再思考这个了
I don't want to think about this anymore.

314
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,920
我需要放空头脑
I need to clear my mind.

315
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,680
那就休息一下
Then take a break.

316
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,980
比如跟黛比和其他员工一起去喝个汽水吗
Like, we can get a soda with Debbie and the rest of the 700 Club?

317
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,400
我和他们不一样
I'm not them.

318
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,420
你得上楼去  乖乖守着你的终端
You need to go upstairs, get back to your terminal.

319
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,750
那我们到底要不要做这个
So, are we gonna do this, or what?

320
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,390
卡迪夫电子  请问您找哪位
Cardiff Electric, how may I direct your call?

321
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,040
请稍等
Please hold.

322
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,710
我得再重申一遍我们完全不了解那个女孩
I'll state for the record again that we know nothing about that girl 

323
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,790
也不知道她会做出什么事来
or what she's capable of.

324
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,040
没错  等她写完BIOS代码
You're right. Once she writes the BIOS code,

325
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,130
就让她走人
we should cut her loose.

326
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:49,920
什么意思
What do you mean?

327
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,240
等她完成BIOS代码
As soon as she finishes the BIOS code,

328
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,560
就不再有法律威胁  也就不需要她了
there's no more legal threat, we don't need her anymore.

329
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,470
哦  好吧  好的
Oh, well, okay, yeah. Yeah, good.

330
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,540
解脱了  我完全理解
Good riddance. Makes perfect sense to me, but 

331
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,140
但眼下我们得让她留在无扰室
right now we need her in the clean room.

332
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,310
那就下楼去和她说
Then you go down and talk to her.

333
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,690
我都不能和她待在一个楼层
I'm not even supposed to be on the same floor as her.

334
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,510
她要是没在桌边敲键盘的话
Look, if she's not at her desk inputting keystrokes,

335
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,050
就没在写BIOS代码
then she's not writing BIOS code, okay?

336
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,120
我们要让她写BIOS代码
We need her writing BIOS code.

337
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,530
好吧
Okay.

338
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,480
妈妈  我想看看
Mommy, I want to see.

339
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,710
好吧  但是要快  好吗
Okay, but real quick, all right?

340
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,500
妈妈要回去上班
'Cause Mommy has to go back to work.

341
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,800
好了  进去  看一眼
All right, get in there. Let's take a look.

342
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,340
看到里面了吗
Do you see way back in there?

343
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,190
是的  原来是在那儿的
That's right. That's where it used to be.

344
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,520
像大峡谷一样
It looks like the Grand Canyon back there.

345
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,040
牙仙子今晚要有大收获了
Tooth fairy's got a good one for tonight.

346
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,910
舌头舔上去黏黏的
It feels slimy on my tongue.

347
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,650
宝贝  这么说好恶心
Sweetheart, that's gross.

348
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,210
来洗洗手
Go ahead, wash your hands.

349
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,460
洗好了吗  亲爱的
You all done, honey?

350
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,400
难刷的也要刷到哦
Gotta get the hard-to-reach ones.

351
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,570
琼妮
Oh, Joanie.

352
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:10,610
很抱歉  我们刚从牙医那儿回来
I'm sorry, we just came from the dentist.

353
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,100
我叫唐娜
I'm Donna.

354
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,200
卡梅伦
Cameron.

355
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,420
-疼吗  -不疼
- Oh, did that hurt? - Nope.

356
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,060
不会吧  拍个手
No way. Low five.

357
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,720
你可真勇敢啊  琼博士
You are braver than brave, Dr. J.

358
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,840
好啦女士们  周六球赛上见
All right, ladies. I'll see you Saturday for the soccer game.

359
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,640
维姬会带些她自己做的甜甜圈  好吃到爆
And Vicki's gonna drop off some homemade donuts that are pow!

360
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,210
好吃极了
Real good.

361
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,980
腿抬高  琼博士
Keep those knees high, Dr. J.

362
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,500
谢谢你  布莱恩
Thanks, Brian.

363
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,030
你觉得怎么样
So, what do you think?

364
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,240
新办公室  我自己的办公室
New office, my own office.

365
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,770
挺不错的吧
Not too shabby, huh?

366
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,540
你怎么了
You okay?

367
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,690
看牙的时间太长了
The dentist just went long.

368
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,740
说到这个  我们该回去了
Speaking of which, we should probably get back.

369
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,890
走吧  小捣蛋
You ready to go, monkey?

370
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,170
-好吧  -爸爸再见
- Okay, well-- - Bye, Daddy.

371
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,650
-再见  爱你哦  -我也爱你
- Bye, love you. - Love you, too.

372
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,960
干嘛啊
Dude.

373
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,470
我现在不需要你帮忙
I don't need your help right now.

374
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,070
它必须和我设想的一样
Look, I need this to be what I need it to be,

375
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,050
不是你想的那个样
not what you want it to be.

376
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,230
我需要一台可以运行IBM电脑程序
I need something that runs IBM PC programs 

377
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,550
而且比IBM电脑还快的东西
faster than an IBM PC.

378
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,380
什么  我说了
What? I told them I wouldn't 

379
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,930
-我不会看原码的  -要是时间充裕
- look at the original code.  - I'd let you do this yourself 

380
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,730
我会让你独立完成的  但我们没时间了
if we had the time, but we don't.

381
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,000
我们要抓住这个稍纵即逝的机会
This gets us in a door that's closing fast.

382
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:44,330
之后就能实施你的伟大设想了
Once we're in, then we can handle those big ideas of yours.

383
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,060
是啊  但用了那些代码  我会进监狱
Yeah, if I copy that code, I go to jail.

384
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,680
IBM知道你会看的
IBM knows you're gonna look at this.

385
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,410
稍稍改动你的BIOS  避开麻烦
You change your BIOS just enough to stay out of trouble.

386
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,590
这样不出一年  
Then, within a year, 

387
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,860
我们的电脑就能和他们的平起平坐
our PC's on a shelf right next to theirs.

388
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:57,530
事情就是这样  来吧  干活儿吧
That's how this works. Come on, let's get in the game.

389
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,640
我在工作
I'm working, 

390
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,420
你为什么不去做产品经理该做的
so why don't you go do whatever it is a product manager does?

391
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,500
天呐
Jesus.

392
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,250
真好吃
That was great.

393
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,120
能拿走了吗  吃完了吗
Can I take that? Are you done?

394
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,270
来  我来吧
Here, no, let me get that.

395
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,370
-不  我来吧  -不用  给我吧
- No, no, I got it. - No, let me get it.

396
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,030
谢了
Thanks.

397
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,730
你今天赶回去工作了吗
So, did you get back to work okay today?

398
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,810
3点过后才回去的
No, not till after 3:00.

399
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,820
幸好亨特没注意到
Thank God Hunt didn't notice.

400
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:41,220
卡梅伦是个女的  她是个女的
Look, Cameron's a girl, okay? She's a girl.

401
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,240
很抱歉  我不知道我为什么没跟你说
I'm sorry, I don't know why I didn't tell you that.

402
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,310
卡梅伦·豪伊是个女的
Cameron Howe is a girl.

403
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,980
乔雇的她  是他招进来的
Joe hired her. It was his call.

404
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,590
她虽说是女的  但她很怪
I said girl, but she's weird.

405

00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,700
卡尔  你是想让我求你吗
Carl. You gonna make me beg for this?

458
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,170
好吧

不过你可别忘了
But you just remember 

462
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,620
是我15年前给你的破公司电脑化的
it was me that computerized your outhouse of a company 15 years ago.

463
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,270
是吗  你这接球手烂透了
Yeah? Yeah, well, you were a lousy receiver whose ass 

464
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:49,350
在场上都不会跑  就配坐冷板凳  卡尔
rode the bench better than he ever ran a damn route, Carl!

465
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,630
卡尔留不住了
Carl's a no.

466
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:00,190
那么  如果自动数据处理公司也要走

471
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,800
失去了这15个客户
Without these 15 clients,

472
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,730
再考虑到目前的营运成本和规模
and given it's current overhead burn and size,

473
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,990
卡迪夫电子还能维持
Cardiff Electric will be able to maintain operation for 

474
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,100
稍少于两个月
a little less than two months.

475
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,890
两个月
Two months?

476
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,920
听到了吗  戈登
Did you get that, Gordon?

477
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,720
两个月
Two months?

478
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,370
艾伦的意思就是  我给你说清楚了
Because what Alan is saying-- and I wanna be clear on this--

479
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:40,250
就是IBM割了我们的喉咙
is that IBM just sliced our throats

480
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,980
要让我们像挂在钩子上的猪一样流血而死
and left us to bleed out like a hog on a hook,

481
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,260
到了下周  外面半数的人
and come next week, half those people out there,

482
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:49,190
都会失去工作  流落街头
they're gonna be out of a job, out on the street,

483
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,180
就为你的个人电脑
because of your personal computer.

484
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,720
你料到了吧
You know this would happen, though.

485
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,520
都是你计划的一部分
It's all part of the plan.

486
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,430
你有计划吧  乔
Tell me you have a plan, Joe.

487
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,220
你只是装相的吗
You were just pretending.

488
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,690
你就是那种
You're like one of those guys 

489
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,830
看多了《麦田里的的守望者》
who goes out and reads "Catcher in the Rye" too many times

490
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,640
于是去枪杀披头士成员的人
and then decides to shoot a Beatle.

491
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,620
但这次  我是列侬
Only in this story, I'm the Beatle.

492
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:18,620
{\an3}{\pos(380,252)}枪杀列侬的马克·查普曼痴迷于《麦田里的守望者》  并说他的作案动机就在书中

493
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,690
你就因为在杂志上读了我一篇文章
Because you read my article in a magazine.

494
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,500
你读了我的文章  就制定了一个计划
You read my article and you made a plan

495
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,410
却完全没有考虑到  会发生这种事...
and never once did you stop to think that something like--

496
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,770
你就带着那副讨厌的笑容  背别人的名言吗
you just recited your magic words with a big, awful smile?

497
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:42,940
在哪
Where is it?

498
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,910
在哪啊
Come on, where is it?

499
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,670
乔
Joe?

500
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,100
她哪去了
Where is she?

501
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,250
BIOS代码
The BIOS.

502
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,300
什么
What?

503
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,200
代码簿在哪  乔
Where's the binder, Joe?

504
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,680
你没把代码簿给她吧
Please tell me you didn't give her the binder.

505
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:19,970
汇编语言代码  IBM BIOS
The assembly language code, the IBM BIOS.

506
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,840
是你想要她回归正途的
Damn it, you wanted her back on track!

507
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,710
别都赖给我
Don't put this on me!

508
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,450
你基本上就是叫我拿给她了
You basically told me to give it to her!

509
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,040
我们要进监狱了
We're going to jail.

510
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,590
我们不会进监狱的  总有办法
We're not going to jail. There's always another move.

511
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,440
本来有的  就是别给她代码簿
There was. It was don't give her the binder.

512
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,590
或许她没走  或许她只是出去了
Maybe she's not gone. Maybe she just stepped out.

513
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:38,370
她不在这儿  也不在终端那儿
Look, she's not here. She's sure as hell not at her terminal.

514
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:41,430
我们又对这姑娘完全不了解
And since we know absolutely nothing about this girl,

515
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,870
除非她在女厕所  我们...
unless she's in the ladies' room, we are--

516
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,750
看啊
Look at this.

517
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,860
看她节省了...
The way she shortcuts the--

518
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,410
乱死了
What a mess.

519
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:04,310
不不
No. No.

520
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,820
不  这太聪明了
No, it's brilliant.

521
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,670
太棒了
It's brilliant.

522
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:03,390
{\an8}要歇业啦  半价出售

523
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,510
那是放卡带的
That's a cassette system.

524
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,070
最新款的
New on the market.

525
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,460
我可以给你个折扣
I could take a little bit more off that for you.

526
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,950
经济不景气嘛
The day's marked for the recession, you know.

527
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,630
我也不是都想怪在滞胀头上
I mean, I don't mean to chalk it up to stagflation... 

528
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,070
但我就是卖不动东西
...just can't seem to move any product.

529
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,750
这你也懂的吧
But you know how that is, right?

530
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,970
你也是个推销员
You're a salesman.

531
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,280
猜中了
I knew it.

532
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,860
果然是同路人
Birds of a feather.

533
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,970
你要关门了吗
So you're going out of business?

534
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,920
是啊  都记不住上次来客人是什么时候了
Yeah, I can't remember my last customer.

535
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,870
我不就是客人吗
I'm a customer. 

536
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,840
推销一台音箱给我
Sell me a stereo.

537
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,330
好吧
Okay.

538
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,180
那是MRF1080
That's the MRF-1080. 

539
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,060
真正的标准系统  可动线圈
True reference system, moving coil--

540
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,380
你的问题在哪
What's your problem?

541
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,750
-什么  -哪里出问题了
- Excuse me? - Where did you go wrong?

542
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,980
这家店为什么要歇业了
Why is this store going out of business?

543
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,130
肯定是有原因的  我想知道是为什么
There must be a reason. I want to know what it is.

544
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,950
我也不知道啊  这都是好东西
Beats me. I mean, the sound quality's great.

545
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,070
但大家就是不想...
People just don't wanna invest--

546
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,340
你就是没预料到
You just didn't see it coming.

547
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:04,170
伙计  我不知道你是闹得哪一出
Look, man, I don't know what this is about, but--

548
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,300
别这样
Hey, don't do that.

549
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,300
别动  你要动就得买  好吗
Hey, man, don't b-- you touch it, you gotta buy it, all right?

550
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,240
-你要弄坏喇叭的  -这就是你的工作吗
- You're gonna blow out the speakers! - Is that your job?

551
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:11,660
别这样
Come on! 

552
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,740
你都预料不到  还在这儿干什么
If you can't see it, why are you even here?

553
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:16,680
我要报警了
I'm calling the cops.

554
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,890
我就待一会儿
This'll only take a minute.

555
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,620
挺舒服啊
Cozy.

556
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,980
你想干什么
What do you want?

557
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,120
可惜  我不能久留
Sadly, I can't stay.

558
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,490
今晚要坐9点半的红眼航班回去
Headed back on the 9:30 red-eye tonight.

559
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,490
走之前想了结最后一件事
Wanted to take care of one last thing before we left, though.

560
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,970
你离开的时候  并没有正式提交辞呈
When you walked out, you never gave formal notice.

561
00:34:58,690 --> 00:34:59,820
欠付工资
Back wages.

562
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:04,150
你还有些没用过的假期
You had some vacation days in the system you never used.

563
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,650
总共615.38块
$615.38.

564
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,940
给你了
There you go. 

565
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,490
615.38块
$615.38.

566
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:16,200
我给数据中心造成了超过两百万的损失
I did over $2 million worth of damage to the data center.

567
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,850
是啊  保险赔付之后
Yeah, well, after the insurance claim,

568
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,090
我们到头来还赚钱了
we ended up making money on that deal, too.

569
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,410
你与IBM的雇佣关系正式结束了
Consider your IBM employee file officially closed.

570
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,850
除非你今晚乘飞机跟我们回去
That is, unless you come back with us on the plane tonight.

571
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:35,610
我们都给你订座了  以防万一
We even booked you a seat, just in case.

572
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:39,720
商务舱  靠过道
It's business class, aisle.

573
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,690
挺不错的
Pretty nice.

574
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,930
我喜欢这里
I like it here.

575
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,170
我向你爸保证至少要试试的
Well, I promised your old man I'd give it a shot.

576
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,890
他应该会失望吧
I'd say he'll be disappointed,

577
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,700
但他已经够失望的了
but he's pretty disappointed already.

578
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,460
你现在可能喜欢这儿
You may like it out here now,

579
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,540
但是
but...

580
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,210
等他们发现你究竟是什么人之后
let's see what happens when they find out

581
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,440
再看看吧
what you really are.

582
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,650
在哪
Where is it? 

583
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:03,610
-什么  -代码簿  BIOS
- Where's what? - The binder, the BIOS.

584
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,310
你给IBM了吗
Did you give it to IBM?

585
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,430
你们究竟找我来干什么
What am I really here for, huh?

586
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,750
四五周  直到我写完  是吗
What, four or five weeks, as long as it takes to write it, right?

587
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,080
然后呢  就打发我走吗
Then what? I'm gone?

588
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,150
什么  不是啊
What? No.

589
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:19,090
不是的  谁说的
N-no, no, who told you that?

590
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,490
便携
Portability.

591
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:28,100
得能让人随身携带
People need to be able to take it anywhere.

592
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,930
要加个把手
It's going to have a handle.

593
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,890
把手
A handle?

594
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:36,210
天呐  乔  真是佩服你
My God, Joe. I gotta give it to you.

595
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,920
这简直是扭转乾坤
This changes everything.

596
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,130
把手  真是革命性的主意
A handle. What a revolutionary idea.

597
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,320
那么还是要做个无聊破玩意的烂复制品
So it's still a piece of shit copy of a boring box?

598
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,630
乔  她把代码簿给了IBM
Joe, she gave the binder to IBM.

599
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,230
什么
You did what?

600
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,120
我没那么说啊
I never said I gave the binder to IBM.

601
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,590
-那在哪  -有什么要紧的
- Then where is it? - What does it matter?

602
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,550
本来我写完BIOS你们也要炒了我
You were gonna fire me after the BIOS anyway.

603
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:56,780
-你能怪我们吗  -那么是真的了
- Yeah, can you blame us? - Oh, so it's true.

604
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,040
好极了
Fantastic.

605
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,430
别担心  IBM说要给我份工作  三倍工资
Not to worry, IBM offered me a job, triple the salary, so--

606
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:03,290
太好了  那里可适合你了
Excellent, excellent. It's a great place to work.

607
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,870
我可以给你写封推荐信
I could write you a recommendation.

608
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:05,840
-真的吗  -是啊
- Would you? - That's right.

609
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,700
对了  你以前在那儿工作呢
That's right, you used to work at IBM.

610
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,160
那是你跑来这儿
That was before you came here

611
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,130
毁掉好几个人的生活  和一家公司之前
and ruined several people's lives and an entire company.

612
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,250
我来之前  你在酗酒  什么都不做
Before me, you were boozing, not building,

613
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,940
是个怕老婆的窝囊废
and your balls were in a box by your wife's bedside table.

614
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,370
够了
Stop it, man!

615
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,360
天呐
Holy shit.

616
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,370
我那年9岁
I was nine.

617
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,320
我学校的几个男生以前会...
There were some boys at my school who used to...

618
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,670
追赶我
chase me.

619
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,290
我不像他们那么关心纽约巨人队
I didn't care about the New York Giants like they did.

620
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,030
我关注的是旅行者1号I cared about Sputnik.

621
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,030
{\pos(225,252)}前苏联人造卫星

622
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,170
我为之疯狂  充满激情
I was nuts about it. I was passionate.

623
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,770
但没人告诉我
Nobody told me yet that 

624
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,610
成年人不该有这种感觉
adults are supposed to be ashamed of those feelings.

625
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:14,180
小马队击败巨人队的那晚  我得到了这个教训
I learned that lesson the night the Colts beat the Giants.

626
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,260
58年的锦标赛  史上最棒的一场比赛
'58 Championship, greatest game ever played,

627
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,160
我根本没看
and I didn't see a single snap.

628
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,930
我重伤躺在圣彼得医院
I was hooked up to machines at St. Peter's.

629
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:26,150
直到今天  我也不怪他们
To this day, I don't blame them.

630
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,930
我觉得他们并非有意把我追下屋顶的
I don't think they meant to chase me off the roof.

631
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,400
离开IBM之后  我走遍全国
After IBM, I went across the country

632
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,380
想寻找答案
just looking for answers.

633
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43,930
我读了你的文章  就一直魂牵梦绕
I'd read your article and I couldn't stop thinking about it.

634
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,080
开放式结构  这个想法
Open architecture, the idea of it.

635
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,450
作为一种生活方式
As a way of life.

636
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:53,180
让我夜不能寐  重新变成了那个执著的孩子
It kept me up at night. It made me that kid again,

637
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,850
我去计算机分销商展览找你
and I tracked you down to COMDEX

638
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,760
看着他们把你和
and watched as they chased you, too,

639
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,990
你精巧的机器也追下了悬崖
and your beautiful machine right off the ledge.

640
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:05,190
你  我看见你的时候
And you, when I saw you,

641
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:08,430
你的一切都让其他人害怕
everything about you threatens people.

642
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,740
我觉得或许我们能做到
I thought that maybe we could do this

643
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,350
就因为我们都是不按常理出牌的人
precisely because we're all unreasonable people

644
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:17,280
进步就靠我们这种人改变世界  来靠拢我们
and progress depends on our changing the world to fit us.

645
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,730
而不是倒过来
Not the other way around.

646
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,740
我想相信这点
I want to believe that.

647
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,470
我必须相信
I must believe that.

648
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,360
明天  我会早上7点来上班
Tomorrow, I will show up at 7:00 A.M.

649
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,240
我会继续前进
and I will keep going.

650
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,630
你们不非得来
You don't have to join me, but...

651
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,350
但我觉得
something tells me

652
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,460
你们都跟我一样需要这个
you both need this just as much as I do.

653
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,720
史上最棒的一场比赛
Greatest game ever played?

654
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,440
小时候  我爸会把那个当睡前故事讲
My dad used to tell me bedtime stories about it as a kid.

655
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,470
加时  雷蒙德·巴里12个接球什么的
Overtime, Raymond Berry's 12 receptions, all that.

656
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,750
比赛是在58年12月
The game was December '58.

657
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,650
旅行者1号近一年前就下来了
Sputnik came down almost a year before that.

658
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,620
是吗
Is that right?

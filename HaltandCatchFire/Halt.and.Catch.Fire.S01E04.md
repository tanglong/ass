	Nathan Cardiff's on the line.
	我的天呐
	Mother Mary.
	-我的天  -别糊弄我们
	- Hot damn! - Don't screw with us.
	你运行没问题吗
	Are you sure you ran it right?
	-检查了三遍了  -戈登在哪里
	- Checked it three times. - Where's Gordon?
	大概还在睡觉吧
	He might still be sleeping.
	是的  我会回去睡觉的
	Yes, I will be home for bedtimes.
	我知道我昨晚也这么说
	I know I said that last night,
	不过今晚我保证
	but tonight I promise.
	注意隐私
	Hey, little privacy.
	什么  可她还没写完呢
	What? But she's not done.
	她先写了硬盘查表子程序
	She did the subroutine for the hard drive table lookups first.
	那就是查表所需的时间
	That's what the seeks clocked in at.
	唐娜  我们刚刚突破了多赫蒂阈值

	我早就知道会很快
	I knew it would be fast.
	-你还要多久忙完  -我不知道  两天
	- How much longer till you're done? - I don't know, two days?
	是一昼一夜还是两个白天
	A day and a night, or two full days?

	今天的成就是一座里程碑
	Today, we hit a milestone.
	工程师衡量一台电脑的速度时
	When engineers measure the speed of a PC,
	常常会提到所谓的
	they talk about something called
	多赫蒂系统响应阈值
	the "Doherty Threshold of System Response Time."
	听上去很高大上  我知道
	It sounds fancy, I know,
	但简单说来
	but, basically, what it means is
	就是当你对电脑进行了一次操作
	when you ask your computer to do something
	敲了回车之后
	and hit the enter key,
	如果电脑在400毫秒以内得出了结果
	if it answers you back in less than 400 milliseconds,
	也就是半秒再短一点
	just under half a second,
	那样你就会黏在电脑前好几个小时
	then you will stay glued to that machine for hours.
	你可能不会一直全神贯注
	Your eyes may glaze over,
	但你的工作效率会狂飙突进
	but your productivity will soar.
	你会更加投入  甚至难舍难分
	You'll be transfixed, mesmerized.
	哪怕响应时间减慢到正好半秒
	Even a slight deviation back to half a second response time
	你的注意力也会分散
	will allow your attention to stray.
	你会站起身来  洗洗盘子
	You'll get up and do the dishes,
	拿起遥控器  看看球赛
	pick up the remote, watch the game.
	但只要低于400毫秒  好了
	But under 400 milliseconds, ah,
	一切都变得美妙了
	that's the sweet spot.
	你猜怎么着
	Well, guess what?
	我们的准卡迪夫个人电脑  尽管看上去一团乱
	Our soon-to-be Cardiff PC, though it looks ragtag now,
	但其测试响应时间达到396毫秒
	just clocked in at 396 milliseconds.
	等组装好后  我们的电脑不仅
	Once assembled, it will not only
	会成为市面上最快的电脑
	be faster than other PCs on the market,
	还会是款令人上瘾的电脑
	it will also be addictive.
	所以抓紧时间陪陪家人吧  各位
	So spend time with your families, folks,
	赶紧跟朋友喝个酒
	get drinks with your friends,
	因为我们电脑一上市  你们就光陪着电脑了
	'cause once our PC hits, you're gonna be hanging out with it.
	另外  黛比  向大家展示一下
	And, hey, Debbie, let's see 'em.
	这些只是我接到的电话的极小一部分
	Now, this is just a smattering of the calls I'm getting now.
	都是潜在的客户  分销商
	Potential customers, retailers,

	Practically begged me to get in the door.
	我们马上就要火了  各位
	We're hitting the radar, people.
	货真价实地火

	让她冲个澡  洗洗头
	Get her to take a shower, wash her hair.
	她不讨厌你  可能会听你的

	你威胁我  好吧
	Oh, a threat. Okay.
	我这么说吧
	Let me lob one back at you.
	要是我走了
	If I leave, if I go,
	就只能写我看到的
	I write what I got,
	你我都知道那可不怎么光彩

	很好  那么你肯定愿意让我留下见识见识
	Great, then I'm sure you'll want me around to see that.

	How long ago, Gordon?
	我们要的是跟得上时代的专业技术
	We need current technical know-how here.
	打断一下  就好像
	Oh, excuse me. Like you'd know
	你就知道什么是专业技术似的
	technical know-how if it hit you in the head.
	你不能来这儿
	Look, you can't be here.
	-很好  好极了  -走吧 姑娘们
	- Great, that's just great. - Come on, girls.
	-女士们  走吧  -你毁了我一整天
	- Ladies, come on. - You blow my whole day
	结果他却让我走人吗
	and he tells me I have to leave?
	等等  孩子们别闹了  把着色簿拿出来
	Hold up. Look, girls, calm down. Get out your coloring book.
	你什么意思
	What are you talking about?
	他还在外面呢
	With him here? Come on.
	现在我们的一言一行都在放大镜下

	你担心那个记者就让他走人啊
	Who, the reporter? So tell him to leave.
	没那么简单
	It's a little more complicated.

	没有唐娜  这事没戏的  乔
	Without Donna, this thing stays dead on the table, Joe.
	她是最好的人选  现在还是唯一的人选
	She is our best option. Right now, she is our only option.
	好吧  但对凯恩说她是卡迪夫的员工
	Fine, but if Kane wants to know, she's a Cardiff employee,
	别用你的真名
	and don't use your real name.
	我有几个问题要问你
	Hey, uh, I need to ask you a couple questions.
	除了留在软驱里的那张软盘
	Besides the floppy you left in the A-drive
	和扬声器边上那一摞
	and the stack near the speakers,
	你确定没在别的软盘上备份过吗
	are you sure you never backed up elsewhere?
	这意思是没有吗
	That's a no?
	好吧  那文件清单什么的呢
	Okay, how about a list of files?
	你有这种单子吗
	Do you keep anything like that?
	没有  灵感来了要忙着创作
	No. When you're in the flow creating something,
	谁会停下来做登记这种无用功
	you don't just stop for some mindless bookkeeping.
	好吧  所以才有现在的麻烦事
	Right, which is why we're here right now.
	你是什么人  谁的妈妈吗
	Who are you, anyways? Just somebody's mother?
	你有底层系统的工作经验吗
	Do you have any clue what it's like to work close to the metal?
	知道我失去了什么吗
	Like, any idea what I've lost?
	告诉你  我还是个毕业于伯克利的工程师
	Well, FYI, I am also an engineer with a degree from Berkeley
	我不仅编过代码
	who's not only created my share of code,
	-还创造出了俩大活人  -老天
	- but given birth to two real humans. - Oh, God.
	所以没错  我是个母亲
	So yeah, I am somebody's mother
	说实话  你现在这副惨相  我看也正缺个妈
	and you could use one right now because, frankly, you're a mess.

	反正读磁头也坏了

	我们得把磁盘装到另一个转轴上
	We'll have to remount it on a different spindle.
	等等  那不会把另一个磁头也弄坏吗
	Wait, won't that just ruin the head on that one?
	是啊  你打算手动转吗
	Yeah, you gonna spin it by hand?

	In fact, my chances of success are greater by a factor of 144.
	也许吧  但你控制不了读取

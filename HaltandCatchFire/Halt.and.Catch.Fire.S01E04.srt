1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,860
20天花130万  你就一句"我知道了"吗
$1.3 million in 20 days and you just-- you just understand?

2
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,490
未来可不便宜  这我们明白
The future's expensive. We knew that.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,020
苹果每天食堂都要花掉这么多
Apple spends that daily on its in-house catering.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,850
苹果卖的个人电脑是可以打字
Apple ships PCs that you can type on,

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,780
还有屏幕的
that have screens.

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,980
那是什么  那是个鱼缸吗
Oh, and what is-- is that a fish tank?

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,900
是  也不是
Yes and no.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,510
你可以把它看成一个时光机
It's actually a time machine.

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,970
为了测试BIOS和硬件
See, to test the BIOS and hardware

00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:29,840
在我们的目标速度下的运行情况
at the speed we're gunning for,

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,760
我们需要一块12.5兆赫的286we need the 12 and a half megahertz 286,

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,760
{\pos(260,252)}英特尔当时推出的CPU型号

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,580
但它还没有问世  我们只有8兆赫的
but it's not out yet. We only have the eight,

14
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,020
我们如果超频这块8兆赫的
and if we overclock the eight-- pfft--

15
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,390
芯片瞬间就会烧毁  这位拉里
The chip will fry in seconds, so Larry here--

16
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:37,950
是斯坦
Stan.

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,190
斯坦将芯片浸泡在矿物油中以降温
Stan's put the chip in mineral oil and cranked down the temp.

18
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,940
冷却使它可以在12.5兆赫运行
Cooling it makes it run at 12 and a half megahertz,

19
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,280
这样我们便可以在明天到来之前
so we get to design tomorrow

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,490
设计未来
before tomorrow's even here.

21
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,910
那怎么花了这么久
Well, what's taking so long?

22
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,010
计算机分销商展览时我们的原型机就能出来
We're right on track to have our prototype ready for COMDEX.

23
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:50,710
那可是在十一月
In November.

24
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,530
快看这个  看这个
Oh, and, hey, look at this, look at this.

25
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,170
三块四层的印刷电路板  这是新规范
Three four-layer PCBs. That's the new norm.

26
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,140
我们个人电脑的目标是12兆赫
Our PC's aiming for 12.

27
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,330
想象一下
So, imagine, um,

28
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,430
一个隐形的地铁系统  电子是列车
an invisible subway system with electrons as trains.

29
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,650
更多层次  更少碰撞
More layers, fewer collisions,

30
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,060
考虑到它是光速  真的很不可思议
which is pretty amazing when you're moving at the speed of light.

31
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,900
实际上电子的速度是光速的三分之一
The electrons actually move at one third the speed of light.

32
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,230
细节不重要  斯坦
Bigger point here, Stan,

33
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,310
你还是别说话了
please stop talking.

34
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,860
你要写的支票能实现这些创新
The checks you're writing are making innovation happen.

35
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,080
这难道不美妙吗
Tell me that's not beautiful,

36
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,540
你不感到兴奋吗
that you don't feel the excitement.

37
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,820
我会"感到兴奋"的
I will "feel the excitement"

38
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,940
等有我们商标的能运行Lotus 1-2-3的克隆电脑

00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,080
掏钱包抢购的时候
to get to it with their wallets hanging open.

44
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,560
我能明白你的感受
I imagine how you must feel.

45
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,140
知识如此局限的人
It's difficult to believe in something

46
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,070
是很难产生信念
when your knowledge is so limited.

47
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,940
内森·卡迪夫的电话
Nathan Cardiff's on the line.

48
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,680
我的天呐
Mother Mary.

49

396毫秒
396 milliseconds.

50
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,850
-我的天  -别糊弄我们
- Hot damn! - Don't screw with us.

51
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,160
你运行没问题吗
Are you sure you ran it right?

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,990
-检查了三遍了  -戈登在哪里
- Checked it three times. - Where's Gordon?

53
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,360
大概还在睡觉吧
He might still be sleeping.

54
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,080
是的  我会回去睡觉的
Yes, I will be home for bedtimes.

55
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,640
我知道我昨晚也这么说
I know I said that last night,

56
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,120
不过今晚我保证
but tonight I promise.

57
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,980
注意隐私
Hey, little privacy.

58
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,160
396毫秒
396 milliseconds.

59
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,920
什么  可她还没写完呢
What? But she's not done.

60
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,490
她先写了硬盘查表子程序
She did the subroutine for the hard drive table lookups first.

61
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,120
那就是查表所需的时间
That's what the seeks clocked in at.

62
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,970
唐娜  我们刚刚突破了多赫蒂阈值
Donna, we just hit the Doherty Threshold.

63

不  我知道  我知道  我爱你
No, I know. I know. I love you.

64
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,570
我们突破了多赫蒂阈值
We hit the Doherty Threshold.

65
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,520
某人熬夜学习了
Someone's been up late studying.

66
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,810
在你喝着第19罐汽水嘲笑我之余
Maybe between mocking me and your 19th orange soda,

67
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,770
也可以稍稍表示下开心
you could register a little happiness.

68
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,470
我早就知道会很快
I knew it would be fast.

69
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,460
-你还要多久忙完  -我不知道  两天
- How much longer till you're done? - I don't know, two days?

70
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,400
是一昼一夜还是两个白天
A day and a night, or two full days?

71
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,480
31.29小时又13纳秒
31.29 hours and 13 nanoseconds.

72
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,380
你能不能快走  把门关上
Can you leave and shut the door?

73
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,470
我要召开一次动员大会
I'm calling a team-building meeting.

74
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,070
逗呢吧你
You're joking, right?

75
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,330
伙计们  都过来  都过来
All right, gather round, come closer.

76
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,980
今天的成就是一座里程碑
Today, we hit a milestone.

77
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,940
工程师衡量一台电脑的速度时
When engineers measure the speed of a PC,

78
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,220
常常会提到所谓的
they talk about something called

79
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,610
多赫蒂系统响应阈值
the "Doherty Threshold of System Response Time."

80
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,280
听上去很高大上  我知道
It sounds fancy, I know,

81
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,650
但简单说来
but, basically, what it means is

82
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,960
就是当你对电脑进行了一次操作
when you ask your computer to do something

83
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,370
敲了回车之后
and hit the enter key,

84
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,380
如果电脑在400毫秒以内得出了结果
if it answers you back in less than 400 milliseconds,

85
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,050
也就是半秒再短一点
just under half a second,

86
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,740
那样你就会黏在电脑前好几个小时
then you will stay glued to that machine for hours.

87
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,270
你可能不会一直全神贯注
Your eyes may glaze over, 

88
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,080
但你的工作效率会狂飙突进
but your productivity will soar.

89
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,380
你会更加投入  甚至难舍难分
You'll be transfixed, mesmerized.

90
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,300
哪怕响应时间减慢到正好半秒
Even a slight deviation back to half a second response time

91
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,150
你的注意力也会分散
will allow your attention to stray.

92
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,010
你会站起身来  洗洗盘子
You'll get up and do the dishes,

93
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,420
拿起遥控器  看看球赛
pick up the remote, watch the game.

94
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,110
但只要低于400毫秒  好了
But under 400 milliseconds, ah,

95
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,790
一切都变得美妙了
that's the sweet spot.

96
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:37,960
你猜怎么着
Well, guess what?

97
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,330
我们的准卡迪夫个人电脑  尽管看上去一团乱
Our soon-to-be Cardiff PC, though it looks ragtag now,

98
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:47,110
但其测试响应时间达到396毫秒
just clocked in at 396 milliseconds.

99
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,030
等组装好后  我们的电脑不仅
Once assembled, it will not only

100
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,270
会成为市面上最快的电脑
be faster than other PCs on the market,

101
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,540
还会是款令人上瘾的电脑
it will also be addictive.

102
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,340
所以抓紧时间陪陪家人吧  各位
So spend time with your families, folks,

103
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,510
赶紧跟朋友喝个酒
get drinks with your friends,

104
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,990
因为我们电脑一上市  你们就光陪着电脑了
'cause once our PC hits, you're gonna be hanging out with it.

105
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,740
另外  黛比  向大家展示一下
And, hey, Debbie, let's see 'em.

106
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,490
这些只是我接到的电话的极小一部分
Now, this is just a smattering of the calls I'm getting now.

107
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,730
都是潜在的客户  分销商
Potential customers, retailers,

108
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,900
都迫切想知道我们的产品什么样
and they all wanna know what we're up to.

109
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,300
明天  《华尔街季刊》会派记者来
And tomorrow a reporter from the "Wall Street Quarterly"

110
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,680
报道我们的事
is coming to do a story on us.

111
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,070
他几乎要跪下求我了
Practically begged me to get in the door.

112
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,570
我们马上就要火了  各位
We're hitting the radar, people.

113
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,700
货真价实地火
I mean, really cooking with gas.

114
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,060
所以  我们或许应该
So it's only appropriate...

115
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,060
别别别  你这是捣乱
No, no, no, no. You'll contaminate.

116
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,410
-大家快跑  -乔  你要做什么
- Everybody disperse. - Joe, what are you doing?

117
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,290
快把那东西拿开
Get that thing outta here.

118
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,820
-你会毁了整件事的  -别闹了  乔
- You could blow the whole thing.  - Come on, Joe. 

119
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,470
别紧张  谁都不用跑
Relax. No one goes anywhere.

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,410
这才叫烧书呢
Oh, that's what I call cooking the books!

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,410
{\pos(262,273)}意为做假账

122
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,510
不嘛  爸爸  我要穿粉红的
No, Daddy, my pink ones.

123
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,190
海莉别闹了  这袜子够粉了
Haley, stop. These are pink enough.

124
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,600
你的粉袜子脏了  亲爱的
Your pinks are dirty, sweetie.

125
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,450
苹果片配花生酱怎么样
Apple slices and peanut butter?

126
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,470
不要  会变成褐色
Yuck, they turn brown!

127
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,450
淋上柠檬汁就不会了
Not if I put lemon juice.

128
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,070
就穿红的吧  海莉
Just wear the red ones, Haley.

129
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,900
为什么妈妈说让你穿袜子
Why is it that when Mommy says, "Wear the socks,"

130
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,760
-你就老实穿了  -戈登
- you suddenly wear the socks? - Gordon.

131
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,490
好吧  宝贝  去穿鞋
All right, Smooch, go put your shoes on.

132
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,130
也许我们应该重新开始抽大麻
Maybe we should start smoking pot again.

133
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,640
那就不会焦躁了
That'd take off the edge.

134
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,370
是啊  我们也永远下不来床了
Yeah, and we'd never get out of bed.

135
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,240
你怎么这么早就听这个
How can you listen to this so early in the morning?

136
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,950
不会让你烦躁吗
Doesn't it get on your nerves?

137
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,770
2点15  别忘了
So, 2:15, don't forget.

138
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,320
是在操场  不在交通环岛
At the playground, not the traffic circle.

139
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,510
你去接孩子  带到6点
You're picking up the girls. You'll have them till 6:00.

140
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,140
还有这事
That's right.

141
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,680
-等等  你不能...  -不行
- Wait, can't you just-- - No, no, I can't.

142
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,800
亨特最近已经很照顾我了
Hunt's been covering for me way too much lately.

143
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,260
这次不能再迟交了
I can't be late with this one.

144
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,160
-你妈妈呢  -我都说了  他们在维加斯
- Well, what about your mom? - They're in Vegas, I told you.

145
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,580
萝丝得了水痘  你有听我说话吗
And Rose has the chicken pox. Do you listen?

146
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,520
好吧  我忘了  2点15
Fine, I blanked. 2:15 it is.

147
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,460
谢谢
Thank you.

148
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,190
记得下班赶紧回家
But please come home right after.

149
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,950
我还要回公司
I'm gonna have to go back to the office.

150
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,060
海莉把我的牙刷扔进了有尿尿的马桶
Haley threw my toothbrush in the toilet with pee pee in it.

151
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,800
我在做饭呢
I'm handling food here.

152
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,100
好吧  跟爸爸走
All right, come on.

153
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,040
咱们去把牙刷捞出来
Let's get the pee pee toothbrush out.

154
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,900
你对她做了什么  你说了什么
What did you do to her? What did you say?

155
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,050
戈登  别太拼命了
Gordon, hey, don't work too hard!

156
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,820
早
Mornin'.

157
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,180
我买了甜甜圈  放在休息室了
I got donuts. I put 'em in the break room.

158
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,300
我可不想让记者
I don't want that fancy reporter 

159
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,240
觉得我们故意怠慢
thinking we ain't got no hospitality.

160
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,050
你没事吧
You all right?

161
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,410
我想我需要你帮忙
I think I need your help.

162
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,460
好的
Okay.

163
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,460
如果《华尔街季刊》能刊登我们的报道
Getting an article about us in the "Wall Street Quarterly,"

164
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,730
正面报道  能改变整个形势
the right article, that could be a game-changer,

165
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,430
打响个人电脑的名头  将公司领向巅峰
put our PC on the map, take this company into the stratosphere,

166
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,250
但如果我们看起来邋里邋遢  不可靠
but if we seem sloppy or fly-by-night,

167
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,410
给人留下坏印象  一切努力就付之东流了
if we project the wrong image, then it could all fall apart.

168
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,010
我要换上点心吗
Should I have gotten pastries instead?

169
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,390
不  甜甜圈挺好
No, those are fine.

170
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,500
我们真正的麻烦是卡梅伦
Our real problem is Cameron.

171
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,260
她的工作间跟猪圈似的
Her work station's a pigsty.

172
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,110
这很不专业  很不卫生
It's unprofessional, it's unsanitary.

173
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,010
坦白说  简直丢人
Frankly, it's embarrassing.

174
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,300
我们得在凯恩来之前把那儿收拾干净
We've gotta get it cleaned up before Kane gets here.

175
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,560
他约了11点
Well, he's scheduled for 11:00.

176
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,700
让清洁班赶紧打扫
Yeah, tell the cleaning crew to hurry.

177
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,630
但她不会允许他们打扫的
But she'll never let 'em.

178
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,180
你也知道她这个人
You know how she is.

179
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,150
是啊
Yeah.

180
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,670
你住在这附近  对吧
You live close to here, right?

181
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,570
对  就在伯克斯顿街
Yeah, just down on Buxton.

182
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,030
说服她去你那里休息一下
Then convince her to go back to your place for a break.

183
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,050
让她冲个澡  洗洗头
Get her to take a shower, wash her hair.

184
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,010
她不讨厌你  可能会听你的
She doesn't hate you and might listen.

185
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,020
女人之间好说话嘛
You know, woman to woman or...

186
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,400
你是她上司  你说不行吗
Well, you're her boss. Can't you talk to her?

187
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,750
穿胸罩这种事我不好跟她讲  黛比
I can't tell her to put on a bra, Debbie.

188
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,350
你可以
You can.

189
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,440
一定让她穿上
And please do.

190
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,960
好吧  我尽力吧
Okay. I'll do my best.

191
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

192
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,200
米莉的香肠吃够了吗
You get enough of Milly's sausage?

193
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,740
再吃一口
Another bite and I'd, 

194
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,570
我就要撑炸了
hell, pop like a mosquito sucking a pig.

195
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,930
可还是很好吃  她真厉害
Good as ever, though. She is somethin'.

196
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,970
是啊  真是不错
Yep, she's a keeper.

197
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,850
俗话说  好佣人难找
Like they say, John, "Good help is hard to find."

198
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,770
谢谢你的早餐  内森
Yeah, well, thanks for breakfast, Nathan.

199
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,670
我得赶快回去了
I guess I'd best be getting on back to it.

200
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,430
回哪
To what?

201
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,130
什么
Beg your pardon?

202
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,590
你急什么
What's your rush?

203
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,600
乔·麦克米伦不是都安排妥当了吗
Thought Joe MacMillan had everything pretty much in hand.

204
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,750
你知道什么事我放不下吗
You know what I just can't shake?

205
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:17,350
露露不投资咱的个人电脑项目  我理解
Loulu not funding our PC pipe dream, that I get.

206
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,720
她不好应付
She's a tough one.

207
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,730
可是三周了还不回我电话吗
But her not returning my calls after three weeks?

208
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,590
-乔骂她了...  -胡扯
- Joe called that woman names-- - Bullshit.

209
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,550
-他不会...  -胡扯
- He wouldn't-- - Bullshit.

210
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,680
你怎么骂露露都可以
You could call Loulu a redneck sack of goat sperm.

211
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,070
只要她觉得赚钱
She'd still do business with you 

212
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,020
还是会跟你做生意
if she thought she could make a buck.

213
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,100
你养成习惯了吗
Is that your new M.O.?

214
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,030
不管我问什么  你都说"乔"怎么怎么样
I ask a question, first thing you say is, "Joe..."?

215
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,720
得了  当然不是
Ah, come-- no, of course not.

216
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,590
老实回答我
I want a straight answer.

217
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,990
现在谁管事
Who's running things?

218
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,780
我
I am.

219
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,670
最好是这样  因为已经有闲话了
You better be 'cause folks are starting to talk.

220
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,840
说你掌控不了局面什么的
They're saying that you're letting this thing run away from ya.

221
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,370
谁是谁上司  给搞明白
Make clear who's working for who

222
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,910
不然咱俩都得成为笑柄
or else we're both gonna look like idiots.

223
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,110
好了  你自己认路吧
All right, I think you know your way out.

224
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,330
有了这块加宽的芯片载体
And with this extra-wide chip carrier,

225
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,840
中央处理器和协处理器
the CPU and coprocessor

226
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,140
可以接在同一排线里
can be clipped into a single ribbon cable.

227
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,360
这只是帮助我们突破多赫蒂阈值的
It's just one of the many innovations that helped us 

228
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,800
众多创新之处之一
hit the Doherty Threshold.

229
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,650
你不是工程师吧
You're not an engineer, are ya?

230
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,490
什么
What?

231
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,980
你的话像是排练出来的
You just sound a bit canned, that's all.

232
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,190
像是别人教你的
Like you're repeating what people told you 

233
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,480
或是你从书上看的
or getting it from books.

234
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,670
当然不是  我是产品经理
No, I'm the product manager.

235
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,740
-我有没有相关的学位...  -我的意思是
- Do I have a degree in-- - I mean,

236
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,530
-还多赫蒂阈值呢  得了吧  -没有
- the Doherty Threshold? Come on.  - No.

237
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,130
你知道有多少公司在测试时
You know how many companies think they hit that

238
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,890
以为自己突破阈值了吗  全部
in the testing phase? All of them.

239
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,820
想用散热片和机箱来搭建计算机
Try building the damn thing with the heat sink and the case.

240
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,400
可拿到现实中来
Once the realities of physics kick in,

241
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,380
就完全不一样了
it's a whole new ball game.

242
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,660
而且这本杂志也不是面向电脑爱好者的
Not to mention I don't write for "Hobbyists' Weekly."

243
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,180
读者看不了几眼就没兴趣了
My readers will be asleep in seconds.

244
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,710
-好吧  不是没道理  -乔
- Okay, fair enough. - Joe, 

245
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,520
电话里我就说了  我来只是因为
I told you on the phone, I came here 

246
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,130
纽约的马特·加里森说欠你个人情
because Matt Garrison in New York said he owed you a favor.

247
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,990
我又欠他个人情  所以答应过来
I owed him one, so I said I'd pop by, 

248
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,620
但现在  我得走了
but now I gotta go.

249
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,160
罗恩  拜托
Ron, please, please.

250
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,770
和员工聊聊  听听他们的故事
Just meet some of our people, get their stories.

251
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,610
你绝对能写一篇在劣势中抗争的文章
There's an underdog angle here

252
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,870
你肯定能挖到好料的
I guarantee you'll find interesting.

253
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,480
-好吧  15分钟  -好
- Fine. 15 minutes. - Great.

254
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,530
如你所见  我们不在娱乐设施上浪费钱
As you can see, we don't waste money on amenities

255
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,070
你听过关于电脑程序员的那个笑话吧
because, hey, you know programmers. What's the joke?

256
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,660
吃披萨  生产代码的机器
"They're just machines for turning pizza into code."

257
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,960
好有趣
Yeah, good one.

258
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,070
只是这次  是个女孩  卡梅伦
But Cameron, in this case, is a girl.

259
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,000
很少见女孩子干这行吧
Yep, you don't see that every day.

260
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,550
22岁  聪明过人
22, brilliant,

261
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,990
写的BIOS代码颠覆世界
and writing a BIOS that defies belief.

262
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,640
-怎么了  -都没了
- What happened? - It's gone.

263
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,210
我所有的代码
All my code, I --

264
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,890
重启过了吗
Did you try booting it up again?

265
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,440
连提示符都没有
I can't even get a prompt.

266
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,630
没事  可能只是显示器
All right, look, it's probably just the monitor 

267
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,880
或连接的问题  伙计们
or the connection. Guys...

268
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,720
怎么回事
What -- what's happening?

269
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,190
你有备份的  对吧
You backed it up, right?

270
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,190
有一点
Yeah -- yeah, at some point.

271
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,560
什么叫有一点
"At some point"?

272
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,440
这是什么
What's that?

273
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:09,870
搞什么
What the...? 

274
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,720
你开玩笑吧  伙计们  是电涌
Are you kidding me? Guys, it was a power surge.

275
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,470
可能只烧坏了磁盘
Probably just burned out the disks.

276
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,210
你的备用盘呢
Where are your backup floppies?

277
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,290
软驱里有一张  烧焦了
She left one in the A-drive. It's toast.

278
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,910
文件分配表肯定没了
FAT's gotta be empty.

279
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,390
卡梅伦  其他备用盘呢
Cameron, where are the other ones?

280
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,430
给  都查一遍
Here, check 'em.

281
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,780
没东西
No.

282
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,050
-这张被消磁了  -这个也是  空的
- This one's degaussed. - This one, too -- wiped.

283
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,500
什么  怎么可能啊
What? How is that possible?

284
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,080
真空吸尘器
A vacuum cleaner?

285
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,340
你把吸尘器和我的电脑插在了一个插座里
You plugged your vacuum cleaner in my computer?!

286
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,290
-抱歉  -告诉我到底怎么回事
- Sorry, sorry! - Just walk me through what happened.

287
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,330
你...把备用盘放扬声器旁边
You put your -- you put your backups next to your speakers

288
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,070
然后还放歌  神哪  卡梅伦
and then you blast music? Good God, Cameron.

289
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,880
-你怎么不直接在盘上放块磁铁算了  -放开我
- Why didn't you just put a magnet up to them? - Get off!

290
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,720
镇定一点
Hey, calm down!

291
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,420
这人又是谁
Who the hell is this?

292
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:24,270
罗恩·凯恩  《华尔街季刊》的记者
Ron Kane, "Wall Street Quarterly."

293
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,060
好啦  孩子们  走啦  我们去找爸爸
Okay, girls. Let's go. Let's go see your dad.

294
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,500
-好吗  -爸爸  你迟到了
- Ok?  - Daddy! You're late. 

295
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,810
费丽思老师只好打电话叫妈妈来了
Miss Ferris had to call mommy.

296
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,200
-抱歉  -我就要你做这么一件事
- I know. I know.  - I asked you to do one thing. 

297
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,470
你记不住写手上行不行
You can't write it on your arm?

298
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,370
-不能让助理提醒你吗  -出了点意外
- You can't get an admin to remind you? - Things got crazy, okay?

299
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,590
我今天倒霉透了
I'm having kind of a day here.

300
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,890
还成了你倒霉了
Oh, you're having kind of a day?

301
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,460
我又有个任务要交迟了  我还保证不会呢
Now I'm gonna miss another deadline that I promised I'd make.

302
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,130
可是我的工作更重要啊
Well, maybe the stakes are a little bit higher in my world, okay?

303
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,750
-我又不是在给计算器做测试  -什么
- I'm not just QA-ing calculators. - Excuse me? 

304
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,310
-我没...  -戈登
- I didn't--  - Gordon, 

305
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,780
我问你
let me ask you something.

306
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,490
你上一次剪她们的脚趾甲是什么时候
When is the last time you cut their toenails?

307
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,440
你哪一个女儿对杏过敏
Or which one of your daughters is allergic to apricots?

308
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,210
你知道她们儿科大夫的名字吗
Do you even know their pediatrician's name?

309
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,160
不知道吧  因为你不必知道
No, you don't? Because you don't have to.

310
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,160
-是我打理好了你的生活  -妈妈  回家吧
- I make your world possible. - Mommy, let's go home.

311
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,050
没事了  我们...
It's okay, it's okay. We're just--

312
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,510
带她们走吧  戈登  我们回家再谈
just take them, Gordon. We'll talk at home.

313
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,380
唐娜
Donna.

314
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,130
-我的天  你不能带她们走  -是的
- Oh, my God, you can't. - No.

315
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,520
你都不能带会儿她们吗
You can't even take them.

316
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,740
我需要你去趟卡迪夫
I need you to come to Cardiff.

317
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,650
-很乱  是吧  -乱成一锅粥
- Crazy back there, huh? - Pretty sported.

318
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,420
我以为他们要打起来了
Thought they might come to blows. 

319
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,470
希望我可以在这儿工作
I hope it's okay that I set up here.

320
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,460
你的秘书  叫什么来着
Your gal-- what's her name--

321
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,110
她说她觉得没问题
said she thought it would be fine.

322
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,500
不如你下礼拜再来吧
Look, why don't you come back next week?

323
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:48,030
我们的首席工程师说这没什么大不了的
Our head engineer just told me this whole thing's no big deal,

324
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,370
但就算如此  也挺让人分心的
but even so, it's kind of distracting.

325
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,390
我说实话吧  乔
Let me level with you, Joe.

326
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,920
我本来没打算写这个公司的报道
I was never gonna write a word about this company.

327
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,620
我认为你们能打入个人电脑市场的可能性
I think its odds of being a player in the PC market

328
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,350
跟给我修洗衣机的那家伙一样大
are about on par with the guys who fix my washer-dryer.

329
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,110
我来只是看在马特的面子上
I came only as a favor to Matt.

330
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,700
但是  你瞧  好心有好报
But lo and behold, the universe paid me back,

331
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,780
让我能见证一家太过心高气远的公司
gave me a story about a company flying too close to the sun

332
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,670
在IBM的阴影下毁于一旦
that burnt to a crisp in IBM's shadow.

333
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,960
伤痛  希望落空  梦想破灭
The pain, the dashed hopes and dreams.

334
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,120
写个五千字  再署个名
5,000 words on that, a byline,

335
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,600
我终于能离开这个烂地方
I might finally get off this crappy beat

336
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,900
回华尔街
and make it back to Wall Street

337
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,020
或者硅谷  那些值得报道的地方了
or Silicon Valley, where the real action is.

338
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,320
也就是说  我拿到全部素材之前
All of which is to say I'm not leaving

339
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,840
是不会离开这里的
till I get this in all its gory glory.

340
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,350
也许你没听明白
Maybe you don't understand.

341
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,250
我不是请你离开  罗恩
I'm not asking you, Ron.

342
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,850
你威胁我  好吧
Oh, a threat. Okay.

343
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,130
我这么说吧
Let me lob one back at you.

344
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,050
要是我走了
If I leave, if I go,

345
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:43,940
就只能写我看到的  
I write what I got, 

346
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,340
你我都知道那可不怎么光彩
and we both know that ain't pretty.

347
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,860
可我要是留下
Other hand, let me stay,

348
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,650
也许能报道整件事  好的和不好的都写
maybe I get the full story-- good with the bad.

349
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,550
卡迪夫的工程师是硅草原最好的
Cardiff's engineers are the best in the Silicon Prairie...

350
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,170
这可不够
That's not saying much.

351
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,650
他们会找到办法度过这个难关
 ...and they will find a way through this.

352
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,110
小麻烦而已  没什么大不了
It's a bump, that's all.

353
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,000
很好  那么你肯定愿意让我留下见识见识
Great, then I'm sure you'll want me around to see that.

354
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,700
不然的话  慢着  你刚刚都是胡扯吗
Or, wait, was that all bullshit?

355
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,060
这就是你的数据检索专家吗
This is your data retrieval expert?

356
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,530
你也好啊
Hello to you, too.

357
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,720
她的毕业论文是关于磁储存器的
She did her thesis on magnetic storage.

358
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,060
多久以前的事了  戈登  
How long ago, Gordon? 

359
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,290
我们要的是跟得上时代的专业技术
We need current technical know-how here.

360
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,630
打断一下  就好像
Oh, excuse me. Like you'd know

361
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,220
你就知道什么是专业技术似的
technical know-how if it hit you in the head.

362
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,070
你不能来这儿
Look, you can't be here.

363
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,640
-很好  好极了  -走吧 姑娘们
- Great, that's just great. - Come on, girls.

364
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,120
-女士们  走吧  -你毁了我一整天
- Ladies, come on. - You blow my whole day 

365
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,470
结果他却让我走人吗
and he tells me I have to leave?

366
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,410
等等  孩子们别闹了  把着色簿拿出来
Hold up. Look, girls, calm down. Get out your coloring book.

367
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,900
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

368
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,680
他还在外面呢
With him here? Come on.

369
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,790
现在我们的一言一行都在放大镜下
Everything we do will be open to scrutiny.

370
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,500
你担心那个记者就让他走人啊
Who, the reporter? So tell him to leave.

371
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,160
没那么简单
It's a little more complicated.

372
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,720
有你在  当然什么都不简单
With you, that's a big surprise.

373
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,150
我这是为你考虑
I'm actually thinking about you.

374
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,440
如果被人发现你来这儿  就算是来帮忙
If it comes out that you're working here, even as a favor,

375
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,720
你在德州仪器的上司会没意见吗
you think your bosses at TI would be okay with it?

376
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,280
真的就为这个吗  乔
Is that it, Joe, really?

377
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,500
还是你不想让大家觉得
Or do you not want anyone thinking 

378
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,580
你连自己都顾不全
you couldn't save your own...ass?

379
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,600
我不想要你老婆留在办公室
I don't want your wife at the office.

380
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,190
你到底怎么回事
What the hell's the matter with you?

381
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,110
没有唐娜  这事没戏的  乔
Without Donna, this thing stays dead on the table, Joe.

382
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,490
她是最好的人选  现在还是唯一的人选
She is our best option. Right now, she is our only option.

383
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,930
好吧  但对凯恩说她是卡迪夫的员工
Fine, but if Kane wants to know, she's a Cardiff employee,

384
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,570
别用你的真名
and don't use your real name.

385
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,100
我有几个问题要问你
Hey, uh, I need to ask you a couple questions.

386
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,010
除了留在软驱里的那张软盘
Besides the floppy you left in the A-drive

387
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,380
和扬声器边上那一摞
and the stack near the speakers,

388
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,140
你确定没在别的软盘上备份过吗
are you sure you never backed up elsewhere?

389
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,400
这意思是没有吗
That's a no?

390
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,920
好吧  那文件清单什么的呢
Okay, how about a list of files? 

391
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,120
你有这种单子吗
Do you keep anything like that?

392
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,110
没有  灵感来了要忙着创作
No. When you're in the flow creating something,

393
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,450
谁会停下来做登记这种无用功
you don't just stop for some mindless bookkeeping.

394
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,010
好吧  所以才有现在的麻烦事
Right, which is why we're here right now.

395
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,560
你是什么人  谁的妈妈吗
Who are you, anyways? Just somebody's mother?

396
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,450
你有底层系统的工作经验吗
Do you have any clue what it's like to work close to the metal?

397
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,670
知道我失去了什么吗
Like, any idea what I've lost?

398
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:50,090
告诉你  我还是个毕业于伯克利的工程师
Well, FYI, I am also an engineer with a degree from Berkeley

399
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,170
我不仅编过代码
who's not only created my share of code,

400
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,980
-还创造出了俩大活人  -老天
- but given birth to two real humans. - Oh, God.

401
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,060
所以没错  我是个母亲
So yeah, I am somebody's mother

402
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,860
说实话  你现在这副惨相  我看也正缺个妈
and you could use one right now because, frankly, you're a mess.

403
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,480
别烦我了
Leave me alone. 

404
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,370
去烧个胸罩什么的吧
Go burn a bra or something.

405
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,370
{\an3}{\pos(380,252)}20世纪70年代女权主义者的呐喊

406
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,780
真会说  我们刚把萨莉·莱德送上了太空
That's great. Sally Ride just went to space

407
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,280
你把工作搞得一团糟  
and here's you screwing up at work 

408
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,350
就像小孩一样冲着想帮你的人发脾气
and lashing out like a child at the people trying to help you.

409
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,960
你睡了老板才得到这份工作
You slept with the boss to get here.

410
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,260
我总算明白为什么了
Now I know why you had to.

411
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,380
我现在还和他睡呢
Oh, I'm still sleeping with him,

412
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,080
如果你想知道的话  母夜叉
in case you're wondering, bitch.

413
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,800
你还真是毫无自尊啊
You really don't think much of yourself, do you?

414
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,270
去死吧
Go to hell.

415
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,290
磁盘烧了  好吧  不就是不能转了吗
It's melted, fine, so it can't spin.

416
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,600
反正读磁头也坏了
The read head's damaged anyway.

417
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,420
我们得把磁盘装到另一个转轴上
We'll have to remount it on a different spindle.

418
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,470
等等  那不会把另一个磁头也弄坏吗
Wait, won't that just ruin the head on that one?

419
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,630
是啊  你打算手动转吗
Yeah, you gonna spin it by hand?

420
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,660
-一次一微米  -是
- A micron at a time? - Yes.

421
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,890
如果宇航局的人能手工磨出
If the guys at NASA can grind parabolic mirrors

422
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,460
黄光六分之一波长大小的抛物柱面镜
to within one sixth of the wavelength of yellow light by hand,

423
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,090
我也能控制磁盘的旋转速度
I'm pretty sure I can control the rotation of a disk.

424
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:13,160
其实我的成功率比他们高144倍呢
In fact, my chances of success are greater by a factor of 144.

425
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,550
也许吧  但你控制不了读取
Maybe, but no way the ins and outs.

426
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,270
没错  所以我们要做些改进
Exactly, which is why we'll modify it.

427
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,640
不在磁头上用双转子马达  用步进马达
Use the stepper motor on the head, not the spinner motor.

428
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,000
每一转读取一次数据
Remove the data one click at a time,

429
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,820
再备份到第三个软驱里
back up to a third drive.

430
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,690
唯一的问题就是
Only problem being

431
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,540
就算我们等到死你也做不完
we'll die of old age before you finish.

432
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,110
只要文件分配表还在就不会
Not if the FAT's intact.

433
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,960
要是有分配表的话  除了这些烧掉的数据
That way, aside from the fried files,

434
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,030
我还可以通过推导重建BIOS
I can reassemble the BIOS by deduction.

435
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,200
我觉得她比你更能干
I think she's smarter than you are.

436
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,870
从遇见她那一刻起我就知道了
I knew that the moment I met her.

437
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,270
我本来就配不上她
How I'd never really deserve her.

438
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,630
说实话  她还跟着我简直让我吃惊
And, frankly, I'm amazed she puts up with me.

439
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,970
有人正在伤心呢
Someone's in the doghouse.

440
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,730
好了  我们开始吧
Come on, let's do this.

441
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,670
你还好吗
Hey, you all right?

442
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,430
我给你带了点吃的
I brought you something to eat.

443
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,410
走开
Just go.

444
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,420
很好  你可以做数据转移
Okay, you can do the transfer.

445
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,090
估计需要多久  艾德
ETA on that, Ed?

446
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,390
不会太久  已经开始了
Not too long. It's coming.

447
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,300
接线有点困难
Wiring's a bit tricky.

448
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,870
双转子马达的线就在排线的中间
Spinner wires are in the middle of the ribbon.

449
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,910
-妈妈  我想走了  -我饿死了
- Mommy? I wanna go. - I'm starving.

450
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,770
梅琳
Maylene...

451
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,130
抱歉  我家里还有小坏蛋等我呢
I'm sorry, I got rascals of my own at home.

452
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:37,500
-黛比呢  -乔让她回去了  我要走了
- What about Debbie? - Joe sent her home. I gotta go.

453
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,360
好吧
Fine.

454
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,620
好了  有坚果  还有葡萄干
Okay, I've got nuts and raisins.

455
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,690
这就是今天的晚餐吗
That's what's for dinner?

456
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,080
老实吃就好了  行吗
Just eat it, okay?

457
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,600
-非洲的孩子还挨饿呢  -戈登
- Kids in Africa are starving right now. - Gordon...

458
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,760
继续吧  我们得把这事做完
Com on, we need to get this done.

459
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,850
如果你们想专心工作  我能帮忙照顾她们
Hey, I can take them if you guys wanna keep working.

460
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,920
不  不用  没事的  谢谢
No, no, no. We're good, thanks.

461
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,550
我们不需要你再"帮忙"了
We don't need any more of your help.

462
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,600
好吧  你要去哪
Well, where will you be?

463
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,210
停车库吧  就在消防门外
Uh, the garage, I guess, just outside the fire door.

464
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,880
好吧  小心点就是
Fine, all right? Just be careful.

465
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,210
那里有一部电话  有问题就打电话
There's a phone down there. Call if you got a problem.

466
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,090
我们都在这个房间  好吗
Okay, and we'll be right in this room, all right?

467
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:17,390
这是能让她们不加抱怨老实吃掉的晚餐
Here, dinner, which they will eat and not gripe about.

468
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,660
我相信她们会乖得像小天使一样
I'm sure they'll be little angels.

469
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:26,060
好消息是  我死掉前一定会先失明
The good news is I'll go blind before I die.

470
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,900
至少这样我就可以停下休息了
Then at least I'll have to stop.

471
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,960
他们会再给你拿一台显示器来
Well, the guys are bringing you down another monitor.

472
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,180
好了
There.

473
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,500
文件分配表  基本无损
There it is, the FAT. It's mostly intact.

474
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:40,170
-感谢上帝  -别激动  这需要时间
- Thank God. - Easy, now. It's a process.

475
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,210
你知道你工作的样子让我想起了什么吗
You know, watching you work, you know what it reminds me of?

476
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,480
你总在我工作的时候打扰我吗
How often you distract me when I'm trying to work?

477
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,380
记得那晚在计算机课上吗
That night in CS-50, remember?

478
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,030
大家都离开实验室了
When everybody had left the lab

479
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:03,110
然后你就在主板组装桌上把我推倒了
and you forced yourself on me on the motherboard assembly table.

480
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,160
我怎么记得不是这样
I recall it a little differently.

481
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,230
我们花了五天时间重组弄坏的主板
It took five days to rebuild the ones that broke

482
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,500
因为都被你扫到地上了
when you swept them to the floor.

483
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,430
是你把它们扫到了地上
You swept them to the floor.

484
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,050
紧急激情
Hey, romantic urgency.

485
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,950
是啊  我记得
Yeah, I remember.

486
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:25,000
唐娜  我很抱歉
Donna, I'm-- I'm sorry.

487
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,300
-好了  走开吧  我要工作了  -好吧
- Okay, now leave me alone. I gotta work. - Okay.

488
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,080
好吧  你们想试试痒痒喷雾吗
Okay, oh, do you want tickle spray?

489
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,260
好啊
Sure.

490
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,110
有个已经不在这儿工作的人
Some guy who doesn't work here anymore

491
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,030
把它落在桌子上了  我就偷来了
left it in his desk, so I stole it.

492
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,700
有人觉得恶心  但我们就尝尝看吧
Some people think it's yucky, but let's just try it.

493
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,510
准备好了吗
Okay, ready?

494
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,040
不好吗
No?

495
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,930
我觉得真正的挠痒更好  你觉得呢
I think real tickles are better, what do you think?

496
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,970
对吧  真正的挠痒更好吧
Right? Real tickles are good.

497
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,650
-你才不是渣滓  -没错  你很有趣
- You're not trash. - Yeah, you're fun.

498
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,040
怎么了  有人我说是渣滓吗
What? Did someone say I was?

499
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,430
没事  姑娘们  说吧
It's okay, girls. You can tell me.

500
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,610
爸爸跟妈妈说  你就是"白人渣滓"
Well, Dad said to Mom that you were just like white trash.

501
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,410
没错  他们在开玩笑
Yeah, they were joking.

502
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,610
你怎么知道他们在开玩笑
How do you know they were joking?

503
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,380
因为他们笑着说的
'Cause they were laughing.

504
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,540
继续玩吧  卡梅伦
Let's go play, Cameron.

505
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,700
你们想看点有趣的吗
You guys wanna see something fun?

506
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,480
走吧  游戏时间结束  找你们父母玩去吧
Okay, go. Playtime's over. Go play with your parents.

507
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,490
我们快走吧
Let's go.

508

{\an9}[驾照上有地址]

我以为乔让你离开了
I thought Joe told you to leave.

510
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,620
是的
Oh, he did.

511
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
但然后  我说通他了
But then we came to an understanding.

512

BIOS恢复得怎么样了
How's the BIOS recovery looking?

513
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,550
你的工程师也不愿跟我说话
Yeah, your engineers didn't want to talk to me either.

514
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,060
一群气冲冲的家伙
They're a prickly bunch.

515
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,930
我以为我一进去
I thought they were gonna try and crucify me

516
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,210
他们就会把我钉死呢
the moment I set foot down there.

517
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,880
现在你知道他们很聪明了吧
Now you know they're smart.

518
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,050
你肯定很不容易
Must be especially rough on you.

在这里工作了22年
I mean, 22 years here--

从卖二极管和无线电
selling diodes and ham radios...

00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,960
到大型机软件  现在变成这样
to mainframe software, to this?

522
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,950
你觉得内疚吗
You feeling any guilt

523
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:12,110
让一个IBM的骗子
letting some IBM slickster

524
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:15,540
来把你的一切成就抢走了
come in and hijack it all away from you?

525
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,010
首先  查清楚
First, check your facts.

526
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,680
我没被任何人抢走任何东西
No one hijacked anything from me.

527
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,480
其次  你觉得报道
And, second, you think your little story here

我们未能如愿的希望和破碎的梦想

that gonna revolutionize news reportin'?

最终不过又是一堆
Hell, just another wad of paper

你写你的"泰坦尼克号沉没"报道吧
But you go ahead and write your Titanic story,

533
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,640
说我们要毁了
the one where we go down.

534
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:47,060
但我告诉你  你们都该小心点
But I tell ya, y'all should be careful.

535
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,580
因为等我们搭建好这台个人电脑
Because when we build this PC,

536
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,600
所有人都会想来插一脚
everybody gonna wanna be in

537
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,810
而你
and you...

538
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,170
你只能远远看着
are gonna be outside standing there,

539
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,940
一点办法也没有
your little pecker wagging in the wind.

540
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:07,330
滚出我的办公室吧  省得我揍你
Now, you get out of my office before I punch you in the face.

541
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,480
我们好像恢复出来了
I think we got it.

542
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,360
该死
Damn it!

543
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,400
天呐
Oh, man.

544
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,620
他们也把你炒了吗
They fired you, too?

545
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,500
天呐  那边就跟恐怖电影似的
God, it's like a frickin' horror movie over there.

546
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:03,080
别怕  我只打坏人
Hey, oh, don't worry. I only shoot bad guys.

547
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,990
你是来报复的  对吗
Oh, oh, you're here for payback, huh?

548
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,630
伸张正义
Justice!

549
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,880
你要写什么  就一般那些话吗
What are you gonna write? The usual, huh?

550
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,160
写吧  动手吧
Okay, go ahead. Do it.

551
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,470
他们俩真虚伪  是吧
I mean, they're both such hypocrites, right?

552
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,480
唐娜总是高高在上  装什么职业女性
Nose-in-the-air Donna with her whole careerwoman act,

553
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:28,190
戈登  当自己是艺术家呢  得了吧
and Gordon, the artiste? Oh, please.

554
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,990
就好像他和那个什么乔
Like he and Joe what's-his-face

555
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:34,440
能创造一台能跟大巨头抗衡的个人电脑似的
are ever gonna create a PC to rival the big boys.

556
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,680
动手啊
Do it.

557
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:41,020
我发誓  我不会说出去的
I swear to God, I won't tell.

558
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,020
好了
We got it.

559
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,840
救得漂亮  危机逆转了
Nice save. Crisis averted, huh?

560
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,470
很幸运  文件分配表没有丢失
Well, we're just lucky the file allocation table wasn't lost.

561
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,380
我找到这个后  写了一个程序
Once I found that, I was able to write a program

562
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,660
重新整合数据扇区
to help reassemble the data sectors.

563
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,940
虽然还未完全恢复
She's not completely recovered,

564
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,760
但据我的计算  应该恢复了93%左右
but by my calculations, about 93%.

565
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:10,150
-你是  -苏珊·费尔柴德
- And you are? - This is, um, Susan Fairchild.

566
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,750
她是我们的调试员
She's one of our debuggers.

567
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,810
多谢了  苏珊  干得好
Thanks, Susan. Nice work.

568
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,980
伙计们  跟罗恩讲讲你们是怎么解决问题的吧
Hey, guys. How about showing Ron here how you cracked the problem?

569
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,680
这问题很棘手  是吧
You really got in deep there, right?

570
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,040
磁盘不是烧了吗
Okay, well, the magnetic platter melted, right?

571
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,960
转不了了  所以我们给装到新的转轴上了
And it couldn't be spun. So we remounted it.

572
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,990
-你是  -戈登·克拉克  首席工程师
- And you are...? - Oh, Gordon Clark, head engineer.

573
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,660
拜托  IBM毁了你们的大型机生意
No, no, but, come on. IBM decimated your mainframe business.

574
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,200
你们大幅度裁员
You laid off scores of employees.

575
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,930
你有足够资源和胆识
Have you got the resources, the guts,

576
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,110
在个人电脑领域竞争吗
to fight in the PC world?

577
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,920
罗恩  我们有三点
Ron, three things--

578
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,140
敏捷  设想  和毫无畏惧
nimbleness, vision, and a complete lack of fear.

579
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,410
IBM虽然厉害  但它大而僵
IBM's formidable, but it's gotten fat.

580
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,900
库房根本没有地毯
The storage room has no carpeting.

581
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,440
都是水泥地
It's concrete.

582
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:39,730
我不了解你  但要我就用拖把  而不是吸尘器
I don't know about you, but I'd use a mop, not a vacuum cleaner.

583
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,480
我把清洁工开除了  但如果你想  我可以...
I had the janitor let go, but if you want, I can call--

584
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,960
你真是不见棺材不掉泪啊
My God, you are tenacious.

585
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,380
这些磁盘的确消磁了
They were degaussed, all right.

586
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,740
但其中一个上面是电子数据表
But one of them had a spreadsheet on it.

587
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,560
另一个上面是游戏的一部分
Another, part of a game.

588
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,270
卡梅伦的确挺马虎  但还没到这个地步
Cameron's sloppy, but she's not that sloppy.

589
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,430
她会用干净的磁盘做备份  而不是这种的
She would've used clean disks to back up on, not those.

590
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,530
这是你一手操纵的
You engineered this.

591
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,360
你想办法把她骗出了屋子
You got her out of the room somehow,

592
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,310
你制造了电涌
you made the power surge happen,

593
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,850
但你随便找来了几块磁盘  对不对
but you grabbed a bunch of random disks, didn't you,

594
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:14,250
把他们消了磁  然后换走了卡梅伦的磁盘
and demagnetized them all before swapping them for Cameron's?

595
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,790
恭喜  被你发现了
Congrats, you got me.

596
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,700
如果我没能恢复BIOS代码呢
And if I hadn't recovered the BIOS?

597
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,100
我也会在凯恩离开之前自己挽救大局
I would've saved the day myself before Kane left the building.

598
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,840
你做了这么多  就为了宣传
All of this for a little publicity?

599
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,240
别低估宣传的价值
Don't underestimate it.

600
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,170
他今天来的时候  对我们的工作毫不感兴趣
He came in here today with zero interest in what we were doing.

601
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,460
现在  不论他写什么
Now, whether he writes that

602
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,610
是写我们是一群即将取得重大成就的天才
we're geniuses on the cusp of something great

603
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,520
或是一群差点毁于一旦的局外人
or misfits who almost crashed and burned,

604
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,080
但至少他会做报道
at least he'll write something,

605
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,920
现在  我们就需要这个
and right now that's all we need.

606
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,380
卡梅伦呢  你还在跟她上床呢
And Cameron, who's sleeping with you?

607
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,840
-她只是附带损伤吗  -她会迈过这个坎的
- She's just collateral damage? - She'll get over it.

608
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,170
而且她今后会更小心了
Plus, she's learned to be more careful. 

609
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,500
随便你怎么看我  唐娜
Look, you can think what you want about me, Donna.

610
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,760
但这也是他们的梦想  不只是我一人的
But this is their dream, too, not just mine.

611
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,920
我不希望他们对我的信任破碎
I'd hate to see their trust in me broken

612
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,200
就为了这么件有益无害的小事
over something so minor, so beneficial as this.

613
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,550
如果你够聪明  你显然是挺聪明的
If you're smart, and clearly you are...

614
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,960
就别告诉任何人  包括戈登
you won't tell anyone. Not even Gordon.

615
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,850
孩子们都没事  多谢关心了
The kids are fine. Thanks for asking.

616
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,480
你能安顿好他们吗
Hey, would you get them settled, please?

617
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,760
-什么  -我就来
- What? - Just-- I'll be there in a minute.

618
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,840
好
Okay.

619
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,700
你吓着我女儿了
You scared my girls.

620
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,490
我当时有事  抱歉
I had to leave, I'm sorry.

621
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:43,590
你是该觉得抱歉
You should be.

622
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,230
不知道你听没听说  我恢复了你的代码
I don't know if you heard, but I recovered your code.

623
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,770
没有全恢复  93.6%
Not all of it, but 93.6%.

624
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,710
谢谢
Thank you.

625
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:56,640
我之前对你说的话...
God, what I said to you--

626
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,380
算了  你当时很难过
No, forget it. You were a wreck.

627
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,880
而且也是情理之中
Makes sense you would be.

628
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,670
我还在上学的时候
One time when I was in school,

629
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,400
有次把可乐洒在了主板上
I spilled a whole Coke on my motherboard.

630
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,120
当时已经几周没做备份了
Hadn't backed up for weeks.

631
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,480
当时真想去跳海湾大桥
I felt like jumping off the Bay Bridge.

632
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:12,640
但我得说  我的代码
But I have to tell you, my code...

633
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,030
跟你的没法比
was never like yours.

634
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,680
你的代码
Yours is, uh...

635
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,390
简直像是音乐
well, it's like a piece of music.

636
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,660
回家吧  好好睡一觉  吃点像样的食物
You should go home. Sleep, maybe eat a real meal.

637
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,960
明天再干活儿
You can work tomorrow.

638
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,480
不  我要恢复剩下那6.4%
No, I gotta get back that 6.4%.

639
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,160
随你便吧
Suit yourself.

640
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,950
这是你的吗
Oh, are these-- are these yours?

641
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,110
戈登啊
Gordon.

642
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,930
是有点快了  是吧
Was a little fast, huh?

643
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,980
驾照和行驶证
License and registration?

644
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,660
你去够什么呢
Whoa, whoa, what are you reaching for?

645
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:34,340
只是拿驾照
Just getting my license out of the-- whoa, whoa.

646
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,570
你们干什么
What are you doing?

647
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,290
行了
All right, all right.

648
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,790
该死  他敢打我
Oh, shit. He hit me.

649
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,180
没有啊  什么
No, I-- what?

650
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,440
她们明天要没精神了
They're gonna be a mess tomorrow.

651
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,440
你是说两小时后吗
You mean in two hours?

652
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,960
今天真够呛
Man, what a day.

653
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,820
你真棒啊  真了不起
You were amazing. I mean, amazing.

654
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,550
苏珊·费尔柴德  我妈妈婚前的名字
Susan Fairchild? You give me my mother's maiden name?

655
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,370
我第一个想到的就是这个
It was the first thing I thought of.

656
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,220
你觉得我是我妈妈吗
So you think of me as my mother?

657
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,420
当然不是了
No, of course not.

658
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,050
别生气啊
You're being crabby.

659
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,370
我们都得去睡了
Come on, we both need to get to bed.

660
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,530
怎么
What?

661
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,430
怎么了
What?

662
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,300
是乔烧了卡梅伦的硬盘
Joe fried Cameron's hard drive

663
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,030
而且弄得好像是她把备份磁盘消磁了似的
and made it look like she degaussed her backups.

664
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,500
他是有意的
He did it on purpose 

665
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,700
就为了让那个记者报道你们
to try and get that reporter to write about you guys,

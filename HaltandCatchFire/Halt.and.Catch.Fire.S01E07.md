	但还是超过15磅了

	是因为多加的内存芯片和子板
	It's the extra RAM chips and the daughter board.
	我知道原因  有兼容损失吗

	It was a joke, okay? I'm sorry. Jesus.
	你知道我今天要开会
	You knew I had this meeting today.
	我先说吧

	真漂亮  我能说句话吗
	Yeah, it's a pretty girl. C-can I say something?
	参数发给你有一周了  你没看吗
	What happened to the specs that you've had for a week?
	我看了  但是它们局限性太强
	I saw them, but they were too limiting.
	不局限于参数  我们才有机会创造更好的东西
	Moving past the specs gives us an opportunity to make something,
	而不仅仅是一个米黄色长方块
	something that isn't just a beige rectangle.
	那些长方块耗费了数月的...
	Okay, those rectangles took months and months of--
	你觉得你可以大摇大摆地进来
	Do you think you can just waltz in here
	要求我们改变一切
	and demand that we change everything
	就只是因为你不喜欢它的外观吗
	'cause you don't like the way that it looks?
	-没错  -好吧
	- Yes. - Okay.
	我们会重新设计来满足你的要求
	Okay, well, we'll redesign the whole thing to fit the suit.
	我看到你给康塔什和德劳瑞恩做过设计

	Joe, this design will require another hardware overhaul.
	要花费上百小时
	I'm talking hundreds of hours.
	我们在散热方面是领先的

	people will be falling over themselves.
	等等  你管它叫什么
	Wait, the what?
	"尾迹"  我们要叫它"尾迹"
	The Contrail. We're calling it the Contrail.
	我这周会宣布  所以暂时保密
	I'm announcing it this week, so don't tell anyone.
	"尾迹"  你要用飞机喷出的尾气
	The Contrail? You're naming it after the exhaust
	来为它命名
	that comes out of the back of a plane?
	含义在于腾空而起  将竞争对手留在扬尘里
	It's about soaring, leaving the competition in the dust,
	这设计也正能做到这一点
	which is exactly what this design can accomplish.
	不  乔  尾迹就是指扬尘
	No, Joe, contrail is the dust.
	如果我们继续本末倒置
	Look, if we continue to put form ahead of function,
	被甩在后面遭人嘲笑的就会是我们
	we're gonna be the ones left behind with everyone laughing at us.
	你怎么不叫它...
	I mean, why don't you just call it--

	我为了这次会面解雇了另一个设计师
	I let another designer go just to take this meeting.
	-那女孩是怎么回事  -就因为这个吗

	我根本就不该来
	I never should've come.
	他走了  你满意了吗
	He's gone. Are you happy?
	就因为你不喜欢这个名字
	All because you didn't like the name?
	你想管它叫什么
	What did you want to call it?
	"巨人"吗  好  那就叫"巨人"
	The Giant? Fine. It's the Giant.
	我会让市场部扔掉设计从头开始
	I'll have marketing toss the art and start from scratch.
	除了要调整大小  设计大半用的是金属
	Hey, regardless of the resizing, half the design was metal.
	你希望每次把电脑放膝盖上
	You want your Armani pants to
	你阿玛尼的裤子就会着火吗
	catch on fire every time you put it in your lap?

	为什么  我们要给他们呈递99/4A的修改方案
	Why? We're bringing them fixes for the 99/4A.
	我们算是解决方案啊
	We're part of the solution.
	不知道公司会不会也这么想
	Well, not sure corporate sees it that way.
	这些修改的作用微乎其微
	These are Band-Aids on a sucking chest wound.
	那我们为什么不告诉他们实情呢
	Well, then why don't we tell them the truth?
	我倒是想  但我不想失去我的工作
	I would, but I'd also like to keep my job.
	-这个级别的高管  -去四层

	寄存器的内存只有256字节  这是个短板
	With only 256 bytes of RAM in the register, we have a bottleneck
	每次加载都需要等四个周期  让寄存器清空

	对不起  但是99没法一劳永逸地修好
	I'm sorry, but there are no once-and-for-all fixes for the 99.
	如果你真想解决问题
	If you want to do the right thing,
	就把它从我们的产品名录里去掉
	you drop it from our product list for good.
	她说得对
	She's right.
	我们还能做什么  再降价吗
	I mean, what are we gonna do, slash prices again?
	继续打折吗
	Hand out another rebate?
	我们几乎都是在白送了
	We're practically giving it away already.
	要我说
	If you ask me,
	我们就彻底退出个人电脑市场
	we get out of the PC market altogether.
	太对不起了  我不是故意插嘴的
	I am so sorry. I didn't mean to jump in--
	唐娜  他们讨论放弃99好几个月了
	Donna, they've been toying with dropping the 99 for months.
	只是没人敢真正说出口
	People are just too scared to say it out loud.
	-除了你  -等下  真的吗

	Shit, I don't need to give you a dollar.
	你会免费跳舞
	You'll dance for free.
	-你有邀请函吗  -什么  有
	- Do you have an invite? - Huh? Yeah.
	这他妈是什么
	What the hell is this?
	你个贱货
	You skank.
	你是拿我当司机呢  是吧
	You used me for a ride, didn't you?
	放松点  这里有免费的香槟酒
	Relax, there's free champagne.
	给你半小时  然后我就走人
	真苍凉
	Bleak.
	摄影师非常清楚
	I think the photographer understood very well
	这地方有多空旷
	how empty this place really is.
	可不是嘛  这是我家
	Tell me about it. I'm from here.
	抱歉了
	My apologies, then.
	彩虹仙子小姐今晚有何贵干呢
	So, what can I do for "Miss Rainbow Brite" This evening?
	{\pos(132,252)}卡通形象
	给我们做机箱
	Agree to build our case.
	你多大了
	How old are you?
	我已经能看出价值十万美金
	Old enough to see the difference between a $100,000 car
	只有少数人能买得起的车
	that only a fraction of the population can afford
	和五年之内所有人
	and a utility that every single human being
	都能与之交互的设备之间的区别
	will be interfacing with inside of five years.
	我明白乔为什么喜欢你了
	I can certainly see why Joe likes you.
	告诉他  派你作第二轮攻势真是漂亮
	Please tell him I said bravo for the very clever second push.
	不是乔派我来的
	Joe didn't send me.
	但我知道这对他很重要
	But I know this is important to him.
	是吗
	Important?
	乔怎么跟你说我的
	What did Joe tell you about me?
	我知道你俩搞遍了全欧洲什么的
	Look, I know you guys humped all over Europe or whatever.
	-我不在乎  -他这么说的吗
	- And I don't care. - Oh, is that how he put it?
	我记得可不是这样
	Because I seem to remember it fairly differently.
	-他说我离开他了吗  -说了
	- Did he tell you I left him? - Yeah, he did.
	说为什么了吗
	Did he tell you why?
	我告诉他我爱他
	Because I told him I loved him,
	一说出口我就知道完了
	and the moment I said it, I knew it was over
	所以第二天早上我就走了
	so I left the next morning.
	免得丢人
	I tried to spare myself the embarrassment.
	我们是有过好时光
	We did have quite a bit of fun for a while.
	纵情深夜
	Late nights.
	做了好多傻事
	Did a lot of stupid things, but
	乔后来大概是腻了
	in the end, I believe Joe just got bored.
	听我说
	Listen...
	我知道你觉得他对你不一样
	I know that you think what you have with him is different,
	但不要误以为
	but please don't make the mistake of thinking
	他最终不会也这么对你
	that he won't do the same thing to you eventually.
	走吧
	Come on, let's go.
	等会儿  我才刚拿到酒  过来
	Wait, I just got this one. Come here, come on.
	我们喝点香槟吧
	Hey, let's have some champagne.
	那是谁  前男友吗
	Who's that, an old boyfriend?
	什么  是啊
	Hmm? Yeah.
	看着就像个混蛋  他说什么了
	He looks like a real asshole. What did he say to you?
	没什么
	Nothing.
	手电筒拿稳点  专心点  姑娘们
	All right, hold the light steady. Come on, focus, girls.
	能玩点别的吗  玩点我们能赢的
	Can we play another game? Something we can win?
	跟我玩你赢不了的
	If you play me, you won't win.
	妈妈就没赢过我
	But Mommy never wins.
	那是她故意输给你
	That's because Mommy loses on purpose,
	那会教坏你们
	which is not a good life lesson.
	其实呢  看几点了
	In fact, look. Look what time it is.

	It's PJ time. You guys go get your PJs on.

	能在你床上讲故事吗
	Can we have our story in your bed?
	可以可以  走吧
	Yeah, fine. Fine, just go.
	-喂  -是我
	- Hello. - Hey, it's me.
	我之前打给你来着
	I-- I called.
	你还好吗
	Uh, is everything okay?
	不好
	No, everything's not okay.
	今天谈了机箱的设计
	We went over the case design again today
	乔又想让我
	and once again Joe wants me
	推翻重做  配合设计师
	to shift everything around inside to accommodate.
	重外表轻内在  我受够了
	It's style over substance and I'm tired of it.
	有人拿了个金属面板的机箱来
	Guy comes in and presents something with metal paneling,
	因为尺寸问题  散热器装不进去
	and because of the dimensions, the heat sink won't fit.
	那样回头得热的能当华夫饼铛了
	I mean, the thing's gonna end up being a waffle iron.
	尺寸我传真给你
	I'll fax you over the dimensions
	你看看有多荒唐
	so you can see how ridiculous it is.
	但这是可行的啊
	Wait, but that could work, couldn't it?
	用外壳来为主板散热
	Let the exterior paneling pull heat off the board?
	这主意还挺有意思的
	It's actually an interesting idea.

	很久以前  早在1800年间
	A long time ago, way back in the 1800s,
	纽约卡迪夫有个农民
	there was a farmer in Cardiff, New York.
	卡迪夫  跟你公司一样
	Cardiff, like your job.
	没错  这个农民
	Exactly. And this farmer,
	他想觉得自己很特别
	he wanted to feel special,
	于是他建造了一个10英尺的巨人
	so he built a 10-foot-tall giant
	并埋在了他的地里
	and buried it out in his field.
	他等了一年
	And he waited, and a year went by.
	然后他跟他的一些雇工把巨人挖了出来
	And then he and some of his workers dug it up.
	那些为他工作的人
	And the men who worked for him
	真以为那个巨人是真的
	were convied that the giant was real.
	于是  人们就劝他让世人看到这个巨人
	And the people told him to show it to the world,
	他就那么做了
	and he did.
	人们从四面八方赶来
	And people came from all around.
	他觉得自己好特别
	And he felt very, very special.
	他是那么特别
	He was so special
	甚至有人提出跟他搭档
	that somebody offered to partner with him.

	What happened?
	P.T.巴纳姆  建造了自己的巨人
	P.T. Barnum built his own giant.
	把它收入自己的马戏团
	And he made it part of his circus
	还说它是真的

	他推销技巧很高超
	And he was such an expert salesman
	结果大家都把农民忘了
	that everyone forgot about the farmer...
	他被遗弃了
	and he was left in the dust,
	淹没在尾迹里

1
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,310
爸爸
Daddy?

2
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,100
戈登  你没事吧  你在尖叫呢
Gordon, are you okay? You're screaming.

3
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,110
-什么  -你叫得很大声
- What? - You're screaming at the top of your lungs.

4
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,090
-妈妈  -几点了  你怎么起来了
- Mommy! - What time is it? Why aren't you in bed?

5
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,020
要写分析报告
This analysis report--

6
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,220
我周二要去卢博克市  必须把报告写好
I have to leave for Lubbock Tuesday and it has to be perfect.

7
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,650
我把孩子们吵醒了吗
Did I wake up the kids?

8
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,500
说不定把邻居都吵醒了
You probably woke the neighborhood.

9
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,820
-你真没事吗  -没事
- Are you sure you're okay? - Yeah.

10
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,410
宝贝们没事了  妈妈来了
Monkeys, it's okay. I'm coming.

11
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,580
我走之前要给你弄点晚饭吗
Can I get you some dinner before I take off?

12
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,390
都凌晨2点半了还能叫晚饭吗
Can you still call it dinner at 2:30 in the morning?

13
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,450
不用了  黛比  谢谢
I'm good, Debbie. Thanks.

14
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,510
我走之前要给你弄点晚饭吗
"Can I get you some dinner before I take off?"

15
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,200
-别闹  -她说得对  你得吃东西
- Oh, be nice. - She's right. You gotta eat.

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,420
你还说别人
Look who's talking.

17
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,450
只工作不玩耍的乔好无聊哦
All work and no play makes Joe a dull boy.

18
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,980
-肯定还有别的办法  -我们都试过了
- There's got to be another way. - We've tried everything.

19
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,710
-想想别的办法啊  -做不到
- Well, get more creative. - I can't.

20
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,730
再这么拆东墙补西墙
I move more things around,

21
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,370
这种状况就掩饰不住了
it's going to start to look bad.

22
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,700
会造成影响的
It'll be a problem.

23
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,040
个人电脑部的运营已经出现巨额赤字
Personal computer division is already operating at a massive deficit.

24
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,740
到了下周末
By close of business next week,

25
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,070
赤字进一步增长  会把整个公司拖下水
the hole will be so deep, it will take the entire company with it.

26
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,790
这事只有你知我知
You keep this between us.

27
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,910
明白吗
Do you understand?

28
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,110
我们不该在这儿吃东西
We shouldn't be eating in here.

29
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,030
我知道
I know.

30
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,420
我就喜欢看着它
I just like looking at it.

31
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,400
让我很性奋
It kinda turns me on.

32
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,750
是不是很怪
Oh, is that weird?

33
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,770
乔  那个通了电的
Joe, that's a live current.

34
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,910
只有几伏
It's only a few volts.

35
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,000
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

36
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,550
让你性奋
I'm turning you on.

37
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,470
来电话了
No, someone's calling.

38
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,400
现在可是凌晨3点
3:00 in the morning.

39
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,730
不  不  我非常高兴
No, no, I'm thrilled you'll do it,

40
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,350
我只是没想到你会回电话
I'm just surprised you called back.

41
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,100
我是给你留了言  但那是几周前的事了
I left you a few messages, but that was several weeks ago.

42
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,990
下周吗
Oh, next week?

43
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,780
我完全不知道他要在这儿开影展
I had no idea he was showing his photos here.

44
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,800
我很想去看
I'd love to see that.

45
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,310
我很想见你  跟你共事
I would love to see you, work with you on this.

46
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,080
6号吗  我很期待
Oh, the sixth. I'll look forward to that.

47
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,400
你最近怎么样
How have you been?

48
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,830
额外的内存空间和卡梅伦的扩展操作系统
Can't say I'm exactly happy about the extra memory

49
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,500
-我并不喜欢  -烤宽面条放在冰箱里了
- or Cameron's expanded O/S... - The lasagna is in the freezer.

50
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,710
放进烤箱加热之前
Don't forget to take it out

51
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,470
-别忘了拿出来解冻  -不过...
- and let it thaw before you reheat it in the oven. - You know,

52
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,550
这都过去了
that's the past.

53
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,820
-我们要向前看  -你要是需要
- We have to move on. - in case you need it

54
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,350
酒店的号码  就在冰箱上
the number for the hotel is on the fridge.

55
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,910
-戈登  听到了吗  -我知道大家怎么说
- Gordon, did you hear me? - I know what people are saying.

56
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,150
他们说我为软件妥协了
They're saying that I roll over for software.

57
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,820
-但事实是...  -戈登  看着我
- But the truth is-- - Gordon, look at me.

58
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,080
宽面条  冰箱  解冻  烤箱
Lasagna, freezer, thaw, oven,

59
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,670
电话在冰箱上  我知道了
number on the fridge. Got it.

60
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,570
质量检测会顺利的
Look, the QA tests, they're gonna go fine.

61
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,190
肯定有不如意之处
There's gonna be disappointment,

62
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,520
但我们要关注净收益
but we need to focus on the net gain here.

63
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,510
-他们得明白  -好吧
- They need to realize that... - Okay, 

64
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,490
你送孩子上学
so you're taking the kids to school,

65
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,090
你回来时萝丝就该到了
Rose will be here by the time you get back,

66
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,020
我明天中午回来
and I'll be home by noon tomorrow.

67
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,170
他们要明白  我每天都在那儿
What they need to realize is that I'm in there every day.

68
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,900
敦促乔  以搞到我们需要的东西
I'm pushing Joe to get what we need.

69
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,880
我也会想你的
I'll miss you, too.

70
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,060
有时候我们的思维会...
Sometimes our thoughts are often...

71
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,220
开机时间48.24秒
Boot time's 48.24 seconds.

72
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,380
48  上个月还是39秒呢
48? We were at 39 last month.

73
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,600
操作系统内存导致的  每次开机
OS memory requirements. I mean, the thing's basically

74
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,000
简直就是要600磅的人做蹲起
doing a 600-pound standing squat every time it turns on.

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,200
-系统反应时间呢  -403毫秒
- System response time? - 403 milliseconds.

76
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,040
这下多赫蒂阈值没了
There goes the Doherty Threshold.

77
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,130
-重量呢  -只重了几盎司
- Weight? - Only added a few ounces,

78
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,490
但还是超过15磅了
but it puts us over 15 pounds.

79
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,580
是因为多加的内存芯片和子板
It's the extra RAM chips and the daughter board.

80
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,090
我知道原因  有兼容损失吗
I know what it is. Loss in compatibility?

81
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,010
今天早上加载Lotus时没有反应
Tried to load Lotus this morning and it tanked.

82
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,420
那就是有了
I'd call that a big yes.

83
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,180
谈谈名字吧
All right, let's talk names.

84
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,960
软件部不负责命名吗
Oh, you mean software's not naming it?

85
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,660
我会把建议列成单子交给产品经理
I'm gonna take a list of suggestions to the product manager

86
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,860
到时讨论决定
and there's gonna be a discussion.

87
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,950
所以我们还是没机会嘛
So you mean we don't have a chance in hell.

88
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,920
对名字你们到底有没有想法
Do you guys have name suggestions or not?

89
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,460
好吧
Okay.

90
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,630
谢谢
Thank you.

91
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,180
你知道他要来都一周了
Well, if you knew this guy was locked for a week,

92
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,240
为什么今天才让我取消和肯尼的见面
why am I just cancelling Kenny today?

93
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,680
这太突然了  他不会高兴的
It's awful abrupt and he's not gonna be thrilled.

94
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,180
我的人喜怒无常  他是位艺术家
My guy's temperamental. He's an artist.

95
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,690
我们虽然通了几次电话
Despite our back and forth over the phone,

96
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,100
但我并不确定他会不会来
I wasn't even sure he would show up.

97
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,920
但他既然来了  就一定是答应了
But now that he's here, I know he's a yes.

98
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,390
-还有件事  -他说答应了吗
- There's something -- - He say that?

99
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,660
几个小孩入侵了
A bunch of teenagers broke into

100
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,140
洛斯阿拉莫斯国家实验室的电脑
Los Alamos National Lab's computers,

101
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,880
还有一个癌症中心和一家大银行
also into some cancer center and a big bank.

102
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,270
大多是用虚拟机操作系统的数字设备公司
Most were DECs running VMS OS.

103
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,600
都上封面故事了  太帅了
God, cover story and everything. Pretty cool.

104
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,560
你偷了我的车
You stole my car.

105
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,940
我只偷了你的钥匙
I stole your keys.

106
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,170
我把钥匙插进去时  车子自己启动了
The car just turns on when I put them in.

107
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,320
西蒙·丘奇  见到你真高兴
Oh, Simon Church. It's fantastic to see you.

108
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,470
谢谢你不辞辛苦来到这里
Thank you for making the trip all this way.

109
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,380
你对我和这个项目的意义无比重大
I can't tell you how exciting this is for us and the project.

110
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,890
是吗
Right.

111
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,680
我也很高兴
Hello to you, too.

112
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,850
很抱歉我迟到了  害你久等了
I'm sorry I'm late. I know I've kept you waiting.

113
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,800
但我还有点小事需要处理
I just have a few things to get in order.

114
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,190
你能不能在会议室等我们呢
Would you mind waiting for us in the conference room?

115
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,170
我都等不及要看看你的设计了
I can't wait to see what you've put together.

116
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,880
黛比
Debbie?

117
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,360
今天我们能成熟点吗  就几个小时
You think today maybe we could be adults? Just for a few hours?

118
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,470
是  长官  麦克米伦先生  长官
Uh, yes, sir, Mr. MacMillan, sir.

119
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,050
他是世界上最棒的工业设计师之一
He is one of the top industrial designers in the world.

120
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,160
如果他给我们做机箱  我们就能上一个档次
If he makes our case, it puts us on a whole new level.

121
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,190
只是开个玩笑  很抱歉行了吗  真是
It was a joke, okay? I'm sorry. Jesus.

122
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,950
你知道我今天要开会
You knew I had this meeting today.

123
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,780
我先说吧
I'll go first.

124
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,980
这样的轮廓  设计  角度  简直是
The contour, the design, the angles, it--

125
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,110
我只能赞叹  这正是我们想要的
All I can say is wow. It's exactly what we wanted.

126
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,160
很高兴能让你满意
So glad that I could accommodate.

127
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,150
我认为这做的很棒
I think this is something very special.

128
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,460
真漂亮  我能说句话吗
Yeah, it's a pretty girl. C-can I say something?

129
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,560
参数发给你有一周了  你没看吗
What happened to the specs that you've had for a week?

130
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,550
我看了  但是它们局限性太强
I saw them, but they were too limiting.

131
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,180
不局限于参数  我们才有机会创造更好的东西
Moving past the specs gives us an opportunity to make something,

132
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,410
而不仅仅是一个米黄色长方块
something that isn't just a beige rectangle.

133
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:29,770
那些长方块耗费了数月的...
Okay, those rectangles took months and months of--

134
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,790
你觉得你可以大摇大摆地进来
Do you think you can just waltz in here 

135
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,670
要求我们改变一切
and demand that we change everything

136
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,290
就只是因为你不喜欢它的外观吗
'cause you don't like the way that it looks?

137
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,030
-没错  -好吧
- Yes. - Okay.

138
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,690
我们会重新设计来满足你的要求
Okay, well, we'll redesign the whole thing to fit the suit.

139
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,620
我看到你给康塔什和德劳瑞恩做过设计
I saw that you worked on the Countach and the DeLorean.

140
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,620
{\pos(200,252)}均为汽车品牌

141
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,520
我告诉你吧
Let me tell you what I know.

142
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,070
这两种车都是修理店的常客
Both are in the shop every hundred miles.

143
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,020
没有人会在意
Nobody gives a damn about

144
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,690
电脑的外观  只要它好用就行
what the computer looks like as long as they work.

145
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,300
我来告诉你吧
Let me tell you what I know.

146
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,550
你的顾客很快就会有十几种可选电脑
Your consumers will soon have more than a dozen choices

147
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,660
看起来都和你造的电脑一样
that look identical to what you'd build,

148
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,020
那么用什么来吸引他们的注意力
so what will capture their attention?

149
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,490
是设计  让他们每次触摸你的机器时
A design that they will be magnetically drawn to

150
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,820
就被深深吸引
every single time they move to touch your machine.

151
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,480
乔  这设计需要我们彻底修改硬件
Joe, this design will require another hardware overhaul.

152
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,790
要花费上百小时
I'm talking hundreds of hours.

153
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,830
我们在散热方面是领先的
The one place that I'm ahead is heat.

154
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,200
如果我为此扔掉散热器...
If I ditch the sink for this, I run--

155
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,470
等我们推出"尾迹"  如果它是这个样子
When we unveil the Contrail and it looks like this,

156
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,690
人们会为它疯狂的
people will be falling over themselves.

157
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,860
等等  你管它叫什么
Wait, the what?

158
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,010
"尾迹"  我们要叫它"尾迹"
The Contrail. We're calling it the Contrail.

159
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,420
我这周会宣布  所以暂时保密
I'm announcing it this week, so don't tell anyone.

160
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,780
"尾迹"  你要用飞机喷出的尾气
The Contrail? You're naming it after the exhaust

161
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,410
来为它命名
that comes out of the back of a plane?

162
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,490
含义在于腾空而起  将竞争对手留在扬尘里
It's about soaring, leaving the competition in the dust,

163
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,040
这设计也正能做到这一点
which is exactly what this design can accomplish.

164
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,660
不  乔  尾迹就是指扬尘
No, Joe, contrail is the dust.

165
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,890
如果我们继续本末倒置
Look, if we continue to put form ahead of function,

166
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,290
被甩在后面遭人嘲笑的就会是我们
we're gonna be the ones left behind with everyone laughing at us.

167
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,450
你怎么不叫它...
I mean, why don't you just call it--

168
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,760
叫它"卡迪夫巨人"
call it the "Cardiff Giant"?

169
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,690
你向我保证过不会有问题
You assured me that everything was in line

170
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,980
不会浪费我的时间
and that my time wouldn't be wasted.

171
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,240
我没时间让你浪费
I don't have time to waste.

172
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,940
这是什么意思  我以为你是答应了
What is this? I thought this was a done deal.

173
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,200
你千里迢迢飞过来  现在却要走了吗
You fly out all this way and now you're leaving?

174
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,470
我为了这次会面解雇了另一个设计师
I let another designer go just to take this meeting.

175
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,680
-那女孩是怎么回事  -就因为这个吗
- What's with the girl? - Is that what this is about?

176
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,780
我根本就不该来
I never should've come.

177
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,990
他走了  你满意了吗
He's gone. Are you happy?

178
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,030
就因为你不喜欢这个名字
All because you didn't like the name?

179
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,810
你想管它叫什么
What did you want to call it?

180
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,320
"巨人"吗  好  那就叫"巨人"
The Giant? Fine. It's the Giant.

181
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,480
我会让市场部扔掉设计从头开始
I'll have marketing toss the art and start from scratch.

182
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,970
除了要调整大小  设计大半用的是金属
Hey, regardless of the resizing, half the design was metal.

183
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,070
你希望每次把电脑放膝盖上
You want your Armani pants to

184
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,730
你阿玛尼的裤子就会着火吗
catch on fire every time you put it in your lap?

185
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,170
我觉得  你不肯接受
I think you act like you can't see it

186
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,230
是因为你其实根本做不到
because the truth is you can't do it.

187
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,770
我看完了整本杂志  谢谢
I read a whole magazine-- thank you.

188
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,400
有人给我做早餐  有人给我女儿做早餐
Someone made me breakfast. Someone made my kids breakfast.

189
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,160
简直是翻天覆地的变化
It's a revolution.

190
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,460
你一定觉得我太嫩了...
You must think I am just the greenest--

191
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,130
不  现在都没人对出差这么兴奋了
No, no, no one I know gets excited about business trips anymore.

192
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,460
尤其是这趟差
Especially this trip.

193
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,180
为什么  我们要给他们呈递99/4A的修改方案
Why? We're bringing them fixes for the 99/4A.

194
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,140
我们算是解决方案啊
We're part of the solution.

195
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,190
不知道公司会不会也这么想
Well, not sure corporate sees it that way.

196
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,760
这些修改的作用微乎其微
These are Band-Aids on a sucking chest wound.

197
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,330
那我们为什么不告诉他们实情呢
Well, then why don't we tell them the truth?

198
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,780
我倒是想  但我不想失去我的工作
I would, but I'd also like to keep my job.

199
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,030
-这个级别的高管  -去四层
- Execs at this level... - Four, please.

200
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,320
他们只想听自己想听的  去八层
...they want to hear what they want to hear. Eight, please.

201
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,800
他们让我们作报告
They asked us to present the report,

202
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,450
我们照做就是了
so that's what we're gonna do.

203
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,290
我们先打扮一下  再玩椰菜娃娃
We can play dress-up and then play Cabbage Patch.

204
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,840
开个舞会
A dance party.

205
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,850
妈妈在冰箱里给我们留了烤宽面条
Mommy left lasagna in the freezer.

206
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,850
我们放进烤箱热上  然后玩椰菜娃娃
We could put it in the oven and then play Cabbage Patch.

207
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,120
或者积木  我们可以玩积木
Or blocks. We could play blocks.

208
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,480
没人能决定我们吃什么
No one's gonna tell us what to eat.

209
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,640
我们要自己做吃的
We are gonna make our own dinner all by ourselves.

210
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,050
-妈妈会生气的  -那我们吃什么啊
- Mommy's gonna be mad. - Daddy, What are we gonna eat?

211
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,410
妈妈现在不在
Mommy's not here.

212
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:19,630
{\an8}离婚诉求书

213
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,700
我们得把肯找回来
We need to get Ken back.

214
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,950
你在逗我吗
Are you shitting me?

215
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,320
计算机分销商展览还有6周  我们需要机箱
We have six weeks till COMDEX and we need a case.

216
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,420
你要是不希望我用垃圾袋包着机器亮相
Unless you want me to wrap the machine in a garbage bag,

217
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,750
我们就得找个设计师
we need a designer.

218
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,720
寄存器的内存只有256字节  这是个短板
With only 256 bytes of RAM in the register, we have a bottleneck

219
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,410
每次加载都需要等四个周期  让寄存器清空
that sets off a four-cycle wait to clear every time we load it.

220
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,230
-亨特  -而且功率调节器会过热
- Hunt-- - Plus a power regulator that gets so hot,

221
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,140
-用户都叫它"咖啡暖杯器"  -亨特
- users refer to it as the "coffee cup warmer." - Hunt,

222
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,780
你列出了很多问题
you're listing off a lot of problems,

223
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,860
那么解决这些问题也要花很多钱
and a lot of problems means a lot of money for fixes.

224
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,140
我们需要一劳永逸的办法
We need assurances that correcting these

225
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,280
一次性解决所有瑕疵
will solve the computer's flaws once and for all.

226
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,560
不可能的
Well, they won't.

227
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,360
对不起  但是99没法一劳永逸地修好
I'm sorry, but there are no once-and-for-all fixes for the 99.

228
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,310
如果你真想解决问题
If you want to do the right thing,

229
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,800
就把它从我们的产品名录里去掉
you drop it from our product list for good.

230
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,150
她说得对
She's right.

231
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,520
我们还能做什么  再降价吗
I mean, what are we gonna do, slash prices again?

232
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,600
继续打折吗
Hand out another rebate?

233
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,870
我们几乎都是在白送了
We're practically giving it away already.

234
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,530
要我说
If you ask me,

235
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,450
我们就彻底退出个人电脑市场
we get out of the PC market altogether.

236
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,680
太对不起了  我不是故意插嘴的
I am so sorry. I didn't mean to jump in--

237
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,720
唐娜  他们讨论放弃99好几个月了
Donna, they've been toying with dropping the 99 for months.

238
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,490
只是没人敢真正说出口
People are just too scared to say it out loud.

239
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,410
-除了你  -等下  真的吗
- Except for you. - Wait, really?

240
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,880
如果你没那么说
If you hadn't said that,

241
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,600
他们就不会直面事实
they never would've heard the truth.

242
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,360
-真有勇气  -真有傻劲还差不多
- That took guts. - I thought it took stupidity.

243
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,700
你就承认自己的功劳吧
Will you please just take the credit?

244
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,510
我们去楼下吃晚饭吧
Now, I say we meet downstairs for dinner,

245
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,810
当然是公费吃喝
on the company's credit card, of course,

246
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,130
好好庆祝一下我们的成功
and we celebrate a job well done.

247
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,400
7点见
7 o'clock?

248
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,470
好的
Yeah, okay.

249
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,700
她只能自己生火
She had to build her own fire...

250
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,010
自己拾柴
...and gather her own wood.

251
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,170
你好
Hello?

252
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,140
戈登  乔找你
Hi, Gordon. I've got Joe for ya.

253
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,030
但是1898年  艾瑞斯曾祖母
But in 1898, Great-Grandma Iris

254
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,040
在最后的淘金热时  拿了一些钱
picked up some stakes and ran off to the Klondike

255
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,890
去了克朗代克during the last great gold rush.

256
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,890
{\pos(202,252)}加拿大一处黄金产地

257
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,470
那时食物很少  得打猎煮饭
Food was scarce. You had to hunt and cook...

258
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,080
全靠自己  从零做起
...from scratch all on your own.

259
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:45,880
但是艾瑞斯曾祖母非常坚强
But Grandma Iris, she was tough.

260
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,150
她真的很坚强
She was real tough.

261
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,070
这就是她的祖传食谱
And this was her original recipe.

262
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,920
-你坚强吗  -不
- Are you tough? - No.

263
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,350
让她自己回答
Let her speak for herself.

264
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,230
过来
Come here.

265
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,380
让你姐姐瞧瞧你的志气
Show your big sister what you're made of.

266
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,080
-很好吃  爸爸  -是好吃
- It's good, Daddy. - It is good.

267
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,110
我也要一点  我也很坚强
I want some. I'm tough.

268
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,290
-很好吃  -因为你很坚强
- It's good. - 'Cause you're tough.

269
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,980
你也很坚强
And you're tough.

270
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,140
我们都很坚强
We're all tough.

271
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,970
我们能烤饼干吗  爸爸
Can we make cookies, Daddy?

272
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,150
妈妈有那种切下来直接进烤箱的饼干
Mommy has the cut-and-put-in-the-oven kind.

273
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,290
我们能一起玩游戏吗  爸爸
Can we play with you, Daddy?

274
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,900
我们很想跟你一起玩
We really want to play with you.

275
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,680
烤饼干可以  玩游戏可以
Yes to cookies, yes to games,

276
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,500
爸爸的美味炖汤也可以
yes to Daddy's wonderful stew.

277
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,050
你们去洗手吧
You guys go wash up.

278
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,710
看来你今晚不会去那什么摄影展了
I take it you're not going to the photography thing tonight?

279
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,610
不会了
No, actually.

280
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,210
我来换衣服  因为我要和约翰·博斯沃思
I came to change because instead I'm joining John Bosworth

281
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,160
还有肯·波克一起去"柔情爱抚"
and Ken Burke at "Strokers."

282
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,940
那是个名字惊艳的脱衣舞俱乐部
That's a strip club with an incredible name.

283
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,560
看来要用米黄色的机箱了
Beige box it is.

284
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,510
听着  我也不想如此
Look, it's not what I want, either.

285
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,420
要怪就怪戈登  他把一切都搞砸了
Blame Gordon. He blew it up.

286
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,380
你跟西蒙睡过吗
Did you sleep with Simon?

287
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,730
这种事情会困扰你吗
Is that something that would be a problem for you?

288
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,670
我完全不介意他是个男人
I don't give a shit that he's a man.

289
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,130
真的
Honestly.

290
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,270
十年前  我去欧洲参加一个会议
10 years ago, I was at a conference in Europe.

291
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,930
西蒙做了发言  我是听众之一
Simon spoke, I was in the audience.

292
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,140
他...
He was...

293
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,070
我想成为他那样的人
I wanted to be him.

294
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,200
我们一直待到会议结束
We stayed through the end of the event,

295
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,480
在接下来的一个月里游遍了欧洲大陆
traveled around the continent for the next month

296
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,420
然后
and then...

297
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,360
他离开了
he left.

298
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,670
就这样
That's it.

299
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,340
但他今天来你办公室来了
And yet he was in the office today.

300
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,180
他是个才华横溢的设计师
He's a brilliant designer.

301
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,110
我愿意忍受他
I was willing to put up with him

302
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,500
只要这对我们的工作有好处
if it meant something great for the work we've done.

303
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,080
但看来他不过是在玩我罢了
But I guess he was just stringing me along.

304
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,460
抱歉我今早对你发脾气了
I'm sorry I snapped at you earlier.

305
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,650
那家伙让我心神不宁
That guy just messes me up.

306
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,300
那个  给一美元她就肯跳舞
That one, she'll dance for a dollar,

307
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,950
做任何你要她做的事
do anything you like.

308
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,400
我可不会为一美元跳舞
I don't dance for a dollar.

309
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,230
你的报价很合理
Oh, your quote is perfectly reasonable

310
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,180
我们想继续谈了
and we'd like to move forward.

311
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,080
"报价"  价钱要涨了  要涨很多
My quote? It's gone up. Way up.

312
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,280
别这样  肯尼  我们也不是钱做的
Oh, come on, Kenny, man. We're not made of money here.

313
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,260
我们就想要个基本的注射模具
We're talking about a basic injection mold now.

314
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,230
我们俩在同一个圈子里混了好些年了
You and I have been in the same circles for years.

315
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,620
我一向非常敬重...
I've always had the utmost respect--

316
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,030
我们就走马观花地看  一眼就相中了你
We was window-shopping and decided you were the man to marry.

317
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,520
你们只是退求其次
Yeah, you're settling.

318
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,610
我想先受邀去参加舞会
See, I like to get asked to the prom first.

319
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,870
否则  我的感情就很受伤
If I don't, my feelings get hurt.

320
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,900
说到婚姻  靳妮最近怎么样了
Hey, speaking of marriage, how's Ginnie?

321
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,040
靳妮挺好的
Ginnie's doing just fine.

322
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,420
是吗  你做好后备打算了吗
Yeah? You line anything up on the side yet?

323
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,350
我们不是退求其次  而是重视实用性
We're not settling. We're betting on utility.

324
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,280
你的设计很简洁  很有接纳性
Your design is simple, it's welcoming,

325
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,570
没有大肆张扬  而我们想要的就是
it doesn't intimidate, and we want our machine to be...

326
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,350
亲民
friendly.

327
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:36,190
我都不用给你一美元
Shit, I don't need to give you a dollar.

328
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,200
你会免费跳舞
You'll dance for free.

329
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,790
-你有邀请函吗  -什么  有
- Do you have an invite? - Huh? Yeah.

330
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,220
这他妈是什么
What the hell is this?

331
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,250
你个贱货
You skank.

332
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,260
你是拿我当司机呢  是吧
You used me for a ride, didn't you?

333
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,360
放松点  这里有免费的香槟酒
Relax, there's free champagne.

334
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,770
给你半小时  然后我就走人
30 minutes and I'm leaving your skinny ass.

335
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,330
真苍凉
Bleak.

336
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,410
摄影师非常清楚
I think the photographer understood very well

337
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,260
这地方有多空旷
how empty this place really is.

338
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,100
可不是嘛  这是我家
Tell me about it. I'm from here.

339
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,590
抱歉了
My apologies, then.

340
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,030
彩虹仙子小姐今晚有何贵干呢
So, what can I do for "Miss Rainbow Brite" This evening?

341
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,030
{\pos(132,252)}卡通形象

342
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,750
给我们做机箱
Agree to build our case. 

343
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,610
你多大了
How old are you?

344
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,050
我已经能看出价值十万美金
Old enough to see the difference between a $100,000 car

345
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,620
只有少数人能买得起的车
that only a fraction of the population can afford

346
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,900
和五年之内所有人
and a utility that every single human being

347
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,110
都能与之交互的设备之间的区别
will be interfacing with inside of five years.

348
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,450
我明白乔为什么喜欢你了
I can certainly see why Joe likes you.

349
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,870
告诉他  派你作第二轮攻势真是漂亮
Please tell him I said bravo for the very clever second push.

350
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,220
不是乔派我来的
Joe didn't send me.

351
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,790
但我知道这对他很重要
But I know this is important to him.

352
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,800
是吗
Important?

353
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,470
乔怎么跟你说我的
What did Joe tell you about me?

354
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,740
我知道你俩搞遍了全欧洲什么的
Look, I know you guys humped all over Europe or whatever.

355
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,760
-我不在乎  -他这么说的吗
- And I don't care. - Oh, is that how he put it?

356
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,770
我记得可不是这样
Because I seem to remember it fairly differently.

357
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,180
-他说我离开他了吗  -说了
- Did he tell you I left him? - Yeah, he did.

358
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,420
说为什么了吗
Did he tell you why?

359
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,410
我告诉他我爱他
Because I told him I loved him,

360
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,810
一说出口我就知道完了
and the moment I said it, I knew it was over

361
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,580
所以第二天早上我就走了
so I left the next morning.

362
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,210
免得丢人
I tried to spare myself the embarrassment.

363
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,990
我们是有过好时光
We did have quite a bit of fun for a while.

364
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,920
纵情深夜
Late nights.

365
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,680
做了好多傻事
Did a lot of stupid things, but

366
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,100
乔后来大概是腻了
in the end, I believe Joe just got bored.

367
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,290
听我说
Listen...

368
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:52,110
我知道你觉得他对你不一样
I know that you think what you have with him is different,

369
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,240
但不要误以为
but please don't make the mistake of thinking

370
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,200
他最终不会也这么对你
that he won't do the same thing to you eventually.

371
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,400
走吧
Come on, let's go.

372
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,570
等会儿  我才刚拿到酒  过来
Wait, I just got this one. Come here, come on.

373
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,760
我们喝点香槟吧
Hey, let's have some champagne.

374
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,270
那是谁  前男友吗
Who's that, an old boyfriend?

375
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,480
什么  是啊
Hmm? Yeah.

376
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,730
看着就像个混蛋  他说什么了
He looks like a real asshole. What did he say to you?

377
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,860
没什么
Nothing.

378
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,600
手电筒拿稳点  专心点  姑娘们
All right, hold the light steady. Come on, focus, girls.

379
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,240
能玩点别的吗  玩点我们能赢的
Can we play another game? Something we can win?

380
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,860
跟我玩你赢不了的
If you play me, you won't win.

381
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,740
妈妈就没赢过我
But Mommy never wins.

382
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,820
那是她故意输给你
That's because Mommy loses on purpose,

383
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,630
那会教坏你们
which is not a good life lesson.

384
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,610
其实呢  看几点了
In fact, look. Look what time it is.

385
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,170
睡衣时间到  快去穿睡衣
It's PJ time. You guys go get your PJs on.

386
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,830
你们刷完牙我就去
All right, as soon as you brush your teeth, I'll come in there.

387
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,180
能在你床上讲故事吗
Can we have our story in your bed?

388
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,560
可以可以  走吧
Yeah, fine. Fine, just go.

389
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,980
-喂  -是我
- Hello. - Hey, it's me.

390
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,240
我之前打给你来着
I-- I called.

391
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,140
你还好吗
Uh, is everything okay?

392
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,420
不好
No, everything's not okay.

393
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,300
今天谈了机箱的设计
We went over the case design again today

394
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,410
乔又想让我
and once again Joe wants me

395
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,550
推翻重做  配合设计师
to shift everything around inside to accommodate.

396
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,100
重外表轻内在  我受够了
It's style over substance and I'm tired of it.

397
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,890
有人拿了个金属面板的机箱来
Guy comes in and presents something with metal paneling,

398
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,340
因为尺寸问题  散热器装不进去
and because of the dimensions, the heat sink won't fit.

399
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,820
那样回头得热的能当华夫饼铛了
I mean, the thing's gonna end up being a waffle iron.

400
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,190
尺寸我传真给你
I'll fax you over the dimensions

401
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,360
你看看有多荒唐
so you can see how ridiculous it is.

402
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,700
但这是可行的啊
Wait, but that could work, couldn't it?

403
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,040
用外壳来为主板散热
Let the exterior paneling pull heat off the board?

404
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,870
这主意还挺有意思的
It's actually an interesting idea.

我得挂了
I have to go.

409
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,820

Daddy, we have our PJs on!

410
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,910
来啊
Come on.

411
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,970
说到底
At the end of the day,

412
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,520
我们还是很高兴能跟你们合作
we're happy to be doing business with y'all.

413
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,390
我们会设计好机箱的
We'll get you a case.

414
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,070
多谢了  肯尼
Well, I appreciate that, Kenny.

415

The pleasure's ours.

00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,340
尽快做个塑料模型出来  好吗
Get that plastic mold fired up ASAP, huh?

417
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,120
你们出了那么多钱
We figure with the amount of money you're spending,

418
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,070
我可以先做你们的
I can bump you to the top of the list.

- Long week. - Hurts, don't it?

422
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,570
至少我们玩得挺尽兴
Well, at least we got to have a good time

423
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,360
花的还是卡迪夫的钱
on Cardiff's dime, though, right?

424
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,540
-是啊  -好好玩  肯尼
- Yeah, sure. - Have a good one, Kenny.

Hey, you know, we must'a seen 20 pretty titties.

426
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,410
你脸上却一个笑容都没有
Not so much as a smile from you.

427
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,760
你是基佬吗
What, are you queer?

428
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,190
你这是袭人  约翰  我要告你
That is assault, John! I will press charges.

听着没
You hear me?

没事  我没事  别碰我
All right. I'm good, I'm good. Get your hands off me.

432
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,310
你还能跟你朋友谈拢吗
Can you still make it work with your guy?

433
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,380
我去试试
I can try.

435
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:26,780
很久以前  早在1800年间
A long time ago, way back in the 1800s,

436
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,070
纽约卡迪夫有个农民
there was a farmer in Cardiff, New York.

437
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,380
卡迪夫  跟你公司一样
Cardiff, like your job.

438
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,340
没错  这个农民
Exactly. And this farmer,

439
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,400
他想觉得自己很特别
he wanted to feel special,

440
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,150
于是他建造了一个10英尺的巨人
so he built a 10-foot-tall giant

441
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:43,050
并埋在了他的地里
and buried it out in his field.

442
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:47,710
他等了一年
And he waited, and a year went by.

443
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:52,210
然后他跟他的一些雇工把巨人挖了出来
And then he and some of his workers dug it up.

444
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,220
那些为他工作的人
And the men who worked for him

445
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,930
真以为那个巨人是真的
were convied that the giant was real.

446
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,250
于是  人们就劝他让世人看到这个巨人
And the people told him to show it to the world,

447
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,580
他就那么做了
and he did.

448
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,540
人们从四面八方赶来
And people came from all around.

449
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:16,630
他觉得自己好特别
And he felt very, very special.

450
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,490
他是那么特别
He was so special

451
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,740
甚至有人提出跟他搭档
that somebody offered to partner with him.

455
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,880
他们每天都会争执不休
And they fought and they argued day and night

456
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,580
因为那个推销员
because the salesman 

457
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,720
想把巨人占为己有
wanted the giant all to himself.

458
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:46,620
后来呢
What happened?

459
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,410
P.T.巴纳姆  建造了自己的巨人
P.T. Barnum built his own giant.

460
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,740
把它收入自己的马戏团
And he made it part of his circus

461
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,110
还说它是真的
and he claimed that it was real.

462
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,170
他推销技巧很高超
And he was such an expert salesman

463
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,030
结果大家都把农民忘了
that everyone forgot about the farmer...

464
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,310
他被遗弃了
and he was left in the dust,

真没想到啊

因为我们说好的
Because we made a deal.

480
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,180
我们说好  如果他做这个
We agreed that if he did this

481
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,220
结果不会像上次那样
that it wouldn't turn out like last time,

482
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,070

"歇菜吧  保佑你"
"Good night and God bless."

539
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,950
等没钱了  你就叫停项目
Once the last dime goes, you shut it down.

540
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,890
振作起来  约翰
Pull yourself together, John.

541
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,110
回家到你妻子身边去吧
Go home to your wife.

542
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,960
你知道我见到你的时候  内心渴望什么吗
The moment I met you, you know what I longed for?

543
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,600
有一日我们能合作
The day when we would get to work together,

544
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,830
我们能有配得上你的产品
when we finally had something that would be worthy of you.

545
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,490
你觉得便携IBM克隆机就是了吗
And that thing is a portable IBM clone?

546
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,710
乔  多谢你这么恭维我
Joe, I appreciate the blanket flattery,

547
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:52,150
但有点晚了吧
but it's a little too late, isn't it?

548
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:56,010
我不懂  你为什么打给我
I don't get it. Why call me?

549
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,340
你为什么要重新闯入我生活中
Why come back into my life at all?

550
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,390
我记得杰瑞米说要离开纽约
I remember when Jeremy said he was leaving New York

551
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,890
来这儿待一年的时候
to come spend a year here.

552
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,830
他说是要"游历大平原"
"Tour the Great Plains," He said--

553
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,880
俄克拉荷马  德克萨斯  堪萨斯
Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas.

554
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,680
要"拍摄风景"  什么风景啊
"Photograph the landscape." What landscape?

555
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,830
我们都以为他是疯了
I mean, we all thought he'd gone mad.

556
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:16,510
但我还是来了  想看看他口中的风景
But here I am trying to see what he was talking about,

557
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,980
他拍摄的照片
looking at his pictures,

558
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,290
并努力搞清楚你为什么要搬到这儿来
and trying to to figure out why you moved here.

559
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,950
我告诉你  平等机会  公平竞争环境
I'll tell you why. Equal opportunity, a level playing field--

560
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,590
乔  得了  你那个神童
Joe, please. I already got the hard sell

561
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,250
已经向我推销过这一套了
from your wunderkind over there.

562
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,050
真是年轻一代啊  乔
Truly the future generation, Joe.

563
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:33,580
她真像当年的你
She actually reminds me of you at that age.

564
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,360
我当时远远不如她
She's light-years ahead of where I was then.

565
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,970
她是未来  这对我们都有益处
She is tomorrow, and we're all better off because of it.

566
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,190
说到底  我们选择谁的设计并不重要
In the end, it doesn't matter what design we choose

567
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,910
因为机器里面的东西才是天才
because it's what's inside the machine that's brilliant.

568
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:48,840
那是她做到的  不是你  不是我
She did that. Not you, not me.

569
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,760
你做不做机箱  我不在乎
Do the case, don't do the case. I don't care.

570
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,030
放开我  大神探
Get off me, "Kojak." Ow!

571
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,540
行了  过来  过来
All right. Come here, come on. 

572
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,320
-振作点  -抱歉
- Get a hold of yourself. - Sorry.

573
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,150
那家伙让我心神不宁
"That guy just messes me up."

574
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,170
等等  好了
Oh, wait a minute. There we go.

575
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,630
你替那个钢琴师挣的小费
You know, you probably made that piano player

576
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,960
大概比他一年的工资还多
more in tips than he makes in a whole year...

577
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,470
苏珊·费尔柴德
"Susan Fairchild."

578
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,520
等等  我好像见过这名字
Wait a minute, I think I know that name.

579
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,580
那是我妈妈婚前的名字
Oh, that's my mother's maiden name.

580
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,210
你大概听过
You probably heard it around.

581
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,630
不是  好像是在哪份报刊上看到的
No, actually, I think I read it somewhere.

582
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,210
你应该经常做苏珊·费尔柴德
You should be "Susan Fairchild" more often.

583
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,300
她挺有意思的
She's fun.

584
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,890
能跟你说句比较私人的话吗
Can I tell you something personal?

585
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,050
你多做了份报告  才来参加这个会议
Doing that extra report got you here.

586
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,380
你向高管说不
Saying no to those execs

587
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,520
改变了我们的汇报
changed our whole presentation.

588
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,330
让人们看到真实的你
Showing people who you really are,

589
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,450
你应该经常这么做
you should do that more often.

590
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,120
大胆一点
Be bolder.

591
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,930
6点楼下见  我们去赶飞机
I'll see you downstairs at 6:00 for our flight.

592
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,880
我们能找到巨人吗
Will we find the giant?

593
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,720
肯定很接近了
I'm sure we're close.

594
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,120
我们得挖深一点
We have to dig deeper, come on.

595
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,740
已经很深了
We're very deep.

596
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:43,370
天呐  我好像挖到条虫子
Oh, my gosh. I think I found a worm.

597
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,340
是吗  我们给它起什么名字
You did? What should we name it?

598
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,500
笑笑
Smiley? 

599
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,630
姑娘们  你们干什么呢
Girls, what are you doing?

600
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,150
挖巨人
Digging for the giant.

601
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,480
小可爱们  那不是真的
No, honey, it's not a real giant.

602
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,130
对他来说是真的  是你说的
It was real to him. You said so.

603
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,200
亲爱的  你们得进去了  要不你们妈妈...
Sweetheart, you gotta get inside or your mother--

604
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,350
没事  爸爸  我们能找到巨人的
Don't worry, Daddy. We'll find the giant.

605
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,820
亲爱的  那只是个故事
Sweetie, it's just a story.

606
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,070
我给你看
Okay, look, I'll show you.

607
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,680
看  没有巨人
See? No giant.

608
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,930
爸爸  你手怎么了
Daddy, what happened to your hand?

609
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,670
爸爸  你没事吧
Daddy, are you okay?

610
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:24,820
你们待在这里
You guys stay here. 

611
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,960
我就回来
All right? I'll be right back. 

612
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,430
我找给你们看
I'm gonna show you.

613
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:59,840
我必须下来一趟...
I just had to come down. I was--

614
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,440
你这是干什么
Whoa, whoa, what-- what are you doing?

615
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,250
你让我大胆些
You said "Bold."

616
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,080
你说...
You said-- wasn't--

617
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,520
我是来给你传真
I came to bring you a fax.

618
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,530
酒店误把这个拿给我了
Um, the hotel delivered it to my room by mistake.

619
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,160
应该是你丈夫发来的
I think it's from your husband.

620
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,160
天呐
Oh, my God.

621
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,190
真抱歉
I am so sorry.

622
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,670
你一定觉得...
I-- you must think that--

623
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:36,160
不不  这种事也常有
No, no, no. No, look, these things happen, okay?

624
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,900
一起工作的人
Look, people-- people work together

625
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,890
难免会产生...
and they develop, uh, you know--

626
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,910
只是一般不会采取什么行动
they just-- they don't usually act on them.

627
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,570
晚安
Look-- have a good night.

628
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,660
喂
Hello?

629
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,820
还有哪家租车行开着吗
Um, are there any rental car places still open?

630
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,390
是的  现在  我得回家
Yes, now. I need to go home.

I need you to swing by my office first thing in the morning.

634
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,230
谢谢
Thank you.

635
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,130
我就来
I'll be a minute.

636
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,960
事情并不如我们所愿
This didn't turn out the way either one of us had hoped.

637
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,350
我只是想再见见你  乔
I just wanted to see you again, Joe.

638
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:57,220
跟你待在一起  跟你合作
Spend some time with you really working on something.

639
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,890
结果却发现你跟她在一起
Then I come to find you're with her.

640
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:01,640
是啊  我是跟她在一起
Yes, I'm with her.

What we had was 10 years ago, Simon.

642

别再留恋过去了
Stop living in the past.

643
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,230
你现在何必还在意那些
Why bother with any of that now?

644
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,780
我病了
I'm sick.

645
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,890
我是来道别的
I just came to say goodbye.

646
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:38,890
你不问问吗
Aren't you gonna ask?

647
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,300
问什么
What?

648
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,150
你还会不会做机箱
If I'm still gonna do the case?

649
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,650
我了解你  乔  我知道你还在考虑
I know you, Joe. I know you're thinking it.

650
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,320
我上飞机之前就设计好了
I set it up before I even got on the plane.

651
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,000
我希望你知道
I need you to know that 

652
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,100
你对我的感觉
the way you felt about me,

653
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,470
我也想...
I wanted to--

654
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:12,010
保重
Take care of yourself.

655
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,760
走吧
Go.

656
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,960
你也会对我感到腻吗
Are you gonna get bored of me?

657
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,520
我不知道
I don't know.

658
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,960
天呐  宝贝
Oh, my God. Baby?

659
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,760
出什么事了  爸爸呢
Baby, is everything okay? Where's Daddy?

660
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,070
我们刚刚在院子里挖地
We were in the back yard digging.

661
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,280
好吧  去睡吧

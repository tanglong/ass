1
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,590
人之表象
Everything that you conceive of yourself as being

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,020
皆为虚妄
is an illusion.

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,560
自我亦为虚妄
There is no self.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,100
深吸一口气
Take a deep breath in.

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,510
感触万物
Allow yourself to experience everythingness

6
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,380
一切皆空
and nothingness.

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,510
呼气  摒弃恐惧
As you breathe out, let go of fear.

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,650
超脱俗世
You can choose to leave the familiar...

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,690
我没事
I'm fine.

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,470
或安于遗忘
...or stay in the safe oblivion

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,350
-痛苦  无知  -唐娜
- of pain, ignorance... - Donna.

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,720
-抱歉  抱歉  -和空虚
- Sorry. I'm sorry. - and a blank page.

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,010
-我们需要很多冰鲜虾  -两千块
- We need a lot of shrimp on ice. - $2,000?

14
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,830
最好是白对虾
Gulf white, preferably.

15
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,560
不要冻的  大家会尝出来的
And not frozen 'cause people will know.

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,670
花两千块买虾
But two grand for shrimp?

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,360
你要把人淹没在虾海里吗
What, are you gonna try to drown someone in 'em?

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,670
-太疯狂了  -想大展拳脚的公司
- It's crazy. - Anyone who means anything

19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,580
都会开个丰盛的派对
throws a lavish party.

20
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,540
而在展览会  虾就是丰盛的代名词
At COMDEX, lavish equals shrimp.

21
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,760
-我们租到好展位了吗  -正在办
- Did we get a decent booth location? - I'm on hold right now.

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,520
-展位要花多少  -一万八
- Well, how much is that gonna cost? - 18 grand.

23
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,310
你不问我一堆问题吗
You're not gonna ask me 50 questions?

24
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,700
这点钱就吓住你了吗
You gonna blow the balls off the numbers?

25
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,600
是啊  喂  你好
Yes, sir. Yes, hello.

26
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,590
没错  27号到2号  抱歉  能稍等下吗
That's correct. 27th through the 2nd. I'm sorry, can you hold?

27
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,650
梅琳  这部电话也有静电干扰
Maylene, this phone is clicking now, too.

28
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,860
-你能找人来修修吗  -好的
- Can you get someone in here to fix it? - Yes, sir.

29
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,300
喂  抱歉久等  是几号展位
Hello, sorry about that. What is it?

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,610
C23  谢谢
C-23. Thank you.

31
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,920
康懋达  坦迪公司  卡迪夫电子
Commodore, Tandy, Cardiff Electric.

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,970
太棒了  太棒了
That is huge, that is huge.

33
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,200
那地方可大了  我去过
It's so big, I'm telling you. I've been there.

34
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,080
你还好吧
You all right?

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,760
你去不成展览会不失望吗
You're not upset about COMDEX?

36
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,440
什么
What?

37
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,090
我为什么会想去展览会
Why would I want to go to COMDEX?

38
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,050
不都是推销员去吗
It's just for salesmen, right?

39
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,150
他们开机就能看到我的作品
They can just turn it on to see what I did.

40
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,330
也是
True.

41
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,470
我走了会想你的
You know, I'll miss you while I'm there.

42
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,660
我也是
Yeah, me, too.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,360
你告诉戈登了吗
You tell Gordon yet?

44
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,290
一直拖着没说  你觉得他会生气吗
I keep putting it off. You think he'll be upset?

45
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,370
戈登·克拉克吗
Gordon Clark?

46
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,210
计算机分销商展览
COMDEX.

47
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,290
-真是太棒了  对吧  -你说是就是咯
- Pretty amazing, huh? - I'll take your word for it.

48
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,290
真的很难跟没去过的人解释清楚
Well, it's hard to explain if you haven't actually been there.

49
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,660
我不想夸大其词
I mean, I don't want to oversell it or anything,

50
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,830
不过真的很壮观
but it is spectacular.

51
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,130
今年会有一千多个展位
There's gonna be over a thousand booths this year.

52
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,670
所有大人物都会到场
All the heavy hitters show up.

53
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,390
史蒂夫·乔布斯  比尔·盖茨  米切尔·卡普尔You got Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mitch Kapor, you know?

54
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,390

{\pos(192,252)}微软

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,390
{\pos(282,252)}莲花软件

57
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,530
IBM包下两层酒店房间  还有派对
IBM takes over two hotel floors, and the party scene--

58
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,390
派对简直难以置信
the party scene is unbelievable.

59
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,940
我和唐娜81年去的时候
Donna and I were there in '81,

60
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,310
从顶楼开始  一路逛下来
we started at the penthouse and worked our way down,

61
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,150
把每个有像样展位的公司的派对都逛了一遍
hitting every corporate party with decent booths.

62
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,850
你在诺威克酒店给我们订了房间  对吧
You got us rooms at the Norwick, right?

63
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,040
住那里很重要
'Cause staying there is key,

64
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,650
否则排队等出租车就得等一个礼拜
otherwise you spend the whole week waiting in line for a taxi.

65
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,200
相信我  我有经验
Trust me, I know.

66
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,110
当时可真是不堪回首
I learned the hard way.

67
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,170
等等  你也要去吗
Wait, are you going, too?

68
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,840
乔说只需要一间房
Joe said he only needed one room.

69
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,360
你不带我去展览会吗
You're going to COMDEX without me?

70
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,770
抱歉  决定那会儿你病了没来上班
I'm sorry. It was arranged the week you were out sick.

71
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,180
-我忘了告诉你  -少骗人了
- I forgot to tell you. - Bullshit you forgot to tell me!

72
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,200
卡梅伦也不会去
Cameron's not going either.

73
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,360
卡梅伦也不去就行了是吧
Oh, well, if Cameron's not going, then all right, then.

74
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,620
你没必要去的
Look, it's not like your role is essential.

75
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,610
是啊  我只是造出了那东西而已  乔
Yeah, I only built the damn thing, Joe.

76
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,570
展览会是要推销电脑  那是我的专长
COMDEX is about selling it and that is my area of expertise.

77
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,720
演示怎么办  系统出故障了怎么办
What about the demo? What if there's a glitch in the system?

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,600
就像你推出交响乐时那样吗
Like when you debuted the Symphonic?

79
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,870
我本不想提这事
I was trying to avoid bringing it up,

80
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,830
但大家还记得81年发生了什么
but the fact is, people still remember what happened in '81.

81
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,470
我不能让那事影响潜在的买家
I can't afford to have the stink from that distracting potential buyers.

82
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,430
但如果我需要故障检修  一定先打给你
But if I need any troubleshooting, you're my first call.

83
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,390
我这几个月拼死拼活
I didn't kill myself all these months

84
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,280
可不是为了让你摘果子
for you to get all the glory with the Giant.

85
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,220
周一C23展位我是去定了
You plan on seeing me at booth C-23 on Monday.

86
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,370
呼气  摒弃恐惧
...breathe out, let go of fear.

87
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,750
超脱俗世...
You can choose to leave the familiar or stay...

88
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,680
亨特
Hunt?

89
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,120
你来这儿干什么
What are you doing here?

90
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,310
唐娜
Donna, hey.

91
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,990
-你在外面站多久了  -就一会儿
- How long have you been out here? - Not long.

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,470
我只是...
I was just, um...

93
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,400
-我不该来的  -不  我只是...
- This was a mistake. - No, no. I just--

94
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,100
我以为卢博克市那事之后...
I thought after Lubbock that--

95
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,320
我不该来这儿
I shouldn't be here.

96
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,440
你能当作没在这儿见过我吗
could you just forget you ever saw me?

97
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,670
当然  不用担心
Of course. You don't have to worry.

98
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,000
但你真的不能再这么跑来了
But you really can't show up like this.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,270
我明白  不会再发生这种事了
I know, it won't-- it won't happen again.

100
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,650
我保证
I promise.

101
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,810
唐娜  我希望你知道
Donna... I want you to know

102
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,480
我认为你是个了不起的女人
I think you're an amazing woman.

103
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,590
一切都还好吧
Everything all right over there?

104
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,720
不久前看到你们挖开了后院草坪
Noticed you guys had to dig up your back lawn a while back, 

105
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,170
全部重铺了
resod everything.

106
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,180
我只是想确认下不是因为出现了
Just wanna make sure there's not some sort of ugly weed

107
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,740
我需要留意的讨厌杂草
I need to look out for.

108
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,030
没有  天气太热有部分草死了
Oh, uh, no. The heat killed off some patches.

109
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,930
我们没浇够水
We just didn't water enough.

110
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,870
这样
Oh, yeah.

111
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,820
唐娜
Donna?

112
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,730
我需要和你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

113
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,400
我知道我们约定过
Look, I know we promise

114
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,450
任何大于50的支出都要预先讨论
to discuss any purchases over $50,

115
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,310
但在你爆发前  我想说这次是紧急情况
but before you explode, this was an emergency situation

116
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,480
我当时必须马上采取行动
and I had to act fast.

117
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,720
什么紧急情况
What do you mean, emergency?

118
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,420
乔要撇下我自己去参加计算机分销商展览
Joe's trying to box me out of COMDEX

119
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,330
我不用跟你说他有多阴险
and I don't have to tell you what a snake he is,

120
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,150
拉斯维加斯主街上只剩下一间空房
but there was only one room left on the Strip

121
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,210
飞往那儿的航班也爆满
and flights to Vegas were shooting up.

122
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,230
我不得不用我们的信用卡透支了455美元
I had to put the $455 charge on our credit card.

123
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,710
我只是...我必须得去
I just-- I have to be there.

124
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,120
既然你需要  那就花吧
Whatever you need to do.

125
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,890
你确定
Oh, are-are you sure?

126
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,480
唐娜  你最好了
Donna, you're the best.

127
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,140
天呐  谢谢你
Oh, my God. Thank you.

128
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,170
我要去看看我该带哪套西装了
Oh, I gotta figure out what suit I need to bring.

129
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,810
我知道你觉得我穿蓝色好看
Look, I know you think I look good in blue,

130
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,690
但我可不想被人当做是IBM的人
but I don't want to risk anyone thinking I'm with IBM, you know?

131
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,260
-早安  梅琳  -约翰...
- Morning, Maylene. - John...

132
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,180
亲爱的  你知道我得等喝了咖啡
Now, sweetheart, you know I can't talk business

133
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,740
才能讨论工作的
till I get my "Ker-fee" in me.

134
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,160
内森  我不知道你要过来
Nathan, well, I didn't realize you were coming by.

135
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,340
需要喝点什么吗
Can I get you anything?

136
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,920
来杯咖啡吧  梅琳知道喜欢加什么
Cup of joe. Maylene knows how you like it.

137
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,650
不用了
I'm fine right here.

138
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,150
什么风把你刮来的
Wh-- what brings you by?

139
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,810
不久前你为了这个个人电脑项目跟我要钱
A little while back you asked me for money for this PC project.

140
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,000
如果我没记错的话  你没答应
Oh, you told me to shove it, if I remember correctly.

141
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,270
幸亏了  我周转了一下资金
Thank goodness you did. I was able to shift some things around--

142
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,740
我重新考虑了一下
I've reconsidered.

143
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,320
这样啊
I see.

144
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,670
我想  既然我的老朋友约翰·博斯沃思
I thought if my old pal John Bosworth

145
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,260
想从我这儿得到点什么
wants something from me,

146
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,810
我就应该给他
I should give it to him.

147
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,490
这个时间就喝酒太早了点吧  约翰
A little early in the day for a drink, ain't it, John?

148
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,340
你在取笑我吗  内森
You havin' fun, Nathan?

149
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,330
博斯  我们刚刚...
Hey, Boz, we just got a--

150
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,090
你以为你是谁  就这么大摇大摆走进来
Who the hell do you think you are, waltzing in here like this?

151
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,930
-什么  -你叫什么名字来着
- What? - What is your name again?

152
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,640
-卡梅伦  -滚出我的办公室  卡梅伦
- Cameron. - Get the hell out of my office, Cameron.

153
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,110
你以为我门口坐个秘书是干嘛的
Why do you think I have a damn secretary?

154
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,340
-不要让我再说第二遍  -好吧
- Don't make me say it again! - All right.

155
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,440
约翰  你今天有点暴躁啊  是不是
My God, John. You're a bit jumpy today, aren't you?

156
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,330
你不介意的话  我要开会去了
If you don't mind, I got a meeting.

157
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,000
{\an8}卡迪夫电子  巨人

158
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,320
我主要担心的是
My main concern is

159
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,500
要如何将这款产品与其他兼容机区分开
differentiating this from the other PC compatibles.

160
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,100
记者会把它与其他产品混为一谈
Press will want to lump it in with all the others.

161
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,150
卡梅伦写的操作系统
Well, Cameron's operating system

162
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,190
和市面上任何一款电脑都不同
is unlike anything else on the market.

163
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,360
卡梅伦
Cameron?

164
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,520
没错  它是交互式的
Uh, yeah, it's interactive.

165
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,470
我可以给你们展示一下
Um, I can just show it to you.

166
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,180
你们策略不对
You're barking up the wrong tree.

167
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,700
你们想要这台机器
No, you want this machine to stand out

168
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,090
能在展会上脱颖而出
from every other machine on the floor,

169
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,770
就不要再说这台机器如何
you gotta stop talking about the machine

170
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,570
而是应当讲讲造它的人
and you gotta start talking about the people that made it.

171
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,090
他们为此呕心沥血
They bled for this.

172
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,030
不管我们愿不愿意  未来都会降临
The future's coming whether we like it or not,

173
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,030
但没人说它会与我们有关
but it ain't written anywhere that it includes any of us.

174
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,490
而想要在其中有一席之地是要付出代价的
And getting there ain't free. There's a cost.

175
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,930
那些投资者想要独揽功劳
People who put up the money, they like to take the credit,

176
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,750
但功劳属于建造它的人
but the credit belongs to them that built it.

177
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,240
这台机器  就是未来
This machine is the future.

178
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,090
让他们明白这一点
Make them see that.

179
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,190
约翰·博斯沃思  你被捕了
John Bosworth, you're under arrest.

180
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,090
我们能去外面说吗
Can we do this outside?

181
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,480
-我们就在这儿说  -发生什么了
- We're gonna do this right here. - What the hell's going on?

182
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,630
-坐下  先生  -确保没人碰电脑
- Sit down, sir. - Make sure no one touches these computers.

183
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,170
所有人  请冷静  待在原地不要动
Everyone, please be calm and stay where you are.

184
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,110
我们要关闭这家公司
We're gonna be shutting this company down.

185
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,220
只要我们的公务完成
Once we have what we need,

186
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,060
你们就可以在搜身完后离开
you'll be searched and cleared to leave.

187
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,180
任何公司财产都不允许带离
No company property will be allowed to leave the premises.

188
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,650
现在  请耐心等待
For now, just sit tight.

189
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,790
我们会尽快让你们离开
We'll have you outta here as soon as possible.

190
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,570
请各位离开键盘
Step back from your keyboards, folks.

191
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,130
不要再打字了  谢谢
Stop typing, please.

192
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,240
待在原地  小心
Stay where you are. Heads up.

193
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,500
他们认为是约翰干的吗
They think John did it?

194
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,720
试试那扇门
Go try that door over there.

195
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,430
你有这个房间的钥匙吗
Do you have a key to this room?

196
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,330
有
Yes.

197
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,040
开门
Come on.

198
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,370
先生  请拿上个人物品离开这间屋子
Sir, take your personal belongings and get out.

199
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,920
-可是我  -快
- But I -- - Now.

200
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,860
把那个拿出去
Get that out of here.

201
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,920
他没在  我会告诉他你来过
He's not in. I'll tell him you stopped by.

202
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,450
没事  谢谢  不用了
Oh, no, thank you. That's fine.

203
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,190
我一会儿再来找他吧
I'll just -- I'll catch up with him later.

204
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,020
既然来了  顺便在他的告别卡上签个名吧
Oh, as long as you're here, I need you to sign his goodbye card.

205
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,810
告别卡
Goodbye card?

206
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,030
你不知道吗  你俩看起来走得挺近呢
You didn't hear? You two seemed so close.

207
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,670
-他是  被调职了吗  -他辞职的
- Was he -- was he transferred? - Resigned.

208
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,630
而且很突然
Would've been nice to have a little notice.

209
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,490
{\an8}祝你一切顺利  心想事成

210
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,170
他有没有说要去哪里  离开达拉斯吗
Did he say where he was going? Is he leaving Dallas?

211
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,620
他没说我也没问
He didn't say and I didn't ask.

212
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,320
你知道什么消息吗
Do you know anything?

213
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,290
我们去你家吧  弄清是怎么回事
Let's go back to your place, figure it out.

214
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,510
好  我家见
All right, I'll see you there.

215
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,820
他们在找电脑入侵  计算机犯罪的证据
They're looking for evidence of hacking, computer crime.

216
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,830
不可能是博斯沃思干的
Bosworth couldn't do that.

217
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,980
他认识的人中大概有三个能做到
He knows maybe three people who could.

218
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,570
你参与了吗
Are you a part of this?

219
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,700
博斯沃思找的我  行了吧
Bosworth came to me, okay?

220
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,220
他问我了不了解414黑客和入侵电脑
He asked if I knew about the 414s, about hacking.

221
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,470
真的很简单
It was so easy.

222
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,350
他们简直就...
They were practically -- like,

223
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,480
银行没有任何保护措施
the bank has no security whatsoever.

224
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,010
对不起
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,100
本来打算是等计算机分销商展览结束
We were gonna put all the money back in Cardiff's account

226
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,380
一销售出去  有了利润就把钱还给卡迪夫
as soon as we made some sales and we came back from COMDEX.

227
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,540
我们以为他不会发现的
I mean, we thought he'd never notice.

228
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,850
大家都出去
Everybody out.

229
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,890
只是个误会
It's all a misunderstanding.

230
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,340
不是误会
It's not a misunderstanding.

231
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,270
过不了一天我们就会把这事当笑料了
We'll be laughing about this in 24 hours.

232
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,800
戈登  你错了
Gordon, you're wrong.

233
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,640
怎么回事
What's going on?

234
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,010
-你知道这事吗  -我完全不知道
- Did you know about this? - I didn't know anything about this.

235
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,870
你知道  你参与了
Yes, you did. You were involved.

236
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,290
-我没有  -你有
- I was not involved. - Yes, you were.

237
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,660
-你肯定参与了  -是我干的
- You were involved from the -- - I did it.

238
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,510
我是想拯救公司
I was trying to save the company.

239
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,630
我们没有资金了
We were completely out of money.

240
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,100
你俩简直是绝配
You two are perfect for each other.

241
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,940
-你俩都是疯子  -如果我没这么做
- You're both psychotic. - If I hadn't done this,

242
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,160
我们几周前就关门大吉了
we would've been shut down weeks ago.

243
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,450
你所有的努力都将化为乌有
All your work would've been shelved.

244
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,590
别一副你做了义卖的模样  你抢了银行
Don't act like you threw a bake sale. You robbed a bank.

245
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,610
那只是卡迪夫的钱
It was Cardiff's money.

246
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,030
只要把电脑卖出去
Once we sold the computer,

247
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,750
我们就能把钱还上  还能挣钱...
we would've made it back and then some...

248
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,970
你应该先来问我  我们可以做个计划
You should've come to me. We could've made a plan.

249
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,110
现在倒好  所有人的工作都不保了
Now all of our careers are in jeopardy.

250
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,140
你还在想工作  我可能要进监狱了
Your careers? I could be going to jail.

251
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,280
你们俩真是  我太傻了  傻到家了
Oh, my God, you two. I'm so stupid. God, I'm stupid.

252
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,870
别扯上我  我和你一样生气
Stop including me in this. I'm just as upset as you are.

253
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,940
你到最后肯定会得利的
No, you're gonna come out on top of this somehow.

254
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,650
每次有坏事发生  你都能从中获益
Every time something terrible happens, you seem to benefit.

255
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,010
比如IBM发现我们逆向他们电脑的时候
IBM finding out we reverse engineered their PC,

256
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,280
卡梅伦弄丢她写的BIOS代码的时候
Cameron losing her work on the BIOS.

257
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,430
-什么  -没错
- What? - Oh, yeah.

258
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,730
他是为了宣传故意为之
He crashed it for publicity

259
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,150
然后看着你独自痛苦
and let you twist in the wind.

260
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,660
你们在床上说悄悄话时他没提起吗
Did he fail to mention that to you during pillow talk?

261
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,980
是真的吗
Is that true?

262
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,640
我看告发博斯的就是你
I'll bet you're the one that turned Boz in.

263
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,390
-这样你就是老大了  -乔  回答我
- Now you're top dog. - Joe, answer me.

264
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:12,010
没错  我是为了宣传  而且成功了
Yes, I did it. For publicity, which we got.

265
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,320
很抱歉为了我们的项目让你难过了
I'm sorry you had a bad day for the sake of our project.

266
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,310
-就难过而已吗  -你现在有什么资格
- "A bad day"? - Are you really in a place 

267
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,730
指责别人
to cast judgment right now?

268
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,660
而且你攻击我干嘛  戈登
And why the hell are you attacking me, Gordon?

269
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,980
-偷钱的是她  -我为它献出了全部生活
- She stole the money! - I put my life into that box.

270
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,540
我就没有吗
Like I didn't?

271
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,220
你不过起了个名字  加了个手柄
You gave it a name and a handle.

272
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,720
根本没什么是你造的
You didn't build a damn thing.

273
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,790
他说的对  你只会搞破坏
He's right. You only destroy things.

274
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,630
你从来没有创造过什么
You've never created anything.

275
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,530
你们俩的现在就是我创造的
I created both of you.

276
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,810
那么  一切都完了吗
So, it's over? Everything?

277
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,050
我们又
We're back to--

278
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,270
我们全白忙活了吗
we're back to where we started?

279
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,870
老天
Oh, my God, I--

280
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,500
真不敢相信又撞上这种事了
I can't believe this is happening again.

281
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,320
德州仪器那边还有职缺吗
Any openings at TI?

282
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,490
唐娜  我该怎么办
Donna, what do I do?

283
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,980
戈登  抱歉  我现在
Gordon, I'm sorry. I-- I just--

284
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,190
我现在没心思想这事
I can't deal with this right now.

285
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:08,720
唐娜
Donna...?

286
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,870
抱歉  我还有会
I'm sorry, I have a meeting.

287
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,810
唐娜
Donna?

288
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,930
我没准又得去我爸妈家睡沙发了
I might end up crashing on my parents' couch again.

289
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,210
我听说他拿钱去还赌债了
I heard he took the money to pay off gambling debts.

290
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,180
赌马欠的  他赌马上瘾
Horse racing. He's an addict.

291
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,270
这种人就该送进牢里修理修理
Jail should be a good place to work on that.

292
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,180
所以还是得雇老派靠得住的人
That's why you don't hire some ancient good old boy

293
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,040
来经营你的电脑生意
to run your computer business.

294
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,730
他肯定得被关一阵子了
I bet they send him away for a while.

295
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,350
至少接下来十年里
At least he knows where his meals are coming from

296
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,350
他不用愁饭吃
for the next 10 years.

297
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,350
你跟他谈过编码的事吗
You ever talk to him about code?

298
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,460
-就跟猿人似的不开化  -他就是一垃圾
- He's like a caveman. - He's a scumbag.

299
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,420
-你好  -乔·麦克米伦  卡迪夫电子
-  Hello? - Joe MacMillan, Cardiff Electric.

300
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,370
-你还好吗  吉姆  -你好啊  乔
- How you doing, Jim? - Oh, hey, Joe.

301
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,010
今年你去拉斯维加斯参展吗
We gonna see you out in Vegas this year?

302
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,790
我就是为这个找你
That's just what I'm calling you about.

303
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,200
我想给你个机会提前赚一笔
I wanted to give you an opportunity to get in early.

304
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,460
赶在参展后身价大涨之前  先订一小单
A small order now, before COMDEX, before the prices skyrocket.

305
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,480
我们还是打算进IBM的
I think we're gonna stick with IBM.

306
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,200
但是他们的电脑不便携啊
But IBM doesn't make a portable.

307
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,690
有  但是还没宣布
Well, not one they've announced yet.

308
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,340
这传言你从哪听来的
Where did you hear this rumor?

309
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,680
不知道  人人都这么说
I don't know. Everybody's talking about it.

310
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,750
-发布日期定下了吗  -明年上半年吧
- Is there a release date? - I hear early next year.

311
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,040
-太谢谢你了  吉姆  -没事  客气
- Thank you, Jim. - Sure. You bet.

312
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,220
总算把她们哄睡了
I finally got them down.

313
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,460
你也去睡会儿吧  亲爱的
Why don't you go to sleep, sweetheart?

314
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,010
你脸色很不好
You look terrible.

315
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,370
不了  我想等戈登回来
No, I want to wait until Gordon gets home.

316
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,290
-他打电话了吗  -还没
- Has he called yet? - No.

317
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,500
这种事是不是越来越多  自从...
This kinda thing been happening a lot since--

318
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,630
自从他在自家后院里挖坑吗
Since he dug a hole in our back yard?

319
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,180
妈  这种事从我们认识起就很寻常了
Mom, this kind of thing has been happening since the day we met.

320
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,400
我就是一问  亲爱的
I'm just asking, sweetheart.

321
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,460
至少工作还顺利吧
Work okay, at least?

322
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,350
亨特不在德州仪器干了
Hunt is leaving TI.

323
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,350
我的天  他怎么了
Oh, my goodness. What happened?

324
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,110
-被炒了吗  -不  他自己辞职了
- Did he get fired? - No, he resigned.

325
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,170
-也没提前说  -他在那里干得很好啊
- No notice. - Well, they love him over there.

326
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,390
怎么突然就想起来辞职了呢
Why on earth would he do a thing like that?

327
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,780
妈  我可能犯了个错误
Mom, I think I made a mistake.

328
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,730
我们在卢博克出差的时候
When we were in Lubbock...

329
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,860
这种事是难免的
Something like this was bound to happen.

330
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,960
妈  我没跟他上床
Mom, I didn't sleep with him.

331
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,640
那究竟是怎么了  亲爱的
Then what are we really talking about here, honey?

332
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,650
我不知道  我也不知道  我只是
I don't know. I don't know. I just--

333
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:01,250
我以为他对我没兴趣呢
I thought-- I thought he wasn't interested,

334
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,400
但他昨晚跑来我家外面
but then he was here last night, outside the house.

335
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,590
-然后呢  -也没发生什么
- And? - Well, nothing, really.

336
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,440
他慌了神  然后就走了
He got all flustered and left,

337
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,400
而且我觉着他在外面站了好一会儿了
and I think he'd been out there for a while.

338
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,340
戈登知道吗
Does Gordon know?

339
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,210
妈  我该怎么办
Mom, what am I gonna do?

340
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,340
你爸和我爱你
Your daddy and I love you,

341
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,260
我们也爱戈登  因为你爱他
and we love Gordon because you love him,

342
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,910
但看看你这惨样
but here you are, miserable,

343
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,210
整天拼死拼活地维持家庭
continuing to hold up this entire household

344
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,590
而他却不知道哪去了
while he's off God knows where.

345
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,110
我们会一直支持你
We will continue to support you

346
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,790
尽我们所能帮助你
and help you any way we can,

347
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,960
我们乐意照顾你到死
and we'll do so gladly until we die.

348
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,670
但是唐娜  你得认真地想一想
But, Donna, you need to think long and hard

349
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,420
为什么事情总是回到这里
about why we keep ending up back here.

350
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,300
你得好好为你自己
And you need to figure out what is best

351
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,580
和孩子们想一想了
for you and for your children.

352
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,530
你在干什么呢
What are you doing?

353
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,520
嘿  亲爱的
Hey, honey.

354
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,130
那是巨人吗
Is that the Giant?

355
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,170
是  我还买了牛奶  咱家的喝完了
Yeah, and I also got milk. I noticed that we were out.

356
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,560
戈登这是你偷来的吗  这不是证物吗
Gordon, did you steal that? Isn't that evidence?

357
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,820
不不不  如果是的话  早就被收走了
No, no, no. If it was evidence, they would've seized it.

358
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,460
戈登  这可不好
Gordon, this is not good.

359
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,060
我不知道你怎么想的  但是
I don't know what you're thinking, but--

360
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,980
唐娜  你别一看见我就想什么
Donna, I need you to stop looking at me and thinking,

361
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,640
"又来了  又是交响乐的事重现"
"Here we go again. It's the Symphonic all over again."

362
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,640
-这回不一样  明白吗  -戈登
- 'Cause it's not, okay? - Gordon--

363
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,940
唐娜  真的不一样  我发誓
Look, Donna, it's not. I promise.

364
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:36,520
跟你说  这东西  就是一破烂
Look, this-- this right here, this is shit.

365
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,790
你当时制止我是对的
Okay, you were right to pull the plug.

366
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,450
你让你爸别再给我们钱是对的
You were right to tell your dad to stop giving us money.

367
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,660
你知道了  你知道多久...
You knew? How long did you know--

368
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,630
听着  我生了很久的气
Hey, hey, hey. Look, I was angry for a long time, 

369
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,060
但我已经不气了
but I'm not anymore.

370
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,920
你做得对  好吗
You were right. Okay?

371
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,040
你担心我吗  是这样吗
Are you worried about me? Is that what this is?

372
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,000
这次不用你担心
Let me do the worrying this time, okay?

373
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,530
我没问题的  我有个计划
I got this. I have a plan, all right?

374
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,240
我会找到卡梅伦和乔
I'm gonna find Cameron and Joe

375
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,710
我们一起做  好吗
and we're gonna do this together, okay?

376
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,110
我需要他们  我自己做不来
I need them. I can't do this on my own.

377
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,250
什么事你自己做不来
You can't do what on your own?

378
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,560
去计算机分销商展览  我要去那儿
Go to COMDEX. I'm gonna go to COMDEX

379
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,820
卖掉"巨人"  就像我们计划的那样
and sell the Giant, just like we'd always planned.

380
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,160
去他的内森·卡迪夫
Damn Nathan Cardiff.

381
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,370
太疯狂了  你是在痴人说梦
That's crazy. That's insane.

382
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,850
我爱你  但卡梅伦现在都是通缉犯了
I love you, but Cameron is some sort of wanted criminal now.

383
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,790
-谁知道...  -我知道这很疯狂
- And who knows where-- - I know it's crazy.

384
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,770
但你也很疯狂啊
I know, but you're crazy, too.

385
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,040
你忘记了  但你是疯狂的
No, no, you forget that, but you are.

386
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,790
我们俩本来都很疯狂  但突然间
We were both crazy and then all of a sudden,

387
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,620
你就决定变理智了
you decided you needed to be the sane one.

388
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,700
-没错  因为...  -你需要照顾我  但你不用
- Yes, because-- - That you needed to take care of me, but you don't.

389
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,180
跟我一起疯狂吧
Look, be crazy with me.

390
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,320
我需要你做我的后盾  唐娜
I need you to be behind me, Donna.

391
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,650
这次我需要你支持我
I need you to support me on this.

392
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,030
我是你的后盾  戈登  你知道我总会支持你的
I am behind you, Gordon. You know that I'm here for you.

393
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,450
谢谢
Thank you.

394
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,570
程序员说卡梅伦可能去奥斯汀了
Listen, the coders think that Cameron went down to Austin.

395
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,780
如果我即刻动身  我明早就能到那儿
If I leave now, I can make it there by morning.

396
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,060
然后接上乔  再回来打包去计算机分销商展览
Then Joe, then back here to pack, then COMDEX.

397
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,790
我要卖电脑了
I'm gonna sell a computer.

398
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,960
我自己的电脑  就像我一直说的那样
My own computer, just like I always said I was.

399
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,820
我保证
I can promise you that.

400
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,770
我爱你
I love you.

401
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,660
-喂  -妈妈  是我
- Hello? - Mom, it's me.

402
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,340
甜心  出什么事了
Sweetheart, what's wrong?

403
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,920
你还好吗
Is everything okay?

404
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,020
我和孩子们要去跟你住段时间
The girls and I need to come and stay with you for a while.

405
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,730
好的  你跟戈登说过了吗
Okay. Have you talked to Gordon about this?

406
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,760
你能明天一大早来接她们吗
Can you just come pick them up first thing in the morning?

407
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,530
等戈登回家后  我想跟他谈谈
I'm gonna talk to Gordon when he gets home

408
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,950
到时我不希望孩子们在场
and I don't want them to be here when I do.

409
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,940
下一局是我的了
I got next game.

410
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:06,410
天呐  真后悔没亲眼看到你闯进卡迪夫电子
God, I would've paid money to see you break into Cardiff Electric.

411
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,840
乔知道"巨人"在你车库里吗
Does Joe know it's in your garage?

412
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,900
不  我先来找的你
No, I came to you first.

413
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,710
我知道我们工作上有很多摩擦
Look, I know that we've had less than an ideal working relationship,

414
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,730
有些时候是我不好
and I'll take some of the flak on that.

415
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,980
没错  生活上你对我也很混
Yeah, and you've been kind of a dick to me outside of work, too.

416
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,500
先看看我们有什么共识
Well, let's focus on what we do have in common.

417
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,150
如果我们还是把"巨人"拿去展览会呢
What if we take the Giant to COMDEX anyway?

418
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,290
吸引到很多买家
You know? And orders start coming in?

419
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,690
卡迪夫绝不会挡这种财路
I mean, Cardiff won't turn down that kind of money.

420
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,440
他会被迫恢复个人电脑部
He'll be forced to reopen the department.

421
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,850
你为什么非要我加入呢
Why do you even care if I come?

422
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,280
因为半台机器是你设计的
Because you are responsible for half the machine.

423
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,300
我们有才能  乔没有
We're the talent, not Joe.

424
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,900
不行  我惹上的麻烦已经够多了
No, I'm in enough trouble as it is.

425
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,630
那好吧  至少值得一试
Okay, okay. Well, it was worth a shot.

426
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,540
我想让你知道
And I want you to know that

427
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,110
虽然我们有分歧
even though that we've had our differences

428
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,480
我又不完全清楚
and I'm not entirely clear

429
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,080
你特殊操作系统的功能
on what the function of your special OS is,

430
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,560
但我会尽量在演示时弄好的
I'll try and do it justice at the demo.

431
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,930
我知道你想干嘛  我不吃这套
I know what you're doing. It's not gonna work.

432
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,560
好吧  那你听我说说
Okay, well, let me make sure I got it.

433
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,170
比微软磁盘操作系统更强大
It's better than MS-DOS because it does things

434
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,770
因为它会问候你
like ask you how your day is going

435
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,690
如果你指令错误  还会给你更正
and corrects you if you make a command wrong.

436
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,660
等等  我知道该怎么说了
Oh, wait, no, I know what I'll say.

437
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,220
就像电脑里住了你妈一样
It's like having your mother inside your computer.

438
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,800
怎么样
How's that?

439
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,400
开门啊  乔  我们知道你在里面
Come on, Joe. We know you're in there.

440
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,750
开门
Open up.

441
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,550
他可能在避风头
He's probably hiding.

442
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,370
我们现在怎么办
Well, what should we do now?

443
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,080
把这看做是我们不该插手的预兆吧
Take this as a sign we shouldn't be involved.

444
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,660
等等  别这样
Wait, wait, come on.

445
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,920
你身上有30块吗  我可没有
Do you have 30 grand on you? 'Cause I sure as hell don't,

446
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,280
而现在付我们展台  酒店房间
and right about now the checks for our booth,

447
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,630
和旅费的支票都没法兑现
our suite, and our trip have just bounced.

448
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:40,370
而且我们实话实说吧  他很会说话
And if we're really being honest with each other, he's not a bad talker.

449
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,870
你有他家钥匙
You have a key.

450
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,970
该死  他把家清空了  他跑了
Shit, he cleared out. He's gone.

451
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,040
他没跑  他家本来就这样
He's not gone, this is just how he lives.

452
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,610
故意的吗
On purpose?

453
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:00,360
天呐  我对这人真是毫不了解
God, I know nothing about this guy.

454
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,480
除了他喜欢玻璃
Other than he likes glass.

455
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,360
我要打给唐娜  我不想她担心
I'm gonna call Donna. I don't want her to worry.

456
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,440
{\an8}你叫什么

457
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,170
{\an8}唐娜

458
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,770
{\an8}你好  唐娜  你想做什么

459
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,910
{\an8}找到回去的路

460
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,460
{\an8}抱歉  唐娜  我没找到"回去的路"这个程序

461
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,500
{\an8}需要我做别的吗

462
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:21,340
{\an8}不了  谢谢

463
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,530
{\an8}你可真礼貌

464
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,320
我不记得了  都多久...
I don't remember. It's been--

465
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,290
得了吧  我想听听
Oh, come on. I wanna hear about it.

466
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,940
真的  我不记得了
Honestly, I don't even remember.

467
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,620
我告诉你我的第一次
I'll tell you my first time.

468
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,390
-好吧  -好
- Okay. - Okay...

469
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,360
是苹果二号
it was, um, the Apple II.

470
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,300
天呐  我觉得自己好老
Oh, God, jeez. I feel so old.

471
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,810
-不用了  -好
- I'm good. - All right.

472
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:30,390
我妈的新男友给我买的圣诞礼物
Uh, my mom's new boyfriend got it for me for Christmas.

473
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,460
就是想讨好我
Some pathetic attempt at winning me over.

474
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:37,250
到了新年的时候  我已经
But by New Year's I had disassembled it

475
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,450
把它拆装四次了
and reassembled it four times.

476
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,650
你拆开你妈的新男友用了多久
How long did it take you to disassemble your mom's new boyfriend?

477
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,490
他一直待到复活节呢
He hung in there till Easter.

478
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,900
你以前从未说起过你家人
You never really mention your family.

479
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,890
没什么可说的
There's not much to say.

480
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,820
好吧
Okay.

481
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:02,230
那是圣诞节前几周
Well, it was a few weeks before Christmas

482
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:05,260
我在《大众电子》的封面上看到了阿尔泰
and I saw the Altair on the cover of "Popular Electronics"

483
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,160
就一心想买到
and I just had to get the kit.

484
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,880
但我当时还在上学  已经欠了很多学生贷款
But I was in school and up to my ears in student loans,

485
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,020
又刚把钱都花在
and I'd just spent my last nickel

486
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,350
给唐娜买订婚戒指上了
on getting an engagement ring for Donna,

487
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,900
那可是笔寅吃卯粮的大钱
which cost serious money I didn't have.

488
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,030
我猜猜  大钻戒吗
Oh, let me guess. A big diamond.

489
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:24,160
我和唐娜以前会给彼此写情书
Me and Donna used to write each other these little love notes,

490
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,760
但都是加密的
but they were encrypted. We--

491
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,740
我们建立了自己的多字码密码
we developed our own polyalphabetic cipher...

492
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,730
真呆
Geeks.

493
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,710
总之  我自己设计了戒指
Anyways, I designed the ring myself

494
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,250
还把密码嵌在了上面
and incorporated the cipher into it,

495
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,100
要解开我们的密码
and the only way to break our code

496
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,380
就需要唐娜的订婚戒指
was with Donna's engagement ring.

497
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:47,430
等等  你用解码戒指跟你妻子求婚的
Wait, you proposed to your wife with a decoder ring?

498
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,500
-是啊  -戈登  天呐
- I know. - Gordon, wow.

499
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,750
我当时才23嘛
I was 23, you know?

500
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,550
她喜欢谜题什么的  这样挺好的
Anyways, she likes puzzles, and it was nice, you know?

501
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:58,300
有铂金有蓝宝石的
It was platinum with sapphires and stuff.

502
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,930
我本打算过节的时候给她
Anyways, I was gonna give it to her over the holidays.

503
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,620
但圣诞节那天
Well, Christmas Day comes

504
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,370
我去拿戒指  却找不到了
and I go to get the ring and it's gone.

505
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,600
你真该看到我当时的样子
You shoulda seen me.

506
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,280
我把整个公寓都翻了个底朝天  就为找戒指
I mean, I tore that apartment upside down looking for it.

507
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,520
唐娜拿着我的礼物进来了
And Donna comes in with my present

508
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,550
她冲我大吼
and she's yelling at me

509
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,800
让我别折腾公寓了  打开礼物
to stop ransacking the apartment and open it.

510
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,090
就是阿尔泰电脑
And there it was, the Altair computer kit.

511
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,500
我知道这钱不会是她跟她父母借的
And I knew she hadn't borrowed the money from her parents

512
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,470
因为她当时还没跟父母介绍过我
because she hadn't even told them about me yet.

513
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,530
你能相信吗
Would you believe

514
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,910
她找到了订婚戒指
that she found the engagement ring

515
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,720
然后当掉了戒指  给我买阿尔泰电脑
and pawned it to get me the Altair?

516
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,660
她还跟我说
And she said to me,

517
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,520
"等我们卖出第一台电脑你再给我买戒指吧"
"You can buy me a ring once we've sold our first PC."

518
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,420
哇
Yeah.

519
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,420
真难想象你和唐娜也曾是我这个年纪
It's hard to imagine you and Donna ever being my age.

520
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,850
我给她买来了
I got it for her.

521
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,440
什么  解码戒指吗
What, the decoder ring?

522
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,070
嗯  上周
Yeah, last week.

523
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:59,020
我知道我们一定能在计算机分销商展览上大获成功
I knew we were gonna nail it at COMDEX 

524
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,590
卖掉巨人
and sell the Giant.

525
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,200
所以我找当年伯克利的那个珠宝师
So I had the same jeweler in Berkeley

526
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,640
又做了一个  寄到办公室
make one up and send it out to the office.

527
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,870
就藏在我车库里呢
It's hidden in my garage right now.

528
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,050
等下周回来  我要送给她
I'm gonna give it to her when I get back next week.

529
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,380
希望我们能卖掉巨人
I hope we sell the Giant.

530
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,720
能的
We will.

531
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,980
老天爷
Jesus.

532
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,090
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

533
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,200
我不久留  就来问你个问题
I'm not gonna stay. I just came to ask you a question.

534
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,680
你大老远跑来纽约就为问我个问题
You came all the way to New York to ask me a question?

535
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,730
我直视你的时候更容易分辨你的谎言
It's easier to tell when you're lying when I'm looking right at you.

536
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,590
-说吧  -IBM在开发便携电脑吗
- Let's have it. - Is IBM developing a portable PC?

537
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,330
是的
We are.

538
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,730
就为了打击我的电脑吗
So you could crush my machine?

539
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,330
就为了打击我吗
Crush me?

540
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:01,860
我跟那事毫无关系  项目团队在博卡
I had nothing to do with it. The team's down in Boca.

541
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,710
你就不能跟我实言相告  哪怕一次吗
For once, can you tell me the truth?

542
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,330
你或许会觉得震惊  乔
It may come as a shock to you, Joe,

543
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,680
但你并非宇宙的中心
but you're not the center of the universe.

544
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,350
就算我早知道你在建造便携电脑
Even if I knew you were making a portable,

545
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,500
你觉得我凭一己之力
you think I could alter the course

546
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,630
就能左右IBM这艘大航母的航向吗
of the aircraft carrier that is IBM,

547
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,680
逼他们建台便携电脑好打击你
make them build one just so I could hurt you?

548
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,270
你简直是疯了
You're out of your mind.

549
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,490
如果能让你好受点  我们离销售至少还有一年呢
If it makes you feel better, we're at lst a year away from market.

550
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,940
如果你是想问电脑的事  电话上说就行了
Now, if you wanted to ask me about computers, you could've called me,

551
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,460
所以你还是坐下  把你真实的目的告诉我吧
so why don't you have a seat and let me know why you're really here?

552
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,930
-我要的已经得到了  -坐下
- I got what I came for. - Sit down!

553
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,650
我们重新开始
Now... let's start again.

554
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,620
你四月之后一直在达拉斯
You've been in Dallas since April.

555
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,500
在那之前呢
Where were you before that?

556
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,200
你屈尊告诉我事实之后
After you deigned to tell me the truth,

557
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,800
我驱车走遍了全国
I drove across the country to figure out...

558
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,450
想要弄清楚我究竟更像你还是她
am I her son or your son?

559
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,660
即便她已经死了
Even if she was dead, 

560
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:19,530
在那之前和你赶走她之后她必然有过一段人生
she must've lived an entire life after you sent her away.

561
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:23,410
她去过的地方  认识的人
Places she'd been, people who knew her.

562
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,520
我尽力找到每一个人
I talked to everyone I could,

563
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,630
想找到我身上属于她的那部分
trying to find the part of her that was me.

564
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,690
乔啊
Oh, Joe.

565
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,470
是因为我太像她吗
Do I remind you of her?

566
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,700
所以你才恨我吗
Is that why you hate me?

567
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,520
我爱你
I love you.

568
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,390
我也爱你母亲
And I loved your mother.

569
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,180
你让我以为她抛弃了我
You let me think she abandoned me

570
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,070
还告诉我她死了
and then told me she was dead

571
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,210
可之后她还活了23年
23 years before she was.

572
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,340
我不要再跟你说这些了
I'm not going over this again.

573
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,580
我让她走是因为她差点害死你
I sent her away because she almost killed you.

574
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,760
是的  我为了保护你撒了谎
And, yes, yes, I lied to protect you.

575
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,720
她让你摔下屋顶啊
She let you fall, for heaven's sake!

576
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,470
至少她带我上去了
At least she took me up there.

577
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,320
因为她嗑药了
Because she was high.

578
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,820
她希望我成为梦想家
She wanted me to be a dreamer.

579
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,580
你妈妈才不是什么梦想家呢
Your mother wasn't a dreamer.

580
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,670
她只是迷惘
She was lost.

581
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,320
真正的梦想家  有才华的人
A real dreamer, someone that matters,

582
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,290
能凭空造出新东西
makes something out of nothing.

583
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,800
那全得靠努力
And that only happens with hard work.

584
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,890
这你是懂的
You understand that.

585
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,730
你一直懂这道理
You always have.

586
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,500
这方面你更像我
You're more like me in that regard,

587
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,840
谢天谢地
and thank God.

588
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,120
如果你搬回来  我能给你找个地方
Now, if you move back, I'll find a place for you.

589
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,280
你很快就能回归正轨
You'll be back on track soon enough.

590
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,690
在IBM干吗
At IBM?

591
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,790
人是健忘的
People have short memories.

592
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,300
我就不
Not me.

593
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,280
乔  我们都清楚
Joe, you and I both know

594
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:11,150
你总得回归现实
you have to come back down to earth eventually.

595
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,310
你已经来了
You're here now.

596
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,920
最难的部分已经过去了
The hard part's over.

597
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,370
我要做便携电脑项目的主要负责人
I need to be the primary on the portable.

598
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,020
管理整个项目
Run the whole thing.

599
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:34,760
如果这就是你要的  我会想办法
That's what you want, I'll figure it out.

600
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,990
很高兴你回来了  儿子
I'm glad you're back, son.

601
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,650
你怎么在这儿
What are you doing here?

602
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:02,120
我们昨晚来找你了
We came to look for you last night.

603
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,970
你在我床上睡了吗
Did you sleep in my bed?

604
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,280
是啊  你真该买个沙发
Yeah, you know, you should really get a couch.

605
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,130
我和唐娜...
You know, me and Donna have... 

606
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,920
够了  我只是来拿东西的
Stop, I just came here to get my things.

607
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,810
你要走了
You're leaving?

608
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,910
我要回IBM去
I'm going back to IBM

609
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,300
造一台有一日能面市的便携电脑
to build a portable PC that will actually see the light of day.

610
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,260
你开我心吗
Are you kidding me?

611
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,050
我一开始就该这么做
It's what I should've done from the start.

612
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:25,030
你回IBM去  就是背叛自己的一切信仰
You go back to IBM, you go back on everything you stand for.

613
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,720
那就是你辜负我们了
That'll be you failing us.

614
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,460
我刚刚说了  是我错了
I just told you I was wrong. 

615
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,160
我终于懂了  我终于懂你了
I finally get it. I finally get how you operate.

616
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,580
-好啊  滚吧  -不不
- Great, get out of my apartment. - No, no.

617
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,720
自始至终
Throughout this whole thing,

618
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,660
你总得控制一切  决定一切
you needed to be in control, make every decision.

619
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,820
你让公司每个人都按你的意思做
You have everybody at the company bow to your will.

620
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,980
但当你终于得到一个机会
But when you're finally faced with a real opportunity

621
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,870
做个梦想家  带大家打一场值得打的战役时
to be a visionary and lead in a battle that's worth fighting for,

622
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,530
你却决定离开
you're just gonna move on.

623
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,830
你这人真的很会说  乔
You know, you can spin a good word, Joe,

624
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,180
虽然你并不是工程师
even though you're not an engineer

625
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,750
更不是梦想家
and you are certainly no visionary,

626
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,550
但我没想到你居然会是个懦夫
but I never thought you were a coward.

627
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,070
你就不知道什么时候该闭嘴
And you never know when to shut your mouth!

628
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,880
说中了
Gotcha.

629
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,230
带着这股火气去展览会  我们一定能成功
Bring that fire to COMDEX and we'll kill.

630
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,680
-展览会  -想想啊
- COMDEX? - Think about it.

631
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:07,240
有几家公司的执行总裁上周被人铐走了
How many companies had their CEO hauled off in handcuffs last week?

632
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,990
展览会上有超过一千家参展者
There's over a thousand exhibitors there.

633
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,050
几乎不可能脱颖而出
It's nearly impossible to stand out in all that noise,

634
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,490
但人们一定会排队来看
but people will be lining up

635
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,190
乱得一塌糊涂的卡迪夫电子
to see the train wreck that is Cardiff Electric,

636
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,070
到时候  我们就让他们大开眼界
and when they do, we blow them away.

637
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,470
但巨人不在我们手上啊
But we don't have the Giant.

638
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:28,700
我偷来了  我给拿回来了
I stole it, took it. I got it back.

639
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,060
你
You--

640
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,860
你偷回来了
you stole it?

641
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,170
你真是疯了
You're crazy.

642
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,590
是啊
You're damn right.

643
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,170
八个月前  我是个苦逼的销售工程师
Eight months ago, I was a miserable sales engineer

644
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,390
一天最喜欢做的事就是下班回家
whose favorite part of the day was clocking out.

645
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,680
昨天  我闯进犯罪现场
Yesterday, I broke into a crime scene

646
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,790
偷回我出力建造的最先进的电脑
to steal the state-of-the-art computer that I helped create.

647
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,790
卡梅伦  天才程序员
Cameron, the brilliant programmer,

648
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,950
本来再过几个月就能大学毕业
months away from a college degree

649
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:54,450
在软件界大展拳脚  却退学
and a promising career in software, she dropped out,

650
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:57,570
最后入侵了国家银行的电脑
ended up hacking into the computers of a national bank.

651
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:00,770
约翰·博斯沃思  德州老好人
John Bosworth, Texas good ol' boy,

652
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:03,540
"我恨乔·米卡梅伦俱乐部"的主席
president of the "I Hate Joe MacMillan" fan club.

653
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,980
约翰·博斯沃思为了
John Bosworth hatched a plan

654
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,300
让项目得以继续
to embezzle thousands and thousands of dollars

655
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,650
策划挪用了大笔公款
just to keep this project alive.

656
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,310
你把我们都整疯了
You-- you made us all crazy,

657
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:14,140
别一副你突然清醒过来的样子
so don't act like you suddenly found sanity.

658
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,170
巨人在我们手里  万事俱备
We have the Giant. It is ready to go.

659
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:20,210
只欠...钱
The only thing we need is money.

660
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,720
什么
I'm sorry?

661
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,810
我们需要...
We-- we-- we need-- you know...

662
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,440
我们需要你拿钱  乔
we need your money, Joe.

663
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:33,490
这就是我的全部家当
This is all I have.

664
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:34,770
什么
What?

665
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:39,010
衣服  车  就是我的全部
These clothes, that car, that's all I have.

666
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,520
抱歉  戈登
I'm sorry, Gordon.

667
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,570
看来到底有人被我唬住了
I guess someone was buying my act after all.

668
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,400
车值多少钱
How much is the car worth?

669
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,320
-那车多漂亮啊  -别念叨了
- Such a beautiful car. - Let it go.

670
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:07,320
跟你说  唐娜  我现在势不可挡
Look, I'm telling you, Donna, I'm on a roll.

671
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,040
他们都同意了
They're both on board.

672
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,770
我还让乔卖了他的保时捷
I got Joe to sell his Porsche

673
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:14,270
这下我们有钱去展览会了
so now we've got enough money for COMDEX.

674
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,590
怎么回事
What's this?

675
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,150
我要跟你一起去
I'm going with you.

676
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,220
真的
You are?

677
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,480
唐娜  女儿们呢
Oh, Donna. What about the girls?

678
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,750
在我父母那儿  看来我是疯了
They're at my parents'. I guess I am crazy.

679
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,650
好消息  唐娜也要来
Good news-- Donna's coming.

680
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,500
太好了  多多益善
Wonderful. The more the merrier.

681
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:54,000
我们走之前还得去一个地方
We've gotta make one last stop before we go.

682
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,710
进来
Get inside.

683
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,270
来这儿可真蠢
Pretty stupid idea you coming.

684
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,130
巴瑞给你做律师吗
Barry's your lawyer?

685
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,020
不是
No.

686
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,280
不是的
No.

687
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,420
巴瑞替我处理事务  但他是作为我朋友
Barry does paperwork, but he's my friend.

688
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,760
我还没提出  就给我保释了
Put up my bail before I even thought to ask.

689
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,220
他们绝不会相信是你一个人干的
They're never gonna believe you did this alone.

690
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,390
你没有那方面的技术知识
You don't have the technical knowledge.

691
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,870
你知道吗  那家银行
Did you know that damn bank

692
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,130
他们的拨入账户管理分时系统
was using a DEC-20 running TOPS

693
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:44,590
用的是DEC20主机  运行TOPS系统
for their dial-in account management timesharing system?

694
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:47,120
真的  你知道吗  如果你动作够快
I kid you not. Turns out, if you do it quick enough,

695
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,040
在异常处理程序被调用之前
before the exception handlers are invoked,

696
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,410
用control+C跳出用户程序
you can control-C out of the user program

697
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,390
你就会得到一个
and then you're left sitting with a terminal session 

698
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:55,770
对账户有特殊权限的终端
on an account which has some pretty interesting privileges,

699
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,490
可以运行kermit协议
including running Kermit.

700
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,380
我有个好老师啊
Oh, I had a good teacher.

701
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,870
你来干嘛
Now, why'd you come?

702
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,140
我们要去计算机分销商展览了
We're going to COMDEX. 

703
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,000
真的啊  你们怎么做到的
No kidding. How did you manage that?

704
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:16,190
使了点小坏吧
It's kind of a rogue operation.

705
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,150
本来就该如此
Well, that's just as it should be.

706
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,130
我没事的
I'll be all right.

707
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,180
快去吧
Oh, come on, now.

708
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,870
去展览会
Go to COMDEX.

709
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,160
把他们都打趴下
Knock 'em dead.

710
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,580
就算是为了我
Do that for me.

711
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,120
快走吧
Get the hell outta here.

712
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:08,850
好了  大家都准备好了吗
All right, everybody ready?

713
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,980
-嗯  -好了
- Yep. - We're good.

714
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:15,010
我们要去拉斯维加斯参加展览会喽
We're off to Vegas, COMDEX!

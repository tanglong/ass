	还有多远
	How much longer?
	大概三百英里吧
	几点能到维加斯
	What time do we get to Vegas?
	上午9点吗
	杂物箱里有餐巾纸
	There's napkins in the glove box.
	{\an8}巨人
	结语不错  有神秘感
	Nice ending. Mysterious.
	吊他们的胃口
	Leave 'em wanting more.
	我们紧张个什么劲啊
	Why are we freaking out about this, anyway?
	这是场展销会
	I mean, it's a trade show.
	他们想要巨人  压力大的该是他们
	They want the Giant. The pressure's on them.
	你以为那些分销商
	Okay, you think thousands of vendors
	会神奇地聚在我们展位前吗
	are just gonna magically swarm our booth?
	-当然了  会排起长队的  -重点不在展位
	- Hell, yes. Get in line. - The booth isn't the point.
	那只是用来辨别真正的买家
	That's just a way to identify the real buyers
	然后拉去我们的套房
	and then get them up to our suite.
	参加首展晚会派对
	For the opening night party.
	没错  套房里的才是重头戏
	Yeah, suite's where the action is.
	交易都是在那里敲定的
	It's where we nail down all the real deals.
	大家都很忐忑
	Everybody's terrified.
	没人知道哪种技术能赢得青睐
	Nobody knows which technology's gonna win.
	你的朋友想坑你
	Oh, your friends are trying to rip you off.
	敌人对你示好
	Your enemies are buying you drinks.
	竞争很激烈  乱极了
	It's a catfight. It's total chaos.
	简直是资本主义的最高境界
	It's capitalism at its finest.
	在苏格兰群岛
	In the Scottish Isles,
	人们在一年中最冷的那天庆祝节日
	they hold a festival on the coldest day of the year.
	镇上的人穿上维京人的服装
	The town's people dress up in Viking costumes
	分组比赛
	and compete in squads,
	载歌载舞  纵情畅饮
	drinking and singing and dancing.
	最后到午夜
	Finally at midnight,
	他们会来到位于镇广场的巨型木船前
	they march up to a huge wooden ship in the town square.
	然后呢
	Then what?
	胜者们会把船烧毁
	Then the winners burn it to the ground.
	你跟我们说这个干嘛
	Why the hell did you just tell us that?
	{\an8}欢迎来到83年计算机分销商展览
	早上好  登记入住吗
	Good mning. Checking in?
	卡迪夫电子
	Cardiff Electric.
	我们在9楼订了一间三卧套房
	We have a three-bedroom suite on the ninth floor.
	好的  请您先填写一下登记卡
	Excellent. If you'd just fill out your registration card.
	抱歉  您刚才说卡迪夫吗
	I'm sorry, did you say Cardiff?
	-是啊  -失陪一下
	- That's right. - Excuse me for one moment.
	-我是经理  -我是约翰·博斯沃思
	- I'm the manager. - Uh, John Bosworth.
	-有问题吗  -恐怕是有
	- Is there a problem? - I'm afraid so.
	我们今早刷了您的信用卡  但是被拒付了
	We ran your card this morning and it was declined.
	我们打了电话  但是没人接听
	We tried to call, but no answer.
	很不幸  我们只能取消了您预约的房间
	Unfortunately, we had no choice but to release your room.
	太荒谬了
	That's absurd.
	-我要给信用卡公司打电话  -我们已经打了
	- Let me call the credit card company. - We already did.
	您的公司账户被冻结了
	Your corporate account has been frozen...
	因为要接受刑事调查
	due to a pending criminal investigation.
	那就刷我的卡吧
	Here, take a personal card.
	刷这张绝对没问题
	You won't have any problem with this.
	"乔瑟夫·麦克米伦"
	"Joseph MacMillan."
	您不是约翰·博斯沃思吗
	I thought you were John Bosworth.
	能付钱不就行吗
	If I can pay, what does it matter?
	抱歉  房间都订满了
	I'm sorry, we're fully booked.
	我可以每晚再加200块
	I'm willing to add a $200 premium per night.
	等着要那间房的就有30个人
	I have a waiting list 30 names long for that room.
	没犯法的正经人
	Legitimate names.
	现在怎么办
	So, what now?
	展位没了
	We lost our booth.
	楼层经理说他也许能给我们挤出个位置
	The floor manager said he might be able to squeeze us in.
	我20分钟后就得答复
	I'm supposed to get back to him in 20 minutes.
	正好给了我们找其他酒店的时间
	Well, that gives us time to find another hotel.
	展会就在隔壁
	The expo's right next door.
	离开主街我们就失去了据点和人气
	We move off the Strip, we lose our base, all our walk-in traffic.
	欢迎宴会就在今晚  所有人都住在这儿
	Our welcoming party's tonight. Everyone stays here.
	但都订满了  我们能怎么办  贿赂吗
	But it's booked. What are we supposed to do, bribe somebody?
	-我试过了  -我们可是在拉斯维加斯
	- I tried that. - Christ, we're in Las Vegas.
	有一万一千美金现款
	We have $11,000 in cash.
	我们就不能想想办法吗
	Can we get off our asses and make a move?
	质子打印机  1475套房
	Hey, Protonix Printers, suite 1475.
	那对桑尼维尔市的兄弟  记得吗
	Those brothers from Sunnyvale, remember?
	不记得
	No.
	They were, like, six booths away from us in '81.
	我记得他们的演示  糟透了
	I remember their demo. It sucked.
	打给楼层经理  安排会面
	Call the floor manager. Set the meet.
	不管位置在哪  价格多贵
	I don't care where it is or how much it costs,
	拿到展位就行
	just get us a booth.
	你找来你最好的蓝色西装去洗手间换上
	You, find your best blue suit and change in the bathroom.
	-我们要干嘛  -在这里搞到个房间
	- What are we doing? - We're gonna make room in the inn.
	来吧  赶紧的
	Come on, hustle up.
	在文本模式下  打印机是逻辑查找的
	In text mode, the printer is logic-seeking.
	你一定会问  这是什么意思
	What do I mean by that, you ask?
	{\an8}盛会大师  质子打印机
	这意味着它的打印头可以双向移动
	I mean it can print with its head moving in both directions.
	是的  你没听错
	Yes, you heard that right.
	你的MX-80点阵打印机
	Now, your average dot matrix printer, your DMP,
	{\pos(182,252)}爱普生1980年推出的经典打印机
	限制了你打印成品的大小必须符合标准
	your MX-80, restricts you to a standard output size.
	这适用于打印商业信函
	Which is fine for business letters
	和普通会计材料等等
	and general accounting and such...
	但那些更私人化的情况呢
	But what about those moments that demand a more personal touch?
	这就是盛会大师大展身手之机了
	That's where the OccasionMaster steps in.
	预先设定的字体  气球和动感的图形
	With our pre-set fonts and balloons and sparkles graphics,
	一定会给你最亲爱的人另一番感受
	your near and dearest are guaranteed a special feeling.
	来看结果吧  分发些样品  小皮
	Result-- let's pass out those samples, Petey.
	从露天招待会到单身派对
	From the garden party to the bachelor party,
	盛会大师是真正的...
	the OccasionMaster is truly...
	庆典大师
	Your master of ceremonies.
	{\pos(252,276)}本意为司仪
	有什么问题吗
	Any questions?
	串行还是并行接口
	Serial port or parallel?
	现在只有并行接口
	Well, it's just parallel for now,
	但我们希望能在未来改进这一点
	but that's something that we hope to upgrade in the future.
	你们要价多少
	And you're asking how much for it?
	九百美元不含税
	Oh, uh, $900 plus tax.
	每秒打印字符数是多少
	What's the CPS rate?
	It's 80 to 100, depending.
	所以说我花了一千块
	So, I'm supposed to pay a thousand dollars
	还要等上20分钟才能打印一封我只要花5分钟
	to wait 20 minutes for that thing to spit out a thank-you note
	就能写好的感谢信
	when I can write my own in five?
	每秒打印100个字符已经相当快了
	但也没快得像闪电啊
	Yeah, well, let's not act like it's lightning.
	尤其是打印图片的时候
	Especially with the graphics.
	你不能调整下打印头让它更快些吗
	Can't you modify the head to go any faster?
	我们一直在测试盛会大师
	We've been testing the OM
	至今没有发现什么问题
	with no problems for some time now.
	-展示一下吧  -打印点什么
	- Show us. - Yeah, print something.
	好吧  你希望它更快点吗
	Fine, you want it faster?
	我还希望它能更便宜点
	Well, I'd like it cheaper, too.
	我听说IBM要推出一种
	You know, I hear IBM's coming out with
	多规格送纸打印机
	a multiple format paper feed.
	你哪听说的
	Where'd you hear that?
	我不该跟你们说的  但是
	I'm not supposed to tell you this, but...
	明年年初  我们就会发布一款多规格打印机
	We are coming out with a multiple format printer first of the year.
	如果我是你  就不挡我们的道
	If I were you, I'd get out of our way.
	那怎么办  就这么收拾东西走人吗
	What, just pack up and leave?
	我们为这次展会投入了全部
	We put everything into this.
	我很喜欢你们这样的人来跟我们斗  真的
	Look, I love when guys like you take us on, I really do.
	几年前  德卢斯有位先生
	A couple years ago, a gentleman out of Duluth
	自己写了一个文字处理软件  做得非常好
	developed his own word processor. Great features.
	但跟我们的同类产品撞个正着
	But it went head-to-head with DisplayWriter.
	-然后呢  -他妻子跑了  房子没了
	- What happened? - After his wife left him and he lost his house,
	后来他开车撞进了图书馆
	he drove his car into a library.
	他好像还在北部一家精神病院里治疗呢
	I think he's still recuperating in a mental hospital upstate.
	可我们已经入住了
	We already checked in.
	我们的套房一直订到了这周末
	The suite's paid up through the end of the week.
	我或许能帮上忙
	Maybe I can help.
	我们包了两层却还是住得爆满
	We rented two floors and we're still bursting at the seams.
	还有人睡在地毯上呢
	I got guys sleeping on the carpet.
	我们IBM没准能接手你们的套房呢
	You know, IBM might be able to take that suite off your hands.
	全价
	Full freight.
	我可不是想坑你们
	I'm not looking to screw you guys over.
	如果我们抵了开支的话
	If we could break even...
	那也是一大笔钱
	That would be huge.
	-只不过  -不过什么
	- Except... - What?
	我们今晚订的筵席
	The big spread we ordered for tonight.
	只怕这钱你们也得包了
	You'd have to eat that cost.
	那些虾啊
	All that shrimp.
	什么虾
	Shrimp?
	简直是拦路抢劫
	This is highway robbery.
	我们的展位本该在中间的
	Our booth was supposed to be in the middle.
	你来晚了  而且支票跳票了
	You're late and your check bounced.
	剩这一个算你运气好
	You're lucky I have this one left.
	你  赶紧下来  找摔呢
	Hey, get down from there before you hurt yourself.
	你订的用具都在这儿了
	All of your material as ordered.
	等等  我需要更多墙面
	Wait, I need more wall space.
	这这么一块破围板地方哪够啊
	I can't fit all this on one crummy backing.
	不关我事  女士
	Not my problem, lady.
	-要免费软件吗  -我的天
	- Free software? - Jesus.
	免费软件
	Free software.
	这倒也算个挣钱的法子
	That's one way to make a living.
	她们可不靠这个挣钱
	No, that's not their living.
	她们都是艳星  兼职"展会宝贝"
	They're porn stars moonlighting as "Booth babes."
	维加斯知道搞电脑的从不赌博
	Vegas figured out that computer types don't gamble,
	所以就在隔壁开了个黄片大会
	so they schedule a porn convention next door.
	年年与展会同期
	Same time every year.
	不是说套房里的才是重头戏吗
	I thought the action was in the suites.
	要是不引起他们注意
	Yeah, well, no one's coming
	谁又会去你的套房呢
	to our suite if we don't get their attention.
	怎么了
	What?
	你想干什么
	What are you doing?
	这样  我想法把他们拉到派对上
	Look, I'll get them to the party,
	你负责办个好派对  明白吗
	you make sure it's one to remember, okay?
	-谢谢你  -你好啊
	- Thank you. - Hi. How are you?
	负5  负12  等等
	Minus five. Minus 12, wait.
	-正5  -到底怎么了
	- plus five. - Bottom line, please.
	-开不了机  -暂时而已  也许没大事呢
	- It won't start. - Yet. Yet, okay? It's probably nothing.
	我们需要抗静电的工作间
	What we need is an antistatic workstation.
	把你鞋脱了  不是电源的问题
	Take off your shoes. It's not the power supply.
	收拾一下  去卧室里鼓捣
	Pack it up. We're moving into the bedroom.
	{\an8}手提箱里有巨人  来诺威克套房1475开眼界
	-喷漆干什么用的  -润色一下
	- What is that for? - Touch-ups.
	怎么了  出问题了吗  不能运行了
	What? What's the matter? Is it not working?
	暂时不能
	Not yet.
	什么意思  开不了机了
	Meaning what, it won't boot up?
	硬件上的事  你就别管了
	Hardware issue. Not your problem.
	麻烦你把衣服捡起来
	Pick up those clothes, please?
	一家小公司
	"A small company...
	背负着成不了大事的非议
	No one expected it to be anything...
	却终做出了伟大而非凡的成绩
	evolved into something great, something magnificent."
	不跟我们说说展位什么样吗
	You gonna tell us how the booth looks?
	会有人来吗
	Is anyone coming?
	我肯定会
	I would.
	-这里是卡迪夫电子吗  -是的
	- Is this Cardiff Electric? - Yes. Yes, it is.
	好的  真棒  我们上吧
	Okay. All right. Let's do it, man.
	真壮观
	Radical.
	-好诶  -快看这个
	- Yeah! - Hey, check this out.
	{\an8}卡迪夫电子
	我能再来三杯吗
	Hey, can I get three more?
	-没问题  -多谢
	- You got it. - Thanks.
	伙计  准备好了吗
	Hey! Hey, man, is it ready yet?
	{\an8}闲人勿入
	-准备好了吗  -没有
	- Is it ready yet? - No.
	我是说  快了
	I mean, almost.
	你都这么说了两小时了
	It's been "Almost" for two hours.
	速度和效果不可兼得
	You can have it fast or you can have it work.
	你自己决定
	It's up to you.
	拜托  施乐好歹是份工作嘛
	Oh, come on, Xerox is still a job.
	对帕洛阿尔托研究中心
	Not at PARC,
	那些发明以太网的人来说不是
	not to the guys who created Ethernet.
	这是纯粹的研究和实验
	This is pure research and experimentation.
	唐娜·克拉克
	Donna Clark.
	沃利·特纳  天哪  多久没见了
	Oh, Wally Turner. My God, how long has it been?
	你那时候刚怀了琼妮
	You were pregnant with, uh-- with Joanie.
	我现在有个新项目  写图
	Hey, I got this new program-- GraphWrite.
	界面是全彩的
	It's productivity fare,
	可以用各种大小的饼图和柱图显示数据
	sizable pie charts and histograms, all in full color.
	我说真的  你得去看看
	I'm serious. You have to see it.
	看什么
	See what?
	你们做的不都是机密吗
	I mean, isn't everything you guys do top secret?
	没错
	You're right.
	我不该和你说元类的事
	I shouldn't tell you about meta-classing
	或者超文本  又或者面向对象编程
	or hypertext or object-oriented programming.
	少来了
	Stop.
	戈登呢
	Hey, where's Gordon?
	他应该就来了
	Oh, he should be out any minute.
	真羡慕你俩还一起工作
	Love that you two are still working together.
	好多夫妻因为工作生活不能调和而分手了
	So many couples that break up over the home life-work life thing.
	我见过好多回了
	I've seen this a million times.
	但是你俩撑过了大风大浪
	But you guys, you've weathered the storm.
	恭喜你们的巨人
	Hey, congrats on the Giant.
	巨人  巨人  巨人
	Giant! Giant! Giant!
	还是无法装载  我可以重新配置驱动
	It's not mounting. I can reconfigure the drive,
	但是得花点时间
	but that's gonna take time.
	他们等不了这么久了
	They're not gonna wait much longer.
	唐娜  我当然知道了
	Donna, I'm well aware of that.
	太晚了  我们就这么上吧
	It's too late. We go without it.
	等下  你不用样机就去做演示吗
	Wait, you're gonna do the demo without the demo?
	这儿是拉斯维加斯  戈登
	It's Las Vegas, Gordon.
	-什么  乔  -该糊弄人了
	- Wha-- Joe...? - Time to bluff.
	等等  等等
	Wait! Wait!
	来  靠近点  都来看看  伙计们
	Come on, get close. Check it out, guys.
	想让我开机吗
	You guys want me to turn it on?
	就此时此刻吗
	Right here, right now?
	但是等一下
	But wait a second.
	等一下  等一下  等一下
	Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second.
	拉斯维加斯知道造一台电脑有多难
	See, Las Vegas knows how hard it is to build a computer.
	特别是这么一台又快又流畅的坏小子
	Especially one as sleek and fast as our little bad boy right here.
	但拉斯维加斯并不想知道
	But Las Vegas doesn't want to hear
	我们的886处理器比IBM XT快了70%
	that our 886 processor is running 70% faster than the IBM XT.
	它也不在乎我们的一体化液晶屏
	It doesn't care that our integrated LCD screen
	让巨人只有15磅重
	makes the Giant a featherlight 15 pounds,
	这小家伙便携  兼容  火辣得不行
	that it's fully portable, fully compatible, and sexy as hell.
	不  拉斯维加斯想让我们找乐子
	No, Las Vegas wants us to have fun!
	不然为什么我们隔壁
	Why else would it schedule
	就是世界上最大的成人片大会
	the world's largest porn convention right next door?
	这就不得不提到我们今晚的特邀嘉宾
	Which leads me to our special guest tonight.
	卡迪夫电子的贵宾
	The Cardiff Electric VIPs.
	Four lovely young ladies direct from the cinema.
	等等  我想先给大家看几张电子表格
	Wait, wait, wait. I wanna show you guys some spreadsheets.
	-不要  -那先看个文字处理软件吧
	- No! - Come on, let's do some word processing.
	什么  你们想看妹子吗
	Wait, you wanna meet the girls now,
	然后再看演示吗
	before the demo?
	好吧
	Okay, okay, okay.
	只要你们明天还来给我们捧场
	Only if you all catch up with us tomorrow on the floor.
	只要你们明天都来卡迪夫电子的展位
	Only if you all show up at the Cardiff Electric booth
	宿醉未醒  筋疲力尽
	hungover, wrung out,
	只为见证它在展会上一展风采
	just to watch this machine smoke every box in COMDEX.
	好吧  就这么定了
	All right, it's a deal.
	今晚  就让"巨人"来调动大家的兴致吧
	So, tonight let's let the Giant turn you on.
	永远别告诉女儿们我干了这事
	Please never tell our daughters I was a part of this.
	我才不会呢
	Why would I?
	卡迪夫电子
	Cardiff Electric!
	一般一年两次
	Uh, usually, like, twice a year.
	一次是为展览会  一次就是消遣
	Once for COMDEX, once just for fun.
	消遣  听起来真好
	For fun -- that sounds really nice.
	你一定得来
	You have to come visit.
	不是说达拉斯不好  电视里看着不错
	Nothing against Dallas. It looks great on TV.
	但是重头戏都在加利福尼亚
	But California's where it's at.
	而且你还这么年轻
	And you're young.
	-我考虑一下  -还有什么好考虑的
	- I'll think about it. - What is there to think about?
	-地震频发带  -我都感觉不到了
	- Earthquakes. - I don't feel them anymore.
	-邪教  连环杀手  -那是洛杉矶
	- Cults? Serial killers? - That's all down in Los Angeles.
	-感恩而死  -你太坏了
	- The Grateful Dead. - Wow, you are mean.
	{\pos(162,252)}乐队
	我饿了  你想吃点薄饼吗
	I'm hungry. You want some pancakes?
	有人想吃薄饼吗
	Hey, you guys want pancakes?
	-薄饼  -当然
	- Pancakes? - Hell, yeah.
	-想要  -走吧
	- Oh, yeah. - Let's go.
	-走吧  -好
	- Let's do it. - Yeah.
	如果"巨人"真像你说的那样
	If the Giant does everything you say...
	我们或许可以考虑
	it could be a contender for us.
	你可别拿我寻开心  丹尼斯
	Don't tease me if you're not for real, Dennis.

	电脑零售业就是我们发明的
	We invented computer retail.
	我保证我们是认真的
	I can assure you, we're real.
	那为什么要买德州一家无名小公司的特色产品呢
	Then why buy a specialty product from a podunk firm in Texas?
	你卖过车吗  乔
	You ever sell cars for a living, Joe?
	没有
	No, never.
	我就是卖车起家的
	That's how I got started.
	我学到的是如果你想卖旅行轿车
	And I learned if you wanna sell station wagons,
	橱窗里得先放辆跑车
	you'd better have a sports car to park in the window.
	很期待你们明天的展示
	Looking forward to your demo tomorrow.
	在转了  应该可以了
	It's spinning. That should do it.
	装载吧
	Load 'er up.
	太棒了
	Yes.
	终于好了
	Finally.
	{\an8}你叫什么名字
	{\an8}感谢上帝
	{\an8}你好  感谢上帝  你想做什么
	蜜月之后就再没这么做过了
	Haven't done that since our honeymoon.

	What? With who?
	和谁啊
	Who?
	我们给他盖个毯子吧
	Should we get him a blanket?
	才不要  我们换个房间吧
	Hell, no. We're switching rooms.
	你真觉得它能大卖吗
	Do you really think it'll sell?
	如果展示成功的话
	If we nail the demo.
	那就太好了
	This could be so good.
	对女儿  对我们
	For the girls, for us.
	这些年我们都只是有一天过一天
	For so long we've just gotten by.
	感觉很奇怪吧
	It's weird, huh?
	这就叫成功吧
	I think they call it success.
	沃利·特纳来过  你见着他了吗
	Wally Turner dropped by. Did you see him?
	嗯  他向我推销了一通
	Yeah, he cornered me with his sales pitch.

	Still all about Wally.
	我喜欢他软件的新点子
	I like his new software idea.
	是啊  我说会在"巨人"上试试的
	Yeah, I told him we'd spec it out on the Giant.
	沃利以为咱俩还是同事
	Wally thinks we still work together.
	是吗  你怎么说的
	Yeah? What'd you tell him?
	还能怎么说  我喜欢这份没前途的工作
	What am I gonna say? I'm really enjoying my dead-end job
	喜欢找老妈帮我看孩子吗
	and having my mom raise my kids?
	派对上说这个不合适吧
	It's not exactly cocktail chatter.
	你说什么呢  唐娜
	What are you talking about, Donna?
	这项目有多少次都多亏了你
	You saved this project a dozen times.
	没有你就造不出主板

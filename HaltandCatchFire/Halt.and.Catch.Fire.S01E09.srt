1
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,050
还有多远
How much longer?

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,650
大概三百英里吧
300 miles, give or take.

3
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,120
几点能到维加斯
What time do we get to Vegas?

4
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,400
上午9点吗
9:00 a.m.?

5
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,800
杂物箱里有餐巾纸
There's napkins in the glove box.

6
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,310
{\an8}巨人

7
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,280
结语不错  有神秘感
Nice ending. Mysterious.

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,630
吊他们的胃口
Leave 'em wanting more.

9
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,940
我们紧张个什么劲啊
Why are we freaking out about this, anyway?

10
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,200
这是场展销会
I mean, it's a trade show.

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,550
他们想要巨人  压力大的该是他们
They want the Giant. The pressure's on them.

12
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,190
你以为那些分销商
Okay, you think thousands of vendors

13
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,620
会神奇地聚在我们展位前吗
are just gonna magically swarm our booth?

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,760
-当然了  会排起长队的  -重点不在展位
- Hell, yes. Get in line. - The booth isn't the point.

15
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,010
那只是用来辨别真正的买家
That's just a way to identify the real buyers

16
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,180
然后拉去我们的套房
and then get them up to our suite.

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,470
参加首展晚会派对
For the opening night party.

18
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,270
没错  套房里的才是重头戏
Yeah, suite's where the action is.

19
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,790
交易都是在那里敲定的
It's where we nail down all the real deals.

20
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:08,980
大家都很忐忑
Everybody's terrified.

21
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,930
没人知道哪种技术能赢得青睐
Nobody knows which technology's gonna win.

22
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,000
你的朋友想坑你
Oh, your friends are trying to rip you off.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,570
敌人对你示好
Your enemies are buying you drinks.

24
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,140
竞争很激烈  乱极了
It's a catfight. It's total chaos.

25
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,810
简直是资本主义的最高境界
It's capitalism at its finest.

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,380
在苏格兰群岛
In the Scottish Isles,

27
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,950
人们在一年中最冷的那天庆祝节日
they hold a festival on the coldest day of the year.

28
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,510
镇上的人穿上维京人的服装
The town's people dress up in Viking costumes

29
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,780
分组比赛
and compete in squads,

30
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,770
载歌载舞  纵情畅饮
drinking and singing and dancing.

31
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,260
最后到午夜
Finally at midnight,

32
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,010
他们会来到位于镇广场的巨型木船前
they march up to a huge wooden ship in the town square.

33
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,630
然后呢
Then what?

34
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,290
胜者们会把船烧毁
Then the winners burn it to the ground.

35
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,850
你跟我们说这个干嘛
Why the hell did you just tell us that?

36
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:18,500
{\an8}欢迎来到83年计算机分销商展览

37
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,880
早上好  登记入住吗
Good mning. Checking in?

38
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,640
卡迪夫电子
Cardiff Electric.

39
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,910
我们在9楼订了一间三卧套房
We have a three-bedroom suite on the ninth floor.

40
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,770
好的  请您先填写一下登记卡
Excellent. If you'd just fill out your registration card.

41
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,180
抱歉  您刚才说卡迪夫吗
I'm sorry, did you say Cardiff?

42
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,030
-是啊  -失陪一下
- That's right. - Excuse me for one moment.

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,130
-我是经理  -我是约翰·博斯沃思
- I'm the manager. - Uh, John Bosworth.

44
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,620
-有问题吗  -恐怕是有
- Is there a problem? - I'm afraid so.

45
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,510
我们今早刷了您的信用卡  但是被拒付了
We ran your card this morning and it was declined.

46
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,570
我们打了电话  但是没人接听
We tried to call, but no answer.

47
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,470
很不幸  我们只能取消了您预约的房间
Unfortunately, we had no choice but to release your room.

48
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,770
太荒谬了
That's absurd.

49
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,490
-我要给信用卡公司打电话  -我们已经打了
- Let me call the credit card company. - We already did.

50
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,810
您的公司账户被冻结了
Your corporate account has been frozen...

51
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,450
因为要接受刑事调查
due to a pending criminal investigation.

52
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,680
那就刷我的卡吧
Here, take a personal card.

53
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,110
刷这张绝对没问题
You won't have any problem with this.

54
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,230
"乔瑟夫·麦克米伦"
"Joseph MacMillan."

55
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,910
您不是约翰·博斯沃思吗
I thought you were John Bosworth.

56
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,620
能付钱不就行吗
If I can pay, what does it matter?

57
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,060
抱歉  房间都订满了
I'm sorry, we're fully booked.

58
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,470
我可以每晚再加200块
I'm willing to add a $200 premium per night.

59
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,200
等着要那间房的就有30个人
I have a waiting list 30 names long for that room.

60
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,200
没犯法的正经人
Legitimate names.

61
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,240
现在怎么办
So, what now?

62
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,980
展位没了
We lost our booth.

63
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,100
楼层经理说他也许能给我们挤出个位置
The floor manager said he might be able to squeeze us in.

64
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,860
我20分钟后就得答复
I'm supposed to get back to him in 20 minutes.

65
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,000
正好给了我们找其他酒店的时间
Well, that gives us time to find another hotel.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,050
展会就在隔壁
The expo's right next door.

67
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,460
离开主街我们就失去了据点和人气
We move off the Strip, we lose our base, all our walk-in traffic.

68
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,490
欢迎宴会就在今晚  所有人都住在这儿
Our welcoming party's tonight. Everyone stays here.

69
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,190
但都订满了  我们能怎么办  贿赂吗
But it's booked. What are we supposed to do, bribe somebody?

70
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,010
-我试过了  -我们可是在拉斯维加斯
- I tried that. - Christ, we're in Las Vegas.

71
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,000
有一万一千美金现款
We have $11,000 in cash.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,260
我们就不能想想办法吗
Can we get off our asses and make a move?

73
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,640
质子打印机  1475套房
Hey, Protonix Printers, suite 1475.

74
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,180
那对桑尼维尔市的兄弟  记得吗
Those brothers from Sunnyvale, remember?

75
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,350
不记得
No.

76
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,940
81年展会上他们大概和我们隔六个展位
They were, like, six booths away from us in '81.

77
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,440
我记得他们的演示  糟透了
I remember their demo. It sucked.

78
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,570
打给楼层经理  安排会面
Call the floor manager. Set the meet.

79
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,440
不管位置在哪  价格多贵
I don't care where it is or how much it costs,

80
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,940
拿到展位就行
just get us a booth.

81
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,250
你找来你最好的蓝色西装去洗手间换上
You, find your best blue suit and change in the bathroom.

82
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,000
-我们要干嘛  -在这里搞到个房间
- What are we doing? - We're gonna make room in the inn.

83
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,320
来吧  赶紧的
Come on, hustle up.

84
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,950
在文本模式下  打印机是逻辑查找的
In text mode, the printer is logic-seeking.

85
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,770
你一定会问  这是什么意思
What do I mean by that, you ask?

86
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,840
{\an8}盛会大师  质子打印机

87
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,240
这意味着它的打印头可以双向移动
I mean it can print with its head moving in both directions.

88
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,640
是的  你没听错
Yes, you heard that right.

89
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,260
你的MX-80点阵打印机
Now, your average dot matrix printer, your DMP,

90
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,260
{\pos(182,252)}爱普生1980年推出的经典打印机

91
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,760
限制了你打印成品的大小必须符合标准
your MX-80, restricts you to a standard output size.

92
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,460
这适用于打印商业信函
Which is fine for business letters

93
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,040
和普通会计材料等等
and general accounting and such...

94
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,290
但那些更私人化的情况呢
But what about those moments that demand a more personal touch?

95
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,090
这就是盛会大师大展身手之机了
That's where the OccasionMaster steps in.

96
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,400
预先设定的字体  气球和动感的图形
With our pre-set fonts and balloons and sparkles graphics,

97
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,590
一定会给你最亲爱的人另一番感受
your near and dearest are guaranteed a special feeling.

98
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,120
来看结果吧  分发些样品  小皮
Result-- let's pass out those samples, Petey.

99
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,900
从露天招待会到单身派对
From the garden party to the bachelor party,

100
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,560
盛会大师是真正的...
the OccasionMaster is truly...

101
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,210
庆典大师
Your master of ceremonies.

102
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,210
{\pos(252,276)}本意为司仪

103
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,150
有什么问题吗
Any questions?

104
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,830
串行还是并行接口
Serial port or parallel?

105
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,230
现在只有并行接口
Well, it's just parallel for now,

106
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,580
但我们希望能在未来改进这一点
but that's something that we hope to upgrade in the future.

107
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,370
你们要价多少
And you're asking how much for it?

108
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,580
九百美元不含税
Oh, uh, $900 plus tax.

109
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,380
每秒打印字符数是多少
What's the CPS rate?

110
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,770
80到100吧  不一定
It's 80 to 100, depending.

111
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,130
所以说我花了一千块
So, I'm supposed to pay a thousand dollars

112
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,770
还要等上20分钟才能打印一封我只要花5分钟
to wait 20 minutes for that thing to spit out a thank-you note

113
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,510
就能写好的感谢信
when I can write my own in five?

114
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:23,020
每秒打印100个字符已经相当快了
100 CPS is quite fast, my friend.

115
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,010
但也没快得像闪电啊
Yeah, well, let's not act like it's lightning.

116
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,120
尤其是打印图片的时候
Especially with the graphics.

117
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,680
你不能调整下打印头让它更快些吗
Can't you modify the head to go any faster?

118
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,600
我们一直在测试盛会大师
We've been testing the OM

119
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,800
至今没有发现什么问题
with no problems for some time now.

120
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,890
-展示一下吧  -打印点什么
- Show us. - Yeah, print something.

121
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,290
好吧  你希望它更快点吗
Fine, you want it faster?

122
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,750
我还希望它能更便宜点
Well, I'd like it cheaper, too.

123
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,020
我听说IBM要推出一种
You know, I hear IBM's coming out with

124
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,020
多规格送纸打印机
a multiple format paper feed.

125
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,000
你哪听说的
Where'd you hear that?

126
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,020
我不该跟你们说的  但是
I'm not supposed to tell you this, but...

127
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,710
明年年初  我们就会发布一款多规格打印机
We are coming out with a multiple format printer first of the year.

128
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,040
如果我是你  就不挡我们的道
If I were you, I'd get out of our way.

129
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,220
那怎么办  就这么收拾东西走人吗
What, just pack up and leave?

130
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,980
我们为这次展会投入了全部
We put everything into this.

131
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,480
我很喜欢你们这样的人来跟我们斗  真的
Look, I love when guys like you take us on, I really do.

132
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,650
几年前  德卢斯有位先生
A couple years ago, a gentleman out of Duluth

133
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,280
自己写了一个文字处理软件  做得非常好
developed his own word processor. Great features.

134
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,950
但跟我们的同类产品撞个正着
But it went head-to-head with DisplayWriter.

135
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,480
-然后呢  -他妻子跑了  房子没了
- What happened? - After his wife left him and he lost his house,

136
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,640
后来他开车撞进了图书馆
he drove his car into a library.

137
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,850
他好像还在北部一家精神病院里治疗呢
I think he's still recuperating in a mental hospital upstate.

138
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,190
可我们已经入住了
We already checked in.

139
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,200
我们的套房一直订到了这周末
The suite's paid up through the end of the week.

140
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,020
我或许能帮上忙
Maybe I can help.

141
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,990
我们包了两层却还是住得爆满
We rented two floors and we're still bursting at the seams.

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,630
还有人睡在地毯上呢
I got guys sleeping on the carpet.

143
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:55,200
我们IBM没准能接手你们的套房呢
You know, IBM might be able to take that suite off your hands.

144
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,470
全价
Full freight.

145
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,420
我可不是想坑你们
I'm not looking to screw you guys over.

146
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,970
如果我们抵了开支的话
If we could break even...

147
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,190
那也是一大笔钱
That would be huge.

148
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,100
-只不过  -不过什么
- Except... - What?

149
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,470
我们今晚订的筵席
The big spread we ordered for tonight.

150
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,950
只怕这钱你们也得包了
You'd have to eat that cost.

151
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,470
那些虾啊
All that shrimp.

152
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,420
什么虾
Shrimp?

153
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,060
简直是拦路抢劫
This is highway robbery.

154
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,320
我们的展位本该在中间的
Our booth was supposed to be in the middle.

155
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,480
你来晚了  而且支票跳票了
You're late and your check bounced.

156
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,710
剩这一个算你运气好
You're lucky I have this one left.

157
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,520
你  赶紧下来  找摔呢
Hey, get down from there before you hurt yourself.

158
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,410
你订的用具都在这儿了
All of your material as ordered.

159
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,790
等等  我需要更多墙面
Wait, I need more wall space.

160
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,190
这这么一块破围板地方哪够啊
I can't fit all this on one crummy backing.

161
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,000
不关我事  女士
Not my problem, lady.

162
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,250
-要免费软件吗  -我的天
- Free software? - Jesus.

163
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,710
免费软件
Free software.

164
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,160
这倒也算个挣钱的法子
That's one way to make a living.

165
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,240
她们可不靠这个挣钱
No, that's not their living.

166
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,290
她们都是艳星  兼职"展会宝贝"
They're porn stars moonlighting as "Booth babes."

167
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,440
维加斯知道搞电脑的从不赌博
Vegas figured out that computer types don't gamble,

168
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,430
所以就在隔壁开了个黄片大会
so they schedule a porn convention next door.

169
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,360
年年与展会同期
Same time every year.

170
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,000
不是说套房里的才是重头戏吗
I thought the action was in the suites.

171
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,200
要是不引起他们注意
Yeah, well, no one's coming

172
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,250
谁又会去你的套房呢
to our suite if we don't get their attention.

173
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,460
怎么了
What?

174
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,020
你想干什么
What are you doing?

175
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,130
这样  我想法把他们拉到派对上
Look, I'll get them to the party,

176
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,000
你负责办个好派对  明白吗
you make sure it's one to remember, okay?

177
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,400
-谢谢你  -你好啊
- Thank you. - Hi. How are you?

178
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,790
负5  负12  等等
Minus five. Minus 12, wait.

179
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,730
-正5  -到底怎么了
- plus five. - Bottom line, please.

180
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,160
-开不了机  -暂时而已  也许没大事呢
- It won't start. - Yet. Yet, okay? It's probably nothing.

181
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,930
我们需要抗静电的工作间
What we need is an antistatic workstation.

182
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,370
把你鞋脱了  不是电源的问题
Take off your shoes. It's not the power supply.

183
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,820
收拾一下  去卧室里鼓捣
Pack it up. We're moving into the bedroom.

184
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:35,730
{\an8}手提箱里有巨人  来诺威克套房1475开眼界

185
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,780
-喷漆干什么用的  -润色一下
- What is that for? - Touch-ups.

186
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,530
怎么了  出问题了吗  不能运行了
What? What's the matter? Is it not working?

187
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,660
暂时不能
Not yet.

188
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,940
什么意思  开不了机了
Meaning what, it won't boot up?

189
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,740
硬件上的事  你就别管了
Hardware issue. Not your problem.

190
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,500
麻烦你把衣服捡起来
Pick up those clothes, please?

191
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,670
一家小公司
"A small company...

192
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,620
背负着成不了大事的非议
No one expected it to be anything...

193
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,940
却终做出了伟大而非凡的成绩
evolved into something great, something magnificent."

194
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,260
不跟我们说说展位什么样吗
You gonna tell us how the booth looks?

195
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,130
会有人来吗
Is anyone coming?

196
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,220
我肯定会
I would.

197
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,330
-这里是卡迪夫电子吗  -是的
- Is this Cardiff Electric? - Yes. Yes, it is.

198
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,680
好的  真棒  我们上吧
Okay. All right. Let's do it, man.

199
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,260
真壮观
Radical.

200
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,350
-好诶  -快看这个
- Yeah! - Hey, check this out.

201
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,840
{\an8}卡迪夫电子

202
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,070
我能再来三杯吗
Hey, can I get three more?

203
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,240
-没问题  -多谢
- You got it. - Thanks.

204
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,790
伙计  准备好了吗
Hey! Hey, man, is it ready yet?

205
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,780
{\an8}闲人勿入

206
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,960
-准备好了吗  -没有
- Is it ready yet? - No.

207
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,650
我是说  快了
I mean, almost.

208
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,980
你都这么说了两小时了
It's been "Almost" for two hours.

209
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,040
速度和效果不可兼得
You can have it fast or you can have it work.

210
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,190
你自己决定
It's up to you.

211
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,290
拜托  施乐好歹是份工作嘛
Oh, come on, Xerox is still a job.

212
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,670
对帕洛阿尔托研究中心
Not at PARC,

213
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,190
那些发明以太网的人来说不是
not to the guys who created Ethernet.

214
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,030
这是纯粹的研究和实验
This is pure research and experimentation.

215
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,450
唐娜·克拉克
Donna Clark.

216
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,440
沃利·特纳  天哪  多久没见了
Oh, Wally Turner. My God, how long has it been?

217
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,080
你那时候刚怀了琼妮
You were pregnant with, uh-- with Joanie.

218
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,160
我现在有个新项目  写图
Hey, I got this new program-- GraphWrite.

219
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,230
界面是全彩的
It's productivity fare,

220
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,990
可以用各种大小的饼图和柱图显示数据
sizable pie charts and histograms, all in full color.

221
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,250
我说真的  你得去看看
I'm serious. You have to see it.

222
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,270
看什么
See what?

223
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,660
你们做的不都是机密吗
I mean, isn't everything you guys do top secret?

224
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,600
没错
You're right.

225
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,000
我不该和你说元类的事
I shouldn't tell you about meta-classing

226
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,010
或者超文本  又或者面向对象编程
or hypertext or object-oriented programming.

227
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,300
少来了
Stop.

228
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,830
戈登呢
Hey, where's Gordon?

229
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,970
他应该就来了
Oh, he should be out any minute.

230
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,950
真羡慕你俩还一起工作
Love that you two are still working together.

231
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,650
好多夫妻因为工作生活不能调和而分手了
So many couples that break up over the home life-work life thing.

232
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,090
我见过好多回了
I've seen this a million times.

233
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,460
但是你俩撑过了大风大浪
But you guys, you've weathered the storm.

234
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,540
恭喜你们的巨人
Hey, congrats on the Giant.

235
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,840
巨人  巨人  巨人
Giant! Giant! Giant!

236
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,180
还是无法装载  我可以重新配置驱动
It's not mounting. I can reconfigure the drive,

237
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,220
但是得花点时间
but that's gonna take time.

238
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,550
他们等不了这么久了
They're not gonna wait much longer.

239
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,460
唐娜  我当然知道了
Donna, I'm well aware of that.

240
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,160
太晚了  我们就这么上吧
It's too late. We go without it.

241
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,870
等下  你不用样机就去做演示吗
Wait, you're gonna do the demo without the demo?

242
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,130
这儿是拉斯维加斯  戈登
It's Las Vegas, Gordon.

243
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,970
-什么  乔  -该糊弄人了
- Wha-- Joe...? - Time to bluff.

244
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,730
等等  等等
Wait! Wait!

245
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,020
来  靠近点  都来看看  伙计们
Come on, get close. Check it out, guys.

246
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,790
想让我开机吗
You guys want me to turn it on?

247
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,970
就此时此刻吗
Right here, right now?

248
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,250
但是等一下
But wait a second.

249
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,560
等一下  等一下  等一下
Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second.

250
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,770
拉斯维加斯知道造一台电脑有多难
See, Las Vegas knows how hard it is to build a computer.

251
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,160
特别是这么一台又快又流畅的坏小子
Especially one as sleek and fast as our little bad boy right here.

252
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,720
但拉斯维加斯并不想知道
But Las Vegas doesn't want to hear

253
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,300
我们的886处理器比IBM XT快了70%
that our 886 processor is running 70% faster than the IBM XT.

254
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,640
它也不在乎我们的一体化液晶屏
It doesn't care that our integrated LCD screen

255
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,470
让巨人只有15磅重
makes the Giant a featherlight 15 pounds,

256
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:45,090
这小家伙便携  兼容  火辣得不行
that it's fully portable, fully compatible, and sexy as hell.

257
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,240
不  拉斯维加斯想让我们找乐子
No, Las Vegas wants us to have fun!

258
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,750
不然为什么我们隔壁
Why else would it schedule

259
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,680
就是世界上最大的成人片大会
the world's largest porn convention right next door?

260
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,570
这就不得不提到我们今晚的特邀嘉宾
Which leads me to our special guest tonight.

261
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,200
卡迪夫电子的贵宾
The Cardiff Electric VIPs.

262
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,900
4位来自大银幕的漂亮的年轻小姐
Four lovely young ladies direct from the cinema.

263
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,440
等等  我想先给大家看几张电子表格
Wait, wait, wait. I wanna show you guys some spreadsheets.

264
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,840
-不要  -那先看个文字处理软件吧
- No! - Come on, let's do some word processing.

265
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,120
什么  你们想看妹子吗
Wait, you wanna meet the girls now,

266
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,630
然后再看演示吗
before the demo?

267
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,470
好吧
Okay, okay, okay.

268
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,940
只要你们明天还来给我们捧场
Only if you all catch up with us tomorrow on the floor.

269
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,090

00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,020
双面主板
a doubleided motherboard...

409
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:38,110
-唐娜  -功能多样
- Donna... - ...packed with functionality.

410
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:43,830
强劲  迅速  简单
So strong, so fast, so simple,

411
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,610
居然以前都没人想到
it's a wonder no one thought of it before.

412
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,380
弹弓
The Slingshot.

413
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,330
{\an8}弹弓  新  快  简单  强劲

414
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,010
哥利亚也最终发现
Because, as Goliath found out,

415

{\pos(172,252)}《圣经》中被大卫杀死的巨人

416
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:09,490
胜利不属于敏捷或强壮的人
victory goes not to the swift, nor to the strong,

417
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,180
而属于先下手的那小子
but to the little guy who strikes first.

418
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,070
有问题吗
Any questions?

419
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,000
你这个混蛋
Damn you, you son of a bitch!

420
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,860
-唐娜  -我杀了你
- Hey, Donna! - I'm gonna kill you--

421
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,010
-别碰他  -唐娜  走吧
- Get off him! - Donna, come on.

422
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,410
唐娜  算了  走吧
Donna, let's go, come on.

423
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,570
没事了
Okay, okay.

424
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,630
报复挺不好受吧
Payback's a bitch.

425
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,060
他们抄了我们的电脑  肯定得有设计图啊
But they copied our machine. They need schematics for that.

426
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,220
这是商业间谍行为
This is corporate espionage. 

427
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,480
我得查清他们偷了什么  造成多大损失
I need to know what was compromised and the extent of the damage.

428
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,690
-别进来  -什么
- Out. - What?

429
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,320
我从没把任何东西拿去德州仪器
I never brought anything to T.I.

430
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,670
我接过电话
There were phone calls. 

431
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:59,550
或许他听到了什么
Maybe he overheard--or-- or that--

432
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,910
-你寄到酒店的传真  -你跟他上床了吗
- the fax you sent to the hotel.  - Are you sleeping with him?

433
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,430
回答我
Answer the question.

434
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,520
-你在跟他上床吗  -没有
- Are you sleeping with him? - No.

435
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,460
我吻过他  就一次
I kissed him, once.

436
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,840
你吻了他  不是倒过来吗
Yeah, you kissed him and not the other way around?

437
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,400
是的  戈登  我吻了他
Yeah, Gordon. Yeah, I kissed him.

438
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,860
那两秒半里
And for two and a half seconds,

439
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,470
我比这两年来都快乐
I felt better than I've felt in two years.

440
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,830
天呐  唐娜  你真幼稚
Christ, Donna, you're a child.

441
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,660
根本没什么幼稚可言
There was nothing childish about it.

442
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,910
-我想要他  而且我有原因  -唐娜
- I wanted him, and there were reasons. - Donna, he--

443
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,520
-唐娜  -这些原因源自你我之间的问题
- Donna-- - There were you-and-me reasons

444
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,820
因为你不能假装
because you can't pretend we were 

445
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,010
-我们之间一切都好  -他利用了你
- on some moonlit carriage ride. - He used you! He used you!

446
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,720
至少他鼓动还回报了我
At least he encouraged me and rewarded me. 

447
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,980
你真相信他吗  你被蒙蔽了  唐娜
You believe that? You're blind, Donna.

448
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,820
你根本看不清他的真正目的
You never even saw what he was doing!

449
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,940
你从来不曾对我有任何的帮助
And you never even picked me up out of a hole in the ground.

450
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:45,440
我帮过你那么多次  照顾你和孩子
I lifted you up so many times. I carried you and the kids.

451
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,200
我那么累  那么难过  你却毫不在乎
And I was tired and miserable and you didn't give a shit.

452
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,810
我们之间没什么  但本该有什么的
It wasn't an affair, but it should've been.

453
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:56,500
好啊  去吧  你既然都决定了
All right. Go on, then. You've made your decision.

454
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,600
-天呐  -你去前台
- Oh, my God. - You go down to the front desk

455
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,820
问他住哪
and you ask for his suite number!

456
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,250
他一定会给你腾地方的
I'm sure he'll make room for you!

457
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,750
难道你就不是
Like you didn't pick the Giant over me

458
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,960
总把巨人放在我之前吗
every second of every single day.

459
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,470
唐娜  你真老套
Oh, my God, Donna. Donna, you're a clich?

460
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,090
你们俩  就是我们的努力成果的廉价山寨
Both of you. Just a cheap rip-off of something that we built together.

461
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,750
-我倒想去  但已经没机会了  -是吗  去啊
- I would go, but it's all ruined for me now, - Yeah? Go.

462
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,300
-你就想如此  -去吧
- because that's what you want. - Go.

463
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,320
你宁可正确  而不是要我
You want to be right more than you want me.

464
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,850
唐娜  或许你父母就是看对我了
You know what, Donna? Maybe your parents were right about me.

465
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:23,100
我就是个狭隘  小气  怨愤的暴君
I'm just a small-minded, petty, resentful little tyrant.

466
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,940
有时候是酒鬼  永远是个废物父亲
You know, part-time alcoholic, full-time failure as a father!

467
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,260
但我清楚我们曾经的感情  唐娜
But I knew what I had with you, Donna.

468
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,520
而且我一直在努力对得起这份感情
And I never stopped trying to live up to that.

469
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,010
对你  唐娜  我从未放弃过
To you, Donna. To you, I never, ever gave up.

470
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,730
他们改主意了
They changed their mind.

471
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,510
我们的操作系统  我们的设计  他们才不管
Our dynamic OS, our design-- they don't care.

472
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,940
他们就想要旅行轿车
They want a station wagon.

473
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:13,930
弹弓更快  更便宜
The Slingshot's faster, it's cheaper.

474
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,660
我们没戏了
So we're dead.

475
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,210
听到了吗  戈登
Did you hear that, Gordon?

476
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,040
他们圣诞就能上架
They'll be in stores by Christmas.

477
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,740
我真替你难过
My heart goes out to you.

478
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,330
我能想象这多令人痛心
I know how painful this must be.

479
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,970
但两条道路交汇时
But when two paths converge,

480
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,790
不管是有意还是无意
intentionally or not,

481
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,520
他们未必会一起延续下去
they don't always continue on together.

482
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,980
一条路向前推进
One peels off,

483
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,080
另一条到此为止
the other dead-ends.

484
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,040
就别扯什么"林子里的两条路"了
Let's skip the "Two Roads in a Wood" bullshit. 

485
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,040
{\an3}{\pos(380,252)}指罗伯特·弗罗斯特的诗《未选之路》

486
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,850
你又不是罗伯特·弗罗斯特
You're not Robert Frost.

487
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,530
你就是当铺的小工
You're pawnshop hacks

488
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,230
把我的梦想廉价包装卖掉
selling my dream under a cheap plastic mask.

489
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,160
早听说你这人挺敏感
I heard you were touchy.

490
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,680
液晶屏  哪找来的  台湾货船吗
That LCD screen, where did you find it, a Taiwanese barge?

491
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,020
向我们道歉  撤掉你们的产品
Apologize, pull your product, 

492
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,590
我或许不会告你
and I'll consider not suing.

493
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,870
诉诸法律毫无好处  乔
There's no upside to litigation, Joe.

494
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,000
等我们真上了法庭
By the time you get in front of a jury,

495
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,040
我们第三代产品都出了
we'll be on our third generation.

496
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,050
而且你们的BIOS不也是克隆IBM
And good luck persuading them that your BIOS

497
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,980
你要怎么让陪审团觉得这就比我们强
is such a nobler copy of IBM's than ours.

498
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,550
我们先做到了  认栽吧
We got there first. Deal with it.

499
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,150
你一定很自豪吧
You must be proud.

500
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:24,210
雇我们不要的人  从对手妻子那儿打探秘密
Hiring our sloppy seconds, pumping a competitor's wife.

501
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,000
这么做生意真行
That's one way to do business.

502
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,610
机会自己送上门的
The opportunity presented itself.

503
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,180
我没有犯法
No laws were broken.

504
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,500
难道你不会这么做吗
Are you telling me you'd do different?

505
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,380
-给我小心点  -得了吧
- I'd be more careful. - Oh, please.

506
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,450
你们高级副总裁在面临指控
Your SVP's under indictment,

507
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,270
你跟你的主程序员上床
you're sleeping with your lead coder,

508
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:42,110
更别提阿蒙克的那件事
not to mention that little incident back in Armonk.

509
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,030
我说得对不对
Let me see if I get this right.

510
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,620
你跟你父亲起了争执
Following an argument with your father,

511
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,230
随后你就损坏了总水管
you ruptured a water main,

512
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,700
淹了一个IBM的数据中心
flooded an entire IBM data center?

513
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,100
爸爸一定把你气得不轻吧
Daddy musta made you pretty angry.

514
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:59,590
没错  我查过你的底
Oh, yeah. I did my homework on you, all right.

515
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,660
纽约"喜欢"你的人不少呢
You got quite the fan club back there in New York.

516
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,310
认得这个号码吗
You recognize that number?

517
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,490
那是你老板内森·卡迪夫的号码
That's your boss, Nathan Cardiff.

518
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,280
你上楼去给他打电话
Now, you're gonna go upstairs, you're gonna call him,

519
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,660
告诉他我出两百万
and tell him that I offered you $2 million 

520
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,660
弹弓的股份买巨人
in Slingshot stock for the Giant.

521
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,380
这可比和解你能拿到的钱多多了
Which is more than you're gonna get in the settlement.

522
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,820
我们为什么要卖给你们
Why would we sell to you?

523
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,670
因为这能填补你们开发用钱留下的坑
'Cause that covers your R&D nut, gets you out whole

524
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,090
否则你们会坐失一切
as opposed to losing everything for nothing.

525
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,930
然后你把我们拆了散卖吗
Then you strip us for parts? 

526
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,420
那台电脑还是有些可取之处的  乔
There's some good ideas in that machine, Joe.

527
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,960
你错就错在爱上了那个
Your mistake was falling in love with 

528
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,850
互动操作系统
that precious query-based interface.

529
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:38,160
它或许是很超前  但太占内存
Maybe it's ahead of its time, but it's a memory hog.

530
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,280
我们绝不会卖给你
We'll never sell to you.

531
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,990
等我们跟电脑天地签约  这就是标配了
After we sign with ComputerLand, it's academic.

532
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,620
接不接受随你吧
Take it or not.

533
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:49,150
告诉唐娜  别往心里去
Oh, and tell Donna it wasn't personal.

534
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,650
我真替你遗憾  惠特马什先生
I feel sorry for you, Mr. Whitmarsh.

535
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,180
你骗了你自己
You cheated yourself.

536
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,820
你永远造不出属于你自己的东西
You'll never create anything of your own.

537
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,490
你不也一样
Well, neither will you.

538
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,010
别忘了  我们做的是兼容机
You seem to have forgotten, we're in the compatible business.

539
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,670
你想出类拔萃

it's funny how much better it tastes

怎么样了

Fine, I guess.

这样比弹弓快  还便宜一百块
It'll beat the Slingshot on speed and be a hundred bucks cheaper.

You took it out.

你拿走了让它独特的东西

他错了  这样不对
He's wrong. This is wrong.

天呐

是为了维持下去
It's an existential choice.

好吧  那...我想要你去呢

"How well and how fast does it do the things I ask?"

回答是"立刻马上"  否则就是浪费你的时间

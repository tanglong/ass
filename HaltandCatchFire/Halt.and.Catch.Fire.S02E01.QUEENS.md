	-小心  -我以为新装的电话线

	你好  我叫切特·詹森  用户句柄极限极客
	Hi, my name is Chet Jensen, user handle Kickassasaurus.
	我想报告一个视差游戏的程序错误
	I'd like to report a programming error in "Parallax."
	那个有一堆镜子的走廊没有门
	The narrow hall with a bunch of mirrors has no door.
	不  那些不是镜子  是全息图
	No, not mirrors, holograms.
	我糊涂了
	Oh, flummoxing.
	但如果我说"看全息图"
	But if I say, "Look at hologram,"
	它就会说"你看到一个物体  但那不是实物"
	it just says, "You see an object, but it isn't real."
	-你碰得到吗  -不行  这上面说
	- Okay, can you touch it? - Hmm, no, it says,
	"你把手伸入光束中  但却抓不到"
	"You put your hand into the light, but cannot grasp it."
	-而且没法出去  -你好好想想
	- And there's no way out. - Okay, well, think about it.
	如果你能把手伸入全息图里  那说明了什么
	If you can put your hand in the hologram, what does that mean?
	你得思考一下
	I mean, you have to think about
	那个房间的物理空间结构
	the physical space of the room, you know?
	记住  那些安卓男巫
	And remember, the Android sorcerer
	阴险狡诈  诡计多端
	is brilliant and cunning.
	-伙计们  -弗洛斯蒂  别再拆螺丝了
	- Guys! - Hey, Frosty, don't strip any more screws, okay?
	我得把它们旋紧  旋得非常紧
	Gotta-- gotta make 'em tight, real tight.
	上帝啊  我们必须得重新布线
	Oh, my God, we have got to rewire this.
	造机柜都来不及
	We can't build the cabinets fast enough.
	还说什么布线啊
	Wiring's an afterthought.
	-上帝啊  -等等
	- Oh, boy. - Wait just a darn minute.
	我是可以穿过全息图吗
	Can I walk through the hologram?
	-也许哦  -妈妈咪呀
	- Maybe. - Holy cow!
	想出这个主意的人简直是天才
	Whoever came up with that is brilliant.
	谢谢  是我想出来的
	Thank you. I came up with that.
	-你是视差的开发者  -网络问题
	- You're the creator of "Parallax"? - Network problem.
	-严重延时  -好事啊  说明我们很受欢迎
	- Serious lag. - That's good, we're popular.
	不  我不知道服务器主机能不能承受得住压力
	No, I don't know that the server host can handle the strain
	连调制解调器组都不一定承受得住这种负载
	or even if the modem bank can stay up with the load.
	-去他妈的双陆棋  -谢谢
	- Then screw backgammon! - Thank you.
	怎么回事
	What is going on here?
	你们几个给我住手
	You guys, cut it out.
	视差老是崩溃
	"Parallax" keeps crashing
	就是因为他那版本的双陆棋太大了
	because his version of backgammon is too big.
	-怎么可能  -有多大
	- No frickin' way! - Well, how big is it?
	超过500K
	Over 500k.
	为什么一个双陆棋要花上半兆
	Why does backgammon have to be half a meg?
	不就是个有圆形棋子  三角形图案的方形棋盘吗
	It's a square with some circles and some triangles.
	-可能是因为颜色  -有颜色挺好的
	- It could be all the colors. - Color is good.
	拜托  我们做的是靠电话线传输的网络游戏
	Hello, our games have to run on phone lines,
	不是有塑料盒装内存的游戏机
	not on a plastic cartridge with a crap ton of memory.
	是啊  所以这游戏才这么烂
	Yeah, and that's why they keep sucking.
	这游戏不烂
	Look, nothing sucks, okay?
	视差老是崩溃
	"Parallax" crashes all the time.
	因为你装了一个巨大的双陆棋
	Because you installed a big-ass version of backgammon.
	听着  我们的问题不可能
	Okay, look, backgammon cannot be the only reason
	只出在双陆棋上  但在我们查清楚之前
	that we're having problems, but until we figure it out,
	悠悠球  把它重新编成灰度模式的吧
	Yo-yo, just recode it and make it grayscale, okay?
	什么  不行
	What? No way!
	怎么回事
	What was that about?
	我觉得我们得停机
	I think we should unplug the cabinets.
	想个更好的电源方案
	Figure out a better power solution.
	或许小心地把线重接一遍能改善延迟状况
	Maybe rewiring everything more carefully will help with the lag.
	你是说暂停网络服务吗
	You mean take the network offline?
	-对  停几小时  -我们不能那样做
	- Yeah, for a couple hours. - We can't do that.
	我们已经因为运行中断收到很多投诉了
	We're already getting complaints about the outages.
	如果我们不找出故障原因  只会变得更慢
	It's only gonna get slower if we don't figure out what's wrong.
	唐娜  不行
	Donna, no.
	你要玩什么
	Whatcha playing?
	有彩色的大游戏
	Another fat-ass game with color.
	我们烧了个断路器  是不是
	We blew a breaker, didn't we?
	我们不仅烧了断路器
	We didn't blow the breaker.
	好像整个街区都停电了
	I think we blew the whole block.
	我这就去看

	Amazing! Hey, guys, wait up.
	-准备好了吗  -嗯
	- Ready to do it? - Yeah.
	-唐娜  -副驾
	- Donna? - Shotgun!
	-想一起去吗  -什么  不
	- Do you want to go with them? - What? No.
	不行  我得处理好这事
	No, I have to take care of this anyway.
	你想去的话  不必等他们来问你
	If you want to go, you don't have to wait for them to ask.
	跟着去就行了
	You can just go.
	是吗  那谁来应付电力公司
	Oh, yeah? Then who's gonna deal with the power company?
	不知道  让他们寄账单来  会处理好的
	I don't know. Let them send a bill. It'll take care of itself.
	好办法  你这个体系真好
	That's great. That's a really amazing system you've discovered.
	-有问题吗  -是的  卡梅伦  有问题
	- Do you have a problem? - Yeah, cameron, I do.
	你说这里没有老板
	You made this a place without a boss,
	虽然听上去很不错  但这样一来
	and that sounds really nice, but what that translates into
	只会造成一堆麻烦没人管
	is a bunch of crap falling through the cracks
	最后还得我来收拾
	that I end up having to deal with.
	天啊  既然你这么在行
	God, well, if you're so good at dealing with it,
	那就继续充当
	then why don't you just keep being
	我们都离不开的救世主好了
	the savior we all supposedly need so much?
	因为我不想当这里的家长
	Because I don't want to be the mom here.
	我在家已经是家长了
	Look, I do that at home.
	我来这儿是为了做我热爱的工作
	I came here to do what I love,
	-但我并不喜欢应付电力公司  -唐娜
	- and I don't love dealing with the power company. - Donna.
	我不喜欢管支票簿
	And I don't love managing the checkbook
	好保证我们不透支
	to make sure we don't overdraw
	我也不喜欢给一群程序员做奶妈
	and I don't love playing wet nurse to a bunch of coders
	他们简直像幼儿园小孩...
	who act more like kindergarteners--
	那就别做啊  没人要你去做
	Then don't do those things! Nobody asked you to!
	-天啊  -该死
	- Jesus. - Damn it.
	我已经尽力维持了  但内森...
	I did everything I could to keep things going, but Nathan--
	内森想卖掉
	Nathan wanted to sell.
	我拼命想保住大家的饭碗的  真的
	You know, I fought for everyone's jobs, I really did.
	你不必为从出售中得到很多钱而道歉
	You don't have to apologize for making out like a bandit in the sale.
	天啊
	Oh, god.
	如果我是你也会这么做
	Man, I'd have done the same thing if I were in your shoes.
	你接管之前  我还在升级系统软件包呢
	Before you took over, I was updating systems software packages.
	你来了之后
	After you,
	我们在两年内从零搭建了两台机器
	we built two machines in two years from the ground up.
	专业版就是巨人加点东西
	The pro was just a Giant with a bag on the side of it.
	专业版很棒  巨人很棒
	The pro was amazing. Giant was amazing.
	如果不是你
	I would never have gotten
	我根本没有机会参与其中
	the opportunity to do any of it if it weren't for you.
	还记得有天晚上  你找不到音乐来源吗
	Gosh, you remember that one night when you couldn't find the music?
	-什么  -记得吗
	- What? - Remember?
	当时我们调试专业版都三周了
	We were three weeks deep on debugging the pro.
	那天大概是凌晨4点吧  我们在"杀戮室"
	It was maybe 4:00 am. We're in the Kill Room.
	你无法专心工作  因为你认定
	You couldn't focus because you were convinced
	有人在停车场公放《梦想编织者》
	somebody was cranking "Dream Weaver" in the parking lot.
	-于是你出去看  -什么
	- So you go out to check-- - What?
	是啊  你出去看了
	Yeah, you go outside, you check,
	然后你又回来  拆掉一块天花板
	You come back in, you take a ceiling tile out,
	爬到天花板上
	and you climb up into the ceiling.
	记得吗  想一想  很逗的
	Remember? Come on, it was amazing.
	是啊
	Yeah.
	嗯  我...
	Yeah, I...
	大概是吧
	Sort of.
	是什么时候的事
	When was this?
	我记得是你
	I mean, I think it was you.
	我们当时为赶工嗑了那么多可卡因
	Jesus, we were all so coked out of our minds trying to hit those deadlines.
	谁知道呢
	Who knows?
	知道吗  唐娜  我觉得这挺不错
	You know, Donna, I'm feeling really good about it.
	这真是这一篇章最好的结局
	I mean, this really is the best way that this chapter could've ended.
	-能给我...  -给  加了奶油  两块糖
	- Can I have-- - Here, cream, two sugars.
	-谢谢  -现在我有时间了
	- Oh, thank you. - Now I got time.
	时间真是重要的宝贵资源
	And time is such a valuable, precious resource.
	-而现在我有大把时间  -是啊  真好
	- And now I got boatloads of it, you know? - Yeah, that's great.
	我可以开始搞投资  并且...
	I can start this investment thing and--

	- Oh, my keys? - Couch.
	-看看灯旁边的靠枕底下  -谢谢
	- Try the cushion by the lamp. - Thank you.
	但我要先把钱花在孩子们身上
	But you know what I'm gonna spend it on first is our kids.
	我知道这话我说了很久了
	And I know I've been saying that for a long time,
	但这次我是认真的
	But this time I really mean it.
	你知道
	I mean, did you know that
	琼妮能唱整首《你好裘德》吗
	Joanie can sing all the lyrics to "Hey, Jude"?
	那多棒啊
	I mean, I'm sorry, isn't that incredible?
	-等等  女儿们呢  -简直不可思议...
	- Wait, where are the girls? - It's absolutely phenom--
	-穿好衣服了  在车里呢  -那就好
	- They're dressed an in the car. - Oh, good.
	-天呐  -怎么了
	- Oh, my god. - What?
	卡迪夫关门  戈登  是今天
	The closing-- Gordon, it's today.
	-我完全忘了  -没事  没事
	- I completely forgot. - It's okay, it's okay.
	我就打算过去  然后签字
	Look, I'm just gonna go in. I'm gonna sign my name.
	-不是什么大事  -还能拿到一大笔钱
	- It's not a big deal. - And collect an incredible amount of money.
	你真的做到了  你付出那么多努力
	You really did it. You worked so hard.
	-我真为你骄傲  -嗯
	- I'm really proud of you. - Yeah.
	看啊  他们这轮坦克大战15分钟前就结束了
	Look at this. Their "Tank battle" round timed out 15 minutes ago
	可他们还在用对话框说话
	and they're still talking to each other in the chatbox.
	还有用户聊得更久呢
	Well, I've seen users do it longer.
	他们一小时付5块钱
	They're paying five bucks an hour
	就在这儿聊春假要做什么吗
	just so they can talk about what they're doing over spring break?
	我要去见卖XT的人
	Hey, I'm gonna go meet my XT guy.
	-你能行吧  -嗯
	- You good? - Yeah, I'm fine.
	好
	Good.
	当然了
	Of course.
	你还来取你的分成
	Of course you'd show up for your piece of the pie.
	受不了
	Unbelievable.
	为保证效率  我要念股东的名字
	To keep this efficient, I'll be calling out shareholders,
	从最大的开始
	starting with the largest first.
	听到自己名字  就请进入会议室
	Once you hear your name, please enter the conference room,
	签署我们给你准备好的文件
	sign the documents we've laid out for you,
	然后就能拿到支票
	and you'll receive your checks.
	罗纳德  弗兰克  还有加勒特·卡迪夫

	香格里拉怎么样
	How was Shangri-la?
	很好  很健康
	It's good. Healthy.
	桑宁代尔控股有限公司代表
	Representatives of Sunningdale Holdings, limited.
	内森这么早就卖公司是个错误
	Nathan's making a mistake selling off so soon.
	公司至少比这个估价高20%
	Company's worth at least 20% more than this valuation.
	我觉得烧掉一车
	Well, I think it was a mistake
	我们公司的电脑
	to burn a truck full of our computers
	然后跑去森林里也是错误呢
	and then go running off into the woods.
	好多的错误啊
	A lot of mistakes.
	是啊  很多
	A lot, yeah.
	很多错误
	A lot of mistakes.
	尼古拉斯·蒙迪地产
	The estate of Nicholas Mundy.
	说实话  我很高兴这都结束了
	You know, honestly, I'm just glad it's over.
	去年真是太折磨了
	I mean, last year was a grind.
	跟以前完全不一样
	I mean, nothing like it was before.
	不过以前也并不好玩
	Although that wasn't much fun either.
	第二台机器完全是重复工作
	Second machine was a lateral move.
	没那么有创意
	Less inspired.
	新东家都不想要那些机器
	The new owners didn't even want the machines,
	他们只想要专利
	they just wanted the patents
	好搭建更好的东西
	so they could build something better.
	专业版也没那么糟
	The pro wasn't that bad.
	没那么糟
	Not that bad.
	应该把这话写在包装上
	We should've put that on the box.
	戈登·克拉克
	Gordon Clark?

	乔·麦克米伦
	Joe MacMillan.
	请坐
	Just sit there.
	在第三页签字
	And just sign on page three.
	这是你的分成  减去你烧掉的第一批货
	This is your cut minus the first shipment that you burned.
	你什么都别想得到
	You get nothing.
	一分没有
	Not one red cent.
	你要是想  就去告我吧
	Now, you go ahead and you sue my ass if you want to
	我是十分乐意
	because I'd love nothing better
	跟陪审团解释你都干了什么好事
	than to tell a jury what you did here.
	你毁了别人的生活
	You destroy lives.
	你让数十名老实正直的好人失去饭碗
	You cost dozens of good, honest people their jobs.
	你害我的销售部高级副总裁
	You sent my SVP of sales,
	我朋友约翰·博斯沃思进了监狱
	my friend John Bosworth, to prison,
	为了什么
	and for what?
	显示屏花哨  却百无一用的电脑
	A doorstop of a computer with a fancy screen
	毫无历史价值
	and no legacy.
	有些人说这次出售很成功
	Some folks say this sale's a success.
	我父亲大概会说
	I think my father would've called it
	这就是阉割公牛
	cutting the nuts off of a bull and turning it into a steer.
	你现在退出市场也好
	It's good you're getting out now.
	什么
	What?
	巨变要到来了
	Something's coming.
	势不可挡  而且不会带上这里
	It's gonna be big and it won't include this place.
	更不会带上你
	And it certainly won't include you.
	你个自以为是的混蛋
	You entitled little bastard.
	你要是乐意
	You just keep going on
	就继续相信自己的鬼话吧
	believing your own bullshit if you need to,
	但你永远都是那个自私
	but you're always gonna be the same selfish
	混蛋的骗子  只想捞一把
	son-of-a-bitch rustler trying to get his.
	你保重  内森
	You stay healthy, Nathan.
	话说
	So...
	你打算怎么用你的分成
	what are you gonna do with your share?
	不知道
	I don't know.
	你呢
	You?
	我大概会回车库去
	I think I'm probably gonna head back into the garage, you know?
	干点实事
	Get my hands dirty.
	好啊
	Good for you.
	你是个建造者  你就该搭建点什么
	You're a builder. That's what you should do.
	多谢你的信了
	Thanks for the letter.
	你说我想来就可以来的
	You said that I didn't have to wait to be asked.
	莱夫告诉我你在哪的
	Lev told me where you were.
	他总是迟到
	He's always late.
	我就是...
	Oh, I was just--
	我本该跟戈登去吃饭庆祝的
	I was supposed to go to dinner with Gordon to celebrate.
	什么事
	What?
	他在卡迪夫的最后一天了
	Oh, it's his last day at Cardiff.
	真想看那里被拆掉
	Love to see a wrecking ball swing through that place.
	来了
	Oh, here we go.
	你怎么认识这人的
	How do you know this guy again?
	他玩视差  卖二手设备
	You know, he plays "Parallax," sells secondhand equipment.
	好吧  他是黑市贩子
	Fine, he's a fence.
	二位美女
	Mamacitas.
	东西带来了
	The gear is here.
	我能看看吗
	Do you mind if I...?
	你说要XT  我就弄到了
	You said XTs, I got XTs.
	嗯
	Yeah.
	这位大妈怎么回事
	What's with Mrs. Garrett?
	-你说什么  -她挺好的
	- Excuse me? - She's cool.
	都已经挺旧的了
	They're both pretty banged up.
	这台显示卡都没了
	I mean, this one doesn't have either of its video cards.
	但我们还有余的呢  是吧
	Yeah, but we have more, right?
	这东西又不难找
	Yeah. They're not hard to find.
	我只是说价格该便宜点
	I'm just saying that the price should come down a little.
	这是零售  不是批发
	This is retail, not wholesale.
	这东西还是偷的呢
	Oh, well, technically they're stolen.
	唐娜  你怎么回事啊
	Donna, what is wrong with you?
	要不要XT了
	You want the XTs or not?
	我可以插电看看吗
	Do you mind if I plug these in?
	我带了逆变器
	I brought a power inverter.
	不可以
	Yeah, I do mind.
	好吧  我们要了
	Yeah, okay, we'll take them.
	三千
	Three grand.
	五百
	这东西销售价是7500呢
	These things list for 7,500 each.
	我们又没去商店买
	Yeah, we're not paying list.
	你俩挺大胆啊  就俩女人单独出来
	That's pretty ballsy, the two of you out here alone.
	是啊
	Yeah.
	好吧
	Okay.
	给
	Here you go.
	二位回头再找我啊
	You ladies look me up post-Armageddon.
	尤其是你  大妈
	Especially you, Mrs. Garrett.
	听上去是好用的
	Well, it sounds functional.
	搞什么
	What the hell?
	等等  给我手电
	Hang on. Flashlight.
	是仿造品
	It's a counterfeit.
	那能用吗
	Can we still use them?
	你会用中文编码吗
	Can you code in Chinese?
	他骗了我们
	He ripped us off.
	好吧
	Okay.
	妈妈不来了  是吗
	Mommy isn't coming, is she?
	嗯  妈妈又得加班了
	No, mommy's got to work late again.
	我们还是可以去庆祝的啊
	Hey, we could still go celebrate.
	你们晚餐想吃冰淇淋吗
	Y'all wanna go get some ice cream for dinner?
	想去布拉姆冰淇淋店吗
	Y'all wanna go to Braum's?
	-好啊  -想吃什么都行
	- Yeah! - Whatever you want?
	-好啊  -好  我们走
	- Yes! Yes! - Yeah, all right! Let's go.
	我们去吃香草冰淇淋
	We'll get some vanilla ice cream,
	加软糖香蕉
	hot fudge, and bananas.
	好棒
	Yes!
	爸爸  我们现在有钱了吗
	Daddy, are we rich now?
	我不知道该怎么回答你  亲爱的
	I'm not quite sure how to answer that question, sweetheart.
	我们是百万富翁了吗
	Well, are we millionaires?
	接下来四五年如果投资得当
	With some smart investments in the next four or five years,
	嗯  有可能的
	yeah, we certainly could be.
	我们可以买大象吗
	Can we buy an elephant?
	或许吧
	Maybe.
	理论上是可以的
	I mean, theoretically.
	那能吗
	So, can we?
	你不能只买一只大象
	Well, you never wanna get just one elephant.
	大象是很敏感的动物  如果只买一只
	Elephants are sensitive creatures and if you just get one,
	它会觉得孤单的
	then it'll get lonely.
	所以至少得买两只
	You got to get at least two elephants.
	老实说  亲爱的
	And, frankly, sweetheart,
	我觉得咱家地方不够大
	I don't think we have the room.
	既然我们都有钱了
	If we're rich now,
	那妈妈怎么还工作到那么晚
	then why does mommy have to work so late?
	知道吗  问得有道理
	You know what? That's a good question.
	爸爸  你的鼻子
	Daddy, your nose.
	爸爸
	Daddy!
	老天  我没事
	Oh, my god. I'm okay.
	我没事  乖乖  我就回来
	I'm okay, girls. I'll be right back.
	天呐  我记得我第一次见你时
	Jesus, I remember the first time I met you,
	你就像狄乐百货产品名录上的商务女性
	just a perfect Dillard's catalogue businesswoman
	看什么都不顺眼
	with big judging eyes.
	我才没有
	Oh, I wasn't judging.
	我只是看戈登看惯了
	I'm just used to looking at Gordon.
	这混蛋在哪
	Oh, where is this asshole?
	-你不也一样吓人  -才没有
	- You're just as intimidating. - No.
	你就是的  你还以此为傲
	You know you are. You pride yourself on it.
	记得我们推出网络的时候吗
	You remember when we launched the network?
	花了四天时间才成功上线
	It took four days straight to get it live.
	就像搭谷仓一样困难
	It was like raising a barn.
	视差从菜单上启动不了
	And "Parallax" wouldn't boot from the menu.
	到一半的时候
	You know, halfway through,
	我们都以为是成不了了
	a bunch of us thought it was never gonna happen.
	我们完了  穆特尼还没开始就完蛋了
	We were done. Mutiny was over before it even started.
	但你不这么想  你没放弃
	But not you. You didn't give up.
	嗯  是挺不容易
	Yeah, well, it was intense.
	那么
	So...
	你觉得我该当老板
	You think I should be the boss.
	我觉得该有人当老板
	I think someone should be.
	我知道我们现在也挺好
	Look, I know we're doing fine,
	但现在就是大多数我们这样的公司倒闭的时候了
	but this point right now is when most companies like us go under.
	我们发展停滞了
	We're plateauing.
	我们得发展壮大起来  否则就没戏了
	We need to grow in a big way or we're not gonna make it.
	好吧  那是不行的
	Okay, well, we can't let that happen.
	我们急需很多重要必需品
	We're in dire need of some major essentials.
	我们需要更多用户  我们的订阅已经达到极限了
	We need more users. Our subscriptions have topped out.
	我们需要新游戏
	We need another game.
	我们都六个月没发布新东西了
	We haven't put anything out in, what, six months.
	我知道  唐娜  但我得等最佳的点子
	Yes, I know, Donna, but I need to wait for the right idea.
	而且我们得扩张网络
	And we need to expand the network
	光靠买偷来的XT已经不够了
	because buying stolen XTs isn't gonna cut it anymore.
	你说得对
	You're right.
	你说得都对
	You're-- yes, you're totally right.
	但是
	But here's the thing. I--
	我不想当家做主
	I'm not interested in being in charge.
	我想工作  做我喜欢做的
	I want to work, I want to do my thing.
	我不想做产品管理
	I'm not interested in product managing.
	我也一样
	Well, I'm not either.
	我注意到用户玩游戏时
	Look, I've been watching people chat on the network
	在线上聊天  有时候游戏打完还能聊几个小时
	while they're playing, sometimes even after for hours on end,
	我觉得完全可以借此
	and I think there's a real opportunity
	在游戏之外建立一个社区
	for a community to exist outside the games.
	如果你帮我一起管理
	So if you just help me with the managerial side,
	我就可以做做这方面
	then I can play around with that
	同时继续管理网络
	and still keep my hands in the guts of the network
	这样我就很开心了
	and I'm a happy camper.
	死混蛋
	Son of a bitch.
	混蛋
	Hey, dickhead.
	你卖给我们的电脑是仿造品
	Those computers you sold us were counterfeits.
	真遗憾
	Bummer.
	我们想要回我们的钱
	We want our money back.
	抱歉  女士们
	Sorry, ladies.
	不行  五百  掏出来
	Uh, no, 500 on the bar now.
	过来
	Come here.
	-乔  -好了
	- Joe! - Okay!
	好了  抱歉打扰你了
	Okay, okay, we're sorry we bothered you.
	再见
	Good-bye.
	好了
	Okay.
	我们的好运也该到头了
	Well, I think we pushed our luck about as far as it's gonna go.
	什么
	What?
	你怎么...
	How did you--?
	这混蛋有两台崭新的XT  还没开箱呢
	Hey, that little shit has two brand-new XTs back here in boxes.
	什么
	What?!
	别拿钱了  拿走装备
	Leave the money, just grab the gear.
	开车门
	Open the trunk!
	给我
	Give it to me.
	我抱住了
	Okay, I got it.
	小偷
	Scavengers!
	你还想要我的电话吗
	Hey, you still want my number?
	搞什么
	What the hell?
	你没事吧
	You all right?
	嗯
	Yep.
	你的鼻子怎么了
	What happened to your nose?
	过敏
	Allergies.
	你没赶上晚饭
	We missed you at dinner.
	是啊  真抱歉
	I know, I'm sorry.
	没事
	It's fine.
	等我下次卖公司我们再去吧
	We'll just go out next time I sell a company.
	-你喝醉了吗  -我没事
	- Are you drunk? - I'm fine.
	工作...工作上的事闹得很疯
	Work just went-- oh, I don't know. Work went insane.
	我给你留了一块布拉姆的山核桃派
	I got you a slice of Braum's pecan pie.
	放冰箱里了
	It's in the fridge.
	谢谢  我留着行吗
	Thanks. You mind if I just save it?
	我累死了  我要去睡了
	I'm exhausted. I'm gonna go crash.
	嗯
	Yeah, sure.
	唐娜
	Hey, Donna?
	怎么了
	Yeah?
	这挺好的吧
	This is good, right?
	卖掉卡迪夫  向前看
	Selling Cardiff, you know, moving on.
	挺好的吧
	Right?
	嗯  挺好的
	Yeah, it's very good.
	嗯  我就是...
	Yeah, I just...
	而且  这本来也由不得你
	And besides, it wasn't up to you.
	我都有点担心了
	I was getting worried.
	一切顺利吗
	Did everything go okay?
	昨晚晚餐时
	At dinner last night...
	你说我的那些话  是真心的吗
	Do you believe those things you said about me?
	当然了
	Of course I do.
	我是保留了些没说出来
	Yes, I left some details out.
	我没说你伤害到了很多人
	I didn't say that you hurt a lot of people
	也没说你是靠撒谎进了门
	or that you lied your way through the door,
	但那家公司的今天是你造就的
	but you made that company what it is today.
	我没拿到钱
	I didn't get the money.

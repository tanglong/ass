34
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,700
这是在保加利亚高山滑雪
Heli-skiing in Bulgaria.

35
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,840
我住的小屋里的床跟苏联监狱的床一样破
The chalet I stayed at had beds like a Soviet prison.

36
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,970
但是那雪
But the snow--

37
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,340
棒极了
oh, my God.

38
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,800
你的第一份工作就在石油业吗
Was your first job in oil?

39
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,810
当然不是
Hell, no.

40
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,800
我父母开了间小店卖地毯
My parents ran a carpet store.

41
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,650
直到二十多一直在那儿帮忙
Worked there into my 20s.

42
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,590
石油在我那时看来只是种脏东西
Oil was just a stain to me.

43
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,120
更何况他的主要企图
Well, not to mention that his main ambition

44
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,320
是下班后带姑娘过去
was bringing girls there after hours.

45
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,720
我哥哥竟然跟你讲这个
Remind me to kill my brother

46
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,690
记得提醒我干掉他
for ever telling you that story.

47
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,550
后来怎么改主意了
What derailed those big plans?

48
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,630
男人总有一日
Well, there comes a time

49
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,450
要独立打拼的
when a man's gotta strike out on his own.

50
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,300
商店烧毁了
Store burned down.

51
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,820
好吧  这也算原因之一
Okay, that, too.

52
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,620
我当时26岁  一无所长
So, at 26, unskilled,

53
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,720
进入社会开始打拼
I set out to eat the world for breakfast.

54
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,120
我找到的唯一一份工作
The only job I could find

55
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,360
就是处理
was managing the sludge

56
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,600
克利夫兰市郊一家橡胶厂的废料
from a rubber plant just outside of Cleveland.

57
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,470
我老板让我偷工减料
My boss had me cut some corners

58
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,710
结果把河烧着了
and the river caught fire.

59
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,600
凯霍加河
Cuyahoga River?

60
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,390
不用说  我被炒了鱿鱼
'Course I got fired anyway,

61
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,430
尽管我只是听老板吩咐做事
even though I just worked for the guy

62
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,590
而老板也是听上头的吩咐做事
who was working for the guy.

63
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,020
我要说的是
The point being--

64
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,780
自己做老板永远比替人做事好
It's always better to be the guy.

65
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,820
我总爱这么说  亲爱的
That's my usual joke, sweetheart,

66
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,600
但是为了不老调重弹
but just to show I can surprise you,

67
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,730
我要说的是  我们都得经历艰辛
the point being we all have to take our lumps

68
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,480
才能挣到大钱
before we come into our own.

69
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,290
这样的成功才更甜美
Makes getting there all the more sweet.

70
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,870
那么  你爱上我女儿了
So, you're in love with my daughter, huh?

71
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,760
爸
Dad.

72
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,630
怎么  你不想听答案吗
What, you don't want to know the answer?

73
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,740
他无可救药了
Okay, he's impossible.

74
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:29,600
别理他
Just ignore him.

75
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,430
有其父必有其女
And she's an apple from the tree.

76
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,780
好吧  我去跟格雷姆打个招呼
Okay, I'm gonna go say hello to Graham,

77
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,180
省得在这儿受他折磨
spare myself the torture.

78
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,300
让他干点活儿
Get him to do some work for a change.

79
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,690
他应该给我修吉普的
He's supposed to be fixing my Jeep.

80
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,580
我很爱你女儿
I love your daughter very much

81
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,450
因为她和你一样  不轻易相信别人
because, among other things, she's skeptical, like you.

82
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,210
你不介意我问一句吧
Then you won't mind me asking you

83
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,080
你打算怎么赚钱养她
how you intend to support her.

84
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,090
她不肯接受我的任何帮助
She won't accept any help from me,

85
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,960
至少在我活着的时候
at least not while I'm alive.

86
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,240
她靠写作赚的那点钱
And the money she makes from writing

87
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,650
可不够两个人花
is gonna be spread pretty thin for two.

88
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,360
不用担心
Don't worry,

89
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,330
我自有打算
I'm considering several options.

90
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,460
石油怎么样
What about oil?

91
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,600
石油都是在挖掘过去
Oil's all about digging in the past.

92
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,380
这我从来不感兴趣
I've never been that interested.

93
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,180
给世界提供动力还不足以吸引你吗
Powering the world isn't interesting enough for you?

94
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,700
未来石油供大于求
With a glut on the horizon,

95
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,640
创新改革必定缓慢
innovation's bound to be slow.

96
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,390
如果我是你
If I were you,

97
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,400
就会扩展业务范围
I would be looking to diversify.

98
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,570
做什么
Into what?

99
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,900
有前瞻性  有潜力改变世界的东西
Something forward-looking with the potential to change everything.

100
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,600
我依然认为  那是技术
For me, that's still tech

101
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,620
除非最后证明我错了
and will be until proven otherwise.

102
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,360
我是这样想的  乔
Here's what I think, Joe.

103
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,040
就凭你复杂多变的工作经历
I think with your checkered work history --

104
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,980
这已经是好听的说法了
and that's the nice way of putting all the things I've heard --

105
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,220
你现在并没有太多选择
you don't have a whole lot of options right now,

106
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,600
无论是在技术或者别的领域
in tech or anywhere else.

107
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,940
你拿不到好推荐
With your abysmal references,

108
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,770
你想去应聘华夫饼铛推销员都困难
I think you'd have a tough time getting a job selling waffle irons.

109
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,800
你真想让自己经受那些吗
You'd really want to put yourself through all that?

110
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,420
无论付出什么代价
Whatever it takes.

111
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,630
我只是在陈述冰冷的事实
I'm just stating cold facts.

112
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,900
你找工作不会轻松
You won't easily get a new job.

113
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,810
如果我说得不够清楚  我在向你提供工作
If I haven't made myself clear, I'm offering you one.

114
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,330
我不知道你认为我是什么人
I don't know who you think I am,

115
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,210
但我不是在寻求施舍
but I'm not looking for charity.

116
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,120
我也没有在施舍
And I'm not looking to give it.

117
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,210
今天  今天是梦想实验室日
Today -- today is dream lab day.

118
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,560
我要把它建立起来
I'm gonna really set 'er up, you know.

119
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,910
不废话  切实行动
No more talking, just action.

120
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,940
我甚至可能自学C语言
You know, I may even teach myself C.

121
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,470
谁说我只会做硬件了
Who says i'm only hardware?

122
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,720
在闲暇时间  我真的想学学做饭
Oh, in my spare time, i really want to learn to cook.

123
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,440
真正好好做饭
Like, you know, really cook,

124
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,630
为我们所有人
you know, for all for us.

125
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,640
今晚有什么特殊要求吗  亲爱的老婆
Any special requests tonight, dear wife?

126
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,840
香橙鸭
Duck à l'orange?

127
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,850
好啊  什么
Yeah, what?

128
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,470
你找到脆脆的...
Did you find the crunchy --

129
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,420
你还好吗
Hey, you okay?

130
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,230
嗯
Yeah.

131
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,130
还好吧
I mean, sort of.

132
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,170
我昨天去银行
I went to the bank yesterday

133
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,950
想提高穆特尼的信用额度
to try and increase Mutiny's credit limit.

134
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,750
柜员就只是嘲笑我
The guy there just laughed at me.

135
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,630
你需要多少
How much you need?

136
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,810
哈哈  你付不起的
Ha-ha, you couldn't afford it.

137
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,910
所以才需要风投啊
Well, that's what schmancy VCs are for.

138
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,170
如果我们能搞定他的话
Yeah, well, if we can close him.

139
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,380
没有长期数据
I'm afraid without longer term data --

140
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,720
他对我们的预计增幅恐怕不会信服
he'll balk at our projected growth.

141
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,730
你在德州仪器时业务陈述一向做得很棒
Look, you always killed your presentations at TI.

142
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,930
这也不会有什么不同
This is gonna be no different.

143
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,710
你只需要走进去
You just go in there,

144
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,840
自信地讲一个好故事
you tell a good story with confidence.

145
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,880
爸爸
Daddy!

146
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,690
叫这么急  还以为是房子着火了呢
Oh, you know, you'd think the house was on fire.

147
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,270
飞来啦  宝贝
Flying in, babe!

148
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,100
必须是重入式  递归的
It has to be re-entrant, recursive.

149
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,430
除了排序  选择或迭代
I mean, you never need to branch except to sequence,

150
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,240
不需要分支
select, or iterate.

151
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,040
-我不...  -我在改进图形界面
- I don't... - I'm trying to help the graphics.

152
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,100
什么  即使让网络崩溃吗
What, even if it makes the network crash?

153
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,560
按功能模块再做一次测试  今晚之前做好
Do another rev in blocks, and do it by tonight.

154
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,790
卡梅伦  可用了 
Cameron, it's up.

155
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:31,990
什么
What?

156
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,170
为什么这段代码没弄好
Why is this sequence not done?

157
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,800
卡梅伦  我们上线了
Cameron, we're live.

158
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,640
什么
What?

159
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,390
独立的即时消息  没有游戏
Stand-alone messaging, no game.

160
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,310
我们管它叫穆特尼社区
We're calling it Mutiny Community,

161
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,140
但也可以改成更时髦的名字
but we're open to something snappier.

162
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,320
你做这个花了多少时间
How many hours did this take you?

163
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,630
没多少
Not too many.

164
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,260
唐娜  我们聊过了
Donna, we talked about this.

165
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:52,870
你可以尝试这个
You can try this,

166
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,180
但是游戏的开发都跟不上了
but we're falling behind on games.

167
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,180
等等  等等  闭嘴  闭嘴
Wait, wait, shut up, shut up.

168
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,320
看  我们第一个用户
Look, our first user.

169
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,310
{\an7}这是什么游戏的

170
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,960
"没有游戏  只是聊天
"No game, just chat.

171
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,800
你好"
"Hi, how are you?"

172
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,080
{\an7}屠梦者79退出了房间

173
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,580
好吧  你能去把游戏代码写完吗
Okay, can you please go finish your game code now,

174
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,230
做咱们公司真正该做的事
like what we actually do at this company?

175
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,790
老天
Oh, God.

176
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,580
我没指望盛情欢迎
I didn't expect a ticker tape,

177
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,270
但至少给我把椅子啊
but I could use a chair.

178
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,990
老天
Oh, God.

179
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,890
天啊
Whoo, Jesus.

180
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,940
第一次监狱暴乱  两个脚踝都粉碎性骨折
The first prison riot, I broke both my ankles. I shattered them.

181
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,380
他们用防暴水枪冲我
They got me with the water cannon.

182
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,270
把我从两层的窄道上冲下来
They blasted me off a second-story catwalk.

183
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,570
摔在水泥地上
Right on the concrete.

184
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,800
你们有谁真信了吗
God dang, are you guys buying any of that?

185
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,280
天呐  你们是有什么毛病啊
Jesus, what's wrong with you?

186
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,980
你好吗  博斯沃思
How you doing, Bosworth?

187
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,990
阿基  来拜见传说
Arki, meet a legend.

188
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,140
嗯嗯  好吧
Yeah, sure, sure.

189
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,280
你什么时候出来的  博斯
When'd you get out, Boz?

190
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,290
我前两天挖隧道跑出来了
Well, I tunneled out a couple days ago, by God,

191
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,930
但我得找个地方先洗洗尘
but, uh, just had to find me a shower.

192
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,570
我准备好了
I'm ready to go.

193
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,230
来吧  开始派对吧
Come on, let's get the party started.

194
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,070
我坐哪里
Where do I sit?

195
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,450
等等  你要在这儿工作了
Wait, you're working here now?

196
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,500
-太棒了  -是的  刚成为17号员工
- Awesome! - Yes, sir. Just signed on as employee number 17.

197
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,710
-好棒  -你在监狱里学会打字没
- Dude. - Did you learn how to type while you were in prison?

198
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,150
你个小混蛋
You son of a bitch.

199
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,440
这里可以吗  我就坐那儿了
It's good here? I'll sit there, for God's sake.

200
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,470
之前流过鼻血吗
You have nosebleeds before?

201
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,040
小时候被恶霸欺负时流过  后来就没有了
No, not since Garrett Faloona used to punch me on the playground.

202
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,080
有其他症状吗  头痛  恶心
You have any other symptoms-- headache, nausea,

203
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,710
关节痛  任何症状
soreness of the joints, anything?

204
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,600
没有  没什么
No, no, not really.

205
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,950
我是说...
I mean, I, um...

206
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,030
我们搭建电脑赶工期时
back when we were chasing deadlines on this computer we were building,

207
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,160
我有段时间用过可卡因来提神
mm, I used cocaine for a brief spurt.

208
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,100
好吧
Okay.

209
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,340
多短期  用了多少
How brief and how much?

210
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,710
两三个月吧
Two, three months.

211
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,880
量不太清楚
And, I don't know,

212
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,230
需要时就用了
whenever we needed it.

213
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,350
我们时间真的很紧  所以...
We were under the gun, so...

214
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,790
可卡因是莨菪烷生物碱  会灼伤鼻粘膜
Cocaine is a tropane alkaloid that can burn your nasal membranes

215
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,980
如果你没有先发心脏病或中风而死的话
if you don't die from a heart attack or a stroke first.

216
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,780
我三个月前就戒掉了  我...
N-n-no, I stopped cold three months ago. I'm--

217
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,200
那很好  我可不希望你女儿失去父亲
Good. I'd hate to see your daughters grow up fatherless.

218
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,630
那太可悲了
That would be sad.

219
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,360
不用担心...
Well...

220
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,860
我不是那种容易上瘾的人
no, I'm not one of those people that gets addicted to stuff easily.

221
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,970
我能保证
I can promise you that.

222
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,220
你至少该跟我说一声
You could've at least told me.

223
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,950
怎么了  我们都受够了当老大
What? We're both sick of playing boss.

224
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,550
等他了解了情况
I mean, as soon as he gets up to speed,

225
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,120
就能帮我们解决很多事
he can take stuff off our plates.

226
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,820
-他管理了卡迪夫22年呢  -我知道
- He ran Cardiff for 22 years. - I know.

227
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,180
穆特尼不是卡迪夫
Mutiny is not Cardiff.

228
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,150
这公司的意义就在于此
That's the whole point.

229
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,600
-我知道  -卡梅伦  他是前科犯
- I know. - Cameron, he's an ex-convict,

230
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,450
绝不是最佳雇佣选择
which is not exactly the smartest hire

231
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,190
我们正想多拉点投资呢
when we're in the market for more funding.

232
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,800
我们现在资金如此不足
And when we're this strapped for cash,

233
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,350
你要把钱浪费在
you're gonna waste it on somebody

234
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,540
一个一点都不懂网络技术的人身上吗
that doesn't know a bitmap from a baud rate?

235
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,750
别这么做
Don't do this.

236
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,810
别因为愧疚或同情他
Don't threaten what we're building here

237
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,570
而威胁到我们辛苦建立的东西
out of guilt or feeling sorry for him.

238
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,750
唐娜  他留定了
Donna, he stays.

239
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,440
我们说好一起管理
We talked about being in this together.

240
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,720
也谈过沟通的重要性
We talked about communication being key.

241
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:41,140
这和之前讲的完全不一样
This... this isn't what we talked about.

242
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,900
怎么了
What?

243
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,510
我在想
I was just thinking about...

244
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,520
你爸要我去工作
your father offering me that job.

245
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,390
是啊
Yeah.

246
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,250
我还在生他的气呢
I mean, I'm still mad at him.

247
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,190
典型的雅各布·维勒式伏击
It's the classic Jacob Wheeler ambush.

248
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,200
假如我接受呢
What if I took it?

249
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,230
为什么啊
Well, why would you?

250
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,390
我们以前还打趣
I mean, we joked about that.

251
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,150
你管那地方叫坟场
You called that place a mausoleum,

252
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,960
"以化石为基础的买卖"
"A business literally built on fossils."

253
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,560
我知道  但是
I know, but, I don't know...

254
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,150
我查了很多资料
I've been doing a bunch of reading.

255
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,120
三维计算机建模正在撼动整个产业
3-D computer modeling is really shaking up the industry,

256
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,680
改变了钻井的方式和选地
changing where and how to drill.

257
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,240
我愿意参与进去
I could get into that,

258
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,080
帮着西方集团走向未来
help take Westgroup into the future.

259
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,860
那其他工作呢
What about those other jobs?

260
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,130
都没要我
Didn't pan out.

261
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,090
我知道也不该就因此去你爸的石油公司干活儿
I know, that's no reason to go work for your father's oil company,

262
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,530
但大致了解之后  莎拉
but I've kicked the tires on this, Sara,

263
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,910
我真的挺感兴趣
and I'm genuinely interested.

264
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,990
也可能只是不想再苦等了
Or maybe you're just tired of waiting.

265
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,170
抱歉
I'm sorry.

266
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,260
我很清楚过去一年赋闲在家
Look, I know that this past year being on the sidelines

267
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,110
你很不好受
has been really tough for you.

268
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,130
但你之前说在等别人来联系你
But when you said you were waiting for contact,

269
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,400
我没料到是想要我爸来找你
I didn't think you meant from my father.

270
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,630
如果你实在觉得怪
If this is too weird for you,

271
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,150
我可以再等别的
then I can wait around for something else to...

272
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,080
不会  不用
No, no.

273
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,180
我不想看你不开心
I don't want you to be unhappy.

274
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,990
那我们得搬到达拉斯去
And we'd have to move to Dallas.

275
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,510
这会让你不开心吗
Would that make you unhappy?

276
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,000
乔
Joe...

277
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,210
如果你想要这份工作
if you want the job,

278
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,980
这份工作  接受吧
this job, take it.

279
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,690
没问题  接受吧
Of course, take it.

280
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,450
C编程语言

281
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,760
{\pos(243.3,117.526)}{\an1}欢迎来到
穆特尼

282
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,760
{\pos(225.3,166.061)}{\an1}正在连接

283
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,000

- Stop! - "...revenue, our monthly burn rate is actually..."

284
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,570
小心
Watch out!

285
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,360
-抱歉  唐娜  -小伙子们
- Oh, Donna, I'm sorry. - Guys.

286
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,380
我瞄的是那个小杂种
I was aiming for that mongrel.

287
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,490
伙计们  到外面去玩
Guys, just take it outside.

288
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,230
别想跑  哪去了
Cube not okay. Where is it?

289
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,020
唐娜  你老公的电话
Donna, it's your husband.

290
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,240
戈登
Hi, Gordon.

291
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,400
听到没有
You hear that?

292
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,660
猜我在干吗
Guess what I'm doing.

293
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,260
用调制解调器
Um, using a modem?

294
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,600
没错  但怎么用的呢
Aha, but how?

295
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,340
会不会是我又买了一根电话线
Could it be that I got a second phone line

296
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,000
这样我们可以同时上网和打电话
so that we could go online and talk at the same time?

297
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,070
没错
Yeah, that's...

298
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,260
可能是这样
that's probably it.

299
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,530
跟风投的会面进展如何
How'd your VC meeting go?

300
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,510
安排在一小时后
Uh, it's in an hour, which is...

301
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,620
听着  戈登  我得挂了
Look, Gordon, I've gotta go.

302
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,390
要我帮你听听吗
Yeah, well, you wanna run your pitch by me?

303
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,770
或许我可以...帮点忙
Or maybe I could, uh, you know, help out and...

304
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:13,710
不好意思
Really, I'm sorry.

305
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,320
爱你  宝贝
I love you, darling.

306
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,100
回家见吧
I'll see you at home, okay?

307
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,160
{\an1}玩家名  胡子帅哥

308
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,870
{\an1}玩家名  胡子帅哥

309
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,220
好啊
All right.

310
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,880
你想来一局吗  小子
You wanna play, little man, huh?

311
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,290
什么  不
What? No!

312
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,910
你不可能先射击
There's no way you shot first.

313
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,720
我在游戏开始后100毫秒就开火了
I shot 100 milliseconds after the game started.

314
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,550
-你好  -斯坦  我是戈登
- Hello? - Stan, it's Gordo.

315
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,270
你现在在干什么呢
What are you doing right now?

316
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,990
太好了  我没迟到
Oh, good, I'm not late.

317
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,870
悠悠球被电压保护器绊倒了
Yo-Yo tripped over a surge protector,

318
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,770
让三台XT飞上了天
sent three XTs flying.

319
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,480
万幸的是  他们落在了一堆披萨盒上
Luckily, a stack of pizza boxes broke their fall.

320
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,100
被混乱所救
Saved by squalor.

321
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,920
-怎么了  -你换成这衣服了
- What? - You changed into that?

322
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,020
-没错  -我应该穿成那样吗
- Yeah, I-- - Was I supposed to dress like that?

323
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,970
那我该穿得休闲点吗
Well, was I supposed to dress down?

324
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,040
天哪  也许你是对的
Oh, God, maybe you're right.

325
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,620
也许他们就想要年轻叛逆型的
Maybe they want young and rebellious.

326
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,300
也或许你牛仔裤上有洞
Yeah, or maybe they don't invest a million bucks in you

327
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,810
他们就不会投一百万给你
if you've got holes in your jeans.

328
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:41,700
该死  我本可以...
Damn it, I could've--

329
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,580
打扰  豪伊小姐和克拉克女士
Excuse me, Miss Howe, Miss Clark?

330
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,390
邦汉姆先生现在可以见你们了
Mr. Bondham will see you now.

331
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,650
你们发行了国际象棋  西洋跳棋  双陆棋
Okay, so you have put up chess, checkers, backgammon,

332
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,870
坦克大战和视差
"Tank Battle," and "Parallax."

333
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,380
而且前三个不算  那几个根本没意思
And ignoring the first three because who cares about those,

334
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,520
15个月出了两款游戏
that's two games in 15 months.

335
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,930
你们貌似并不着急啊
Not exactly in a hurry, are we?

336
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,590
其实  视差有21关
Well, "Parallax" actually has 21 chapters,

337
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,120
每关的设定都不一样
each one with a totally different world.

338
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,780
-所以它不...  -嗯  我侄子原先很着迷
- So it's not-- - Yeah, my nephew got hooked on it.

339
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,730
-这就是我同意见面的原因  -很好
- That's why I took this meeting. - Cool.

340
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,640
但他在大概13关的时候就没兴趣了
But then he got bored around chapter, uh, 13

341
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,340
-那个大冰乌贼  -是螃蟹
- when the giant ice squids... - Crabs.

342
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,120
吃了爱斯基摩宫殿什么的
ate the Eskimo palace or whatever.

343
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,530
他说和别人联机打游戏很好玩
He said it's fun to play with other people,

344
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,690
但游戏本身就不行了
but the game itself-- you know, pfft.

345
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,050
和雅达利正在出的新品没法比
It's nowhere near as good as what Atari's been popping out.

346
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,680
我觉得如果你侄子对编程有更多了解
I think if your nephew understood coding a little better,

347
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,120
他会觉得视差还是很厉害的
he'd think "Parallax" was pretty cool.

348
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,550
卡带游戏也许现在看上去不错
Um, look, cartridge games may look better for a while,

349
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,050
但网游才是未来趋势
but online gaming is the future.

350
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,300
如果能持续盈利的话
Only if there's a profitable way to sustain it.

351
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,790
没错  这就是我们来这里的原因
That's exactly right. And that's why we're here.

352
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,090
我们的网络过载了
Our network is overloaded,

353
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,210
限制了我们新用户的订阅
limiting our ability to sign up new subscribers.

354
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,700
你怎么知道他们存在呢
How do you even know they're out there?

355
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,890
只有10%的美国人有电脑
Only 10% of Americans have computers.

356
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,130
其中只有15%的人有调制解调器
Only 15% of them have modems.

357
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,510
更别说你们还只用康懋达电脑
Not to mention the fact that you're only on Commodores.

358
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,290
你们怎能知道
I mean, how do you really know

359
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,340
存在足够多的用户
that there are enough users out there

360
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,540
能让我们赚的盆满钵满吗
to make us all a killing?

361
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,570
我们就是知道  靠店内咨询  口耳相传
We just do. I mean, in-store inquiries, word of mouth.

362
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,820
有很多数据可以证明
There's a whole world of data.

363
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,490
是嘛  有那种证据  我当然无话可说
Oh, yeah, with proof like that, how can I argue with you?

364
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,930
邦汉姆先生
Look, Mr. Bondham,

365
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,960
如果我们能筹到钱购买十台"彗星"小型计算机
if we had the capital to buy 10 11/750s--

366
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,690
-3.5万一台  二手机  -是3.2万
- 35 grand a pop, used. - 32-- 32,

367
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,550
外加维持本财年
plus additional funding to cover operations

368
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,510
运营的资金
through the end of the fiscal year,

369
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,520
-那我觉得  -那孩子呢
- then I think... - What about kids?

370
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,590
什么
Excuse me?

371
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,640
你们想要或者有小孩吗
Do you have or want kids?

372
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,760
-我没有  -我有两个
- No. - I have two.

373
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,430
这有什么关系呢
What does that have to do with it?

374
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,910
我要给一家公司注资
Well, when I invest in a company,

375
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,060
我不仅是在赌一个点子  还有人
I don't just bet on an idea, I bet on the people.

376
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,130
成功并不容易
Success is no Sunday drive.

377
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,760
也不是冰箱上贴着的待办事项
It's not another to-do tacked to the fridge.

378
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,720
如果你俩真像你们说的那样  要经营公司
If you two, as you claim, are really gonna run this business,

379
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,120
我需要知道你们会长期全身心投入进去
I need to know that you're fully committed, long-term.

380
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,790
甚至超过对孩子的投入
Even over, you know, biological imperatives.

381
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,280
抱歉  你到底给不给我们钱
Sorry, are you gonna give us the money or not?

382
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,120
乔·麦克米伦
Joe MacMillan?

383
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,720
是我  你好
Yeah, uh, hello.

384
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,540
尤金·鲍迪奇  欢迎来到数据录入部
Hey, Eugene Bowdich. Welcome to Data Entry.

385
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,550
我带你去你的办公桌
I'll show you to your desk.

386
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,610
我去了23楼做入职
I was on 23 for orientation

387
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,300
人力资源叫我来地下二层
and HR told me to come down to B2

388
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,760
我想这肯定是搞错了吧
and I think there's been a mistake.

389
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,070
没错啊  你的名字在我的板子上呢
Oh, no mistake. You're on my clipboard.

390
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,980
西方集团能源  你应该知道
Now, Westgroup Energy, if you're not aware,

391
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,020
是个拥有九家全资子公司的母公司
is really a parent corporation to nine wholly owned subsidiaries,

392
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,560
他们所有的数据录入都由我们负责
and we do DE for all of them.

393
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,210
颜色编码篮  充足标签
Color-coded baskets, redundantly labeled,

394
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,130
对应不同数据源
correspond to different inputs.

395
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,550
数字化公司记录的程序
The process of digitizing the company's records

396
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,130
从1974年就开始了
was begun in 1974,

397
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,650
不过当然  自那之后我们已经有了很大进步
though clearly since then we've made great strides.

398
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,560
雅各布知道这就是派给我的工作吗
Does Jacob know this is what I'm working on?

399
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,430
你是说雅各布·维勒吗
You mean Jacob Wheeler?

400
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,810
算了
Uh, never mind.

401
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,990
好  还有问题吗
All right, any questions?

402
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,280
那么  就是
So, it's-- it's just-- it's, uh...

403
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,650
人工操作吗
d-done by hand?

404
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,190
当然不是  我们使用的是光学字符辨识
Oh, no, we use optical character recognition,

405
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,130
只是需要人工校对
which-- which we correct by hand.

406
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,230
对于个别难以辨认的图像
For particularly naughty images,

407
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,090
你还可以用那个大家伙呢
you might even get to use the Big Kahuna over there.

408
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,170
但得先向我申请  好吗
But you'll have to ask me first, okay?

409
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,890
好吗
Okay?

410
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,750
-好的  -好
- Okay. - All right.

411
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,610
下班时请记得打卡
Please clock out at the end of your shift,

412
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,800
另外请保持卫生间整洁
and we labor to keep the bathrooms tidy.

413
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,120
相信这点你一定能做到
I trust you'll comply.

414
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,170
去死去死  你这头笨猪
Die, die, die, you disgusting pig dog!

415
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,680
吃我一炮
Eat it! Eat it!

416
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,850
天呐  戈登  你要把键盘按坏了
Jeez, Gordon, you're gonna break the keyboard.

417
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,630
看到吗  那里
You see? Right there.

418
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,670
应该是你死  不是我死
You should be dead, not me.

419
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:11,690
游戏像是有计时问题
It's like the timing's off or something.

420
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,220
来  再来一次
Here, come on, let's go again.

421
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,650
抽屉还有
There's more in the drawer.

422
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,960
不用了  谢谢
No, thanks.

423
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,520
我只是惊讶你居然还
I'm surprised you're still--

424
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,640
那不是只是帮我们完成
I mean, I thought it was just a goof

425
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,550
巨人专业版的消遣吗
when we were finishing the Giant Pro.

426
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,970
没错  斯坦  真是
It was, Stan, jeez.

427
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,410
我就是找到些剩下的
Look, I found some left over.

428
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,400
那你要我怎么办  直接扔了吗
What am I supposed to do, throw it away?

429
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,700
快点  继续玩
You know? Come on, let's just play.

430
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,350
等等  这次
Okay, wait-- hey, this time,

431
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,170
数到三  然后开火
okay, on three, fire your tank.

432
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,360
准备好了吗
Ready?

433
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,840
一  二  三
One, two, three.

434
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,920
该死  到底怎么回事啊
Damn it! What is going on here?

435
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,370
不对劲  你我都看到了是我先开火的
I mean, we-- something's going-- we both saw that I fired first.

436
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,680
这游戏绝对是
I mean, there's gotta be some sort of

437
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,570
有问题还是什么的
glitch or something in the--

438
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,430
我们先休息一下吧  喝瓶啤酒
Why don't we take a break? Maybe grab a beer?

439
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,700
不行  我得打给唐娜告诉她这事
No, I gotta call Donna and tell her about this.

440
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,850
这可是她们的旗舰游戏之一呀
I mean, this is one of their flagship games.

441
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,250
我笨了  电话线都占着呢
Duh, we're using both lines.

442
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,300
好吧  我直接过去一趟吧
Uh, well, I guess I'll just go over there.

443
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,760
-你开车行吗  -我当然可以开
- You okay to drive? - Yeah, of course I'm okay to drive.

444
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,580
该死  斯坦  你能帮我个忙吗
Oh, shit! Stan, will you help me out?

445
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,240
去学校帮我接下孩子行吗
Will you go pick up the girls from school?

446
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,220
-什么  不行  -为什么不行
- What? No. - What do you mean no?

447
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,050
我都快两年没见过她们了
I mean, I haven't seen 'em in, like, two years.

448
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,360
给你  看看
Well, here, look.

449
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,490
你能认出来的
You can figure it out.

450
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,920
给你  可以给她们买点零食什么的
Here, and feel free to buy 'em some snacks or something.

451
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,040
他捡肥皂了  他捡肥皂了
He touched the soap. He touched the soap.

452
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,000
真好笑  姑娘们  真好笑
Very clever, ladies. Very clever.

453
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,100
哥们  干得漂亮  看见他的表情了吗
Man, that was awesome. Did you see the look on his face?

454
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,070
-笑死我了  -太有趣了
- Yeah, perfect. - Priceless.

455
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,710
那可是火灾隐患
That's a fire hazard.

456
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,790
-唐娜在哪  -看看谁来了
- Hey, where's Donna? - Whoa, look who's here.

457
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,950
你不应该带着刚拿到的钱
Shouldn't you be in Tahiti or something

458
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,080
去塔希提那种地方吗
with all the money you just made?

459
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,810
坦克大战
Look, there's a major problem

460
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,470
有大问题  游戏不公平
with "Tank Battle." The game's not fair.

461
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,320
兄弟  我们现在有更头疼的事
Dude, we've got bigger headaches right now.

462
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,740
幸好卡梅伦不在
And it's a good thing Cameron isn't here.

463
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,220
是啊  我真走运
Oh, yeah, lucky me.

464
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,100
听着  有时我向对手开炮
Listen, there's times when I fire at my opponent

465
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,680
但游戏没有识别于是我就被打死了
and the game doesn't read it and I get killed.

466
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,800
会不会是因为你开炮晚了
Oh, wow, well, couldn't it be that you're just shooting second?

467
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,020
不是的  斯坦和我多次同时开炮
No, Stan and I fired at the same time over and over

468
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,210
即便是我先开炮  结果也是随机的
and even when I cheated, the results were random.

469
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,650
你们的系统从多个调制解调器读取输入  对吧
Your system's reading inputs from multiple modems, right?

470
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,630
-是啊  -那么在一局游戏中
- Duh. - So in a given game cycle,

471
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,360
令牌逐个检查  看谁的坦克开了火
the token checks them one at a time to see who fired their tank.

472
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,950
-这我们知道  -对吧
- We know this, man. - Okay?

473
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,570
如果你想说
And if you're saying

474
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,320
令牌检查到时
whoever's fire command

475
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,200
恰好已发出开火命令的人
happens to be  next in line when the token sweeps it

476
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,340
便被识别为击杀成功
is awarded the kill,

477
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,000
那你就说对了
then you're right.

478
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,050
恭喜你  但所有玩家都冒着同样的风险
Congratulations. But every user shares that hazard equally.

479
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:58,670
但结果并不显示谁先开炮  结果是随机的
But it doesn't reflect who shot first. I mean, it's random.

480
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:02,000
如果结果是随机的那玩游戏还有什么意义
What's the point of playing a game if the outcome is random?

481
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,480
没关系的  好吗
Look, it doesn't matter, okay?

482
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,950
我有办法
I got a fix for ya.

483
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,200
你不是搞硬件的吗
Aren't you just the hardware guy?

484
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,160
我还拥有伯克利大学计算机科学的学位
Well, I'm also degree-in-computer-science-from-Berkeley guy,

485
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,770
那也是唐娜的学校
where Donna went,

486
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,600
我的分数高得能让你们的老二蔫下去
with honors and top grades that'd make your penis shrivel,

487
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,120
所以如果你们能闭会儿嘴还能学到点东西
so maybe if you shut up for a second, you could learn something.

488
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,860
给每个调制解调器的输入信息加上时间戳
You time-stamp the input from each individual modem

489
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,370
令牌检查完一圈后也加上时间戳
and at the end of each complete token pass.

490
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,320
判定击杀前将它们按正确的时间顺序排列
You put them in the correct time sequence before you execute them.

491
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,940
这样一来  先开炮的人...
That way, whoever shot first... -

492
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,700
就赢了
...wins.

493
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,320
-厉害  -太聪明了
- That's solid. - That is not dumb.

494
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,660
我们应该  我们应该这么办
We should, uh-- we should do that.

495
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,740
兄弟们  找到唐娜
Um, g-guys, find Donna.

496
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,580
有人要绑架她的孩子
Someone tried to kidnap her kids.

497
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,510
该死  斯坦
Damn it, Stan.

498
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,840
让我接电话
Give me the phone.

499
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,860
我是戈登·克拉克
It's, uh, Gordon Clark here.

500
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,420
我知道了
Yeah, I see.

501
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,990
其实那是我朋友  我让他...
Actually, that was a friend of mine that I asked to--

502
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,840
是啊  我们应该先打个电话的
yeah, we're supposed to call first.

503
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,670
对不起给你们添麻烦了  霍金斯校长
Well, I'm-- I'm sorry for the trouble, Principal Hawkins.

504
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,450
不  不  不  我马上过去
Oh, no, no, no. I'll be right there.

505
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,320
连送一周披萨  只要不说出去
Pizza deliveries for a week if not a single word.

506
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,100
一个月  再加汽水
A month, plus soda.

507
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,450
我可以挨我妻子的臭骂  我只是不想而已
I can take heat from my wife, I'd just prefer not to.

508
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,400
-两个月  -一个月  行吗
- Two months. - Look, one month, okay?

509
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,960
成交  臭小子们
Deal, you little rats.

510
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,070
他们想要的不是未来或愿景
I mean, they don't want what's next or vision,

511
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,780
他们要男人
they want an Adam's apple.

512
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,290
至少我们的穿着无所谓
Well, at least what we wore didn't matter.

513
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,470
是啊  他们在搞恶作剧
There's been some prankin' going on, sure.

514
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,980
-卡梅伦  -什么事
- Cameron? - What?

515
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,270
来看看这个
You should see this.

516
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,870
大概一个小时前电力出问题了
They had a power fraz about an hour ago,

517
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,250
烧掉了一个连接器什么的
fried a connector or some such.

518
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,590
你还是去看看吧
You might want to go take a look at that.

519
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,560
-嗯  好  -嗯
- Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah.

520
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,450
跟我们的视差一模一样  但图像更好
It's exactly like our "Parallax," Except with better graphics.

521
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,280
我也发现了  你从哪找到这个的
I can see that. Where did you get this?

522
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,050
朋友的朋友从他朋友那儿拷贝的  免费
A friend of a friend copied it from his friend, free.

523
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:10,240
有个混蛋剽窃了视差  而且在免费传播
Some asshole ripped off "Parallax" And is just giving it away.

524
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,690
-他黑了我们的网络吗  -我不  让开
- He hacked into our network? - I don't-- look, here.

525
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,110
这是谁干的  我们知道吗
Who did this? Do we know?

526
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,310
某个家伙  没人认识他
Some dude. No one knows him,

527
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:20,000
但据说他在最后一个子程序代码的注释里签了名
but supposedly he signed it in the comments to his final subroutine.

528
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,030
汤姆·兰顿
Tom Rendon.

529
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,390
好  查查名单  看他是不是用户
Okay, check the list. See if he's a subscriber.

530
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,840
汤·兰顿  该死的
Rendon, T. Holy shit.

531
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,750
克莱兰顿路2123号  他居然在线
2123 Clarendon Street. He's even still logging on.

532
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,840
你是汤姆·兰顿吗
Hey, Tom Rendon?

533
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,420
-你们是谁  -你偷了我们的游戏
- Who are you? - Hey, we're the people whose game you stole.

534
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,740
穆特尼的人
Oh, Mutiny.

535
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,430
太酷了  我正希望
Very cool. I was kind of hoping

536
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,000
你们能发现呢  你们觉得怎么样
it would find its way to you guys. What'd you think?

537
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,280
-兰顿先生  -叫我汤姆
- Mr. Rendon-- - Tom.

538
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,040
兰顿先生  我们很感谢你过去
Mr. Rendon, we appreciate your business

539
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,020
十个月的支持  但你不能偷我们的游戏
for the last 10 months, but you can't just copy our game

540
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,440
还指望不被发现
and expect to get away with it.

541
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,230
我没有直接剽窃视差
Well, I didn't just copy "Parallax,"

542
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,080
而是改进了很多
I made it a whole lot better,

543
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,290
如果我想不被抓的话
and if I wanted to get away with it,

544
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,550
就不会署名了
I might've, you know, not s-- not signed it.

545
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,250
我要说的是你必须停止这种行为
My point is you have to stop

546
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,950
否则我们就不得不采取法律措施了
or we'll be forced to take legal action.

547
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,470
好吧  好吧
Oh, okay. All right.

548
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,790
我在市中心的查坦-沃特金斯律所IT部工作
Well, I run IT at Chatham & Watkins downtown,

549
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,000
所以我能帮你们找个好律师
so I can help you find a good lawyer.

550
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,100
你觉得我们在开玩笑吗
Oh, you think this is a joke?

551
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:39,340
你觉得两个姑娘不能告倒你吗
What, you think a couple of girls won't sue your ass into the ground?

552
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,300
不是
No.

553
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,600
你们不会告我  因为那样我就会生气
You won't sue me because then you're gonna make me mad

554
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,390
就不会告诉你们怎么改进游戏
and then I'm not gonna tell you how to make your game better.

555
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,480
-你们想进来喝两杯吗  -好了
- You guys wanna come in? We could have a couple beers. - Okay.

556
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,110
我可以把一切都说给你们听
I can lay everything out for you.

557
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,470
听着  你或许觉得你改进了游戏
Listen, you might think you made the game better,

558
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,450
但我们做的是线上游戏
but we do games online.

559
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,580
六种颜色和液体监测仪一样的图像效果
Yes, six colors, that fluid scan,

560
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,740
在康懋达上也许能行
it might work on a Commodore,

561
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,310
-但如果要用电话线传输...  -我懂
- but if you want to do it across phone-- - I get it! I get it.

562
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,410
我懂  你们不想用结构凌乱的代码
I get it. You don't want to use spaghetti code,

563
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,380
你们想要事倍功半
you want to make more with less.

564
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,100
这才是真正的艺术
That's the real art of it.

565
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,080
你们试过画面交换或抖色处理吗
Have you ever tried page flipping, dithering?

566
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,570
-没  我是编程新手  -配合反锯齿
- No, I'm new to coding. - Combined with anti-aliasing?

567
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:09,160
别全用C语言做  能节省内存
Don't do it all on C. You'll also cut back on memory.

568
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,520
如果你们想听指导  还是可以来喝两杯的
Beer offer still stands if you want that tutorial.

569
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,970
好吧  别再那么做了  好吗
Okay, look, just don't do it again, okay?

570
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,300
不然我们问题就大了
Or we're gonna have a serious problem.

571
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,410
遵命  女士  我错了
Yes, ma'ams. Mea culpa.

572
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,770
我特此取消订阅
I hereby cancel my subscription.

573
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,500
我都不想再吃这个了
Mm, I don't even want this anymore.

574
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,470
伙计们  挖到金矿了
Dudes, mother lode.

575
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,960
这是博斯寄给卡梅伦的
It's to Cameron from Boz.

576
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,740
我猜这一定是他在监狱里寄的最后一封信
Bet it's the last one he sent from jail.

577
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,560
-你要把它怎么办  -你觉得呢
- What are you gonna do with it? - What do you think?

578
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,310
博斯出去抽烟了
Boz went out for smokes.

579
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,820
等等  那样不会把信毁了吗
Wait, won't that ruin it?

580
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,220
我能修复
I can fix it.

581
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,630
13年来我都是这么看我姐妹的信的
Did it to my sisters for 13 years.

582
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:58,500
快点  快点
Come on, come on.

583
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,240
快点
Come on.

584
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,450
太棒了
Nice.

585
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,990
"亲爱的卡梅伦
"Dear Cameron..."

586
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,150
我简单写两句
...I'll keep this short

587
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:15,420
因为我知道  我希望不久后就能见到你
'cause I know or hope I'll see you soon.

588
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,510
约翰逊的情况还是那样
More of the same with Johnson.

589
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,370
我不说那些烦心事给你添堵了
I won't burden you again with that whole mess.

590
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,470
我只是在努力忘却这一切"
I'm just trying to put it behind me."

591
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,840
这时候很适合讲菊花笑话
Cue appropriate butt sex joke.

592
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,610
"我一直在想我妻子  卡梅伦
"I think about my wife, Cameron.

593
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,560
前妻  我还想到我儿子
Ex-wife, I mean. And I think about my sons,

594
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,660
不知等我出狱他们是否还会认得我
if they'll know me when I get out

595
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,840
是否还愿认我
and, God, if they'll want to.

596
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,940
这是最让我痛苦的
That's what hurts the most.

597
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,000
这是最戳我心的利刃"
That's the real knife to my heart."

598
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,970
-还是别闹了  -怎么了  多有意思
- Hey, uh, maybe we should stop. - Why? It's too good.

599
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,740
是啊  别闹了
Yeah, man, let's just forget it.

600
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,050
继续念
Go on.

601
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,580
念完了
Finish it.

602
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,490
继续
Go on.

603
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,450
"我做的事值得吗
"Was what I did worth it?

604
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,010
老实说  我觉得值得
Honestly, I think so.

605
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,190
我在上帝的眼中还是好人吗
Am I good in the eyes of God?

606
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,710
或许这很糟  但我并不在乎
Maybe this is terrible, but I don't really care.

607
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,590
说到底  是我的内心  而不是他更重要
It's me inside that matters, not Him, push come to shove.

608
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,930
抱歉跟你说这些话
Sorry to lay all this on you,

609
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,040
但我也只能跟你说说了
but you're all I got to talk to,

610
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,140
这黑洞之中的一抹亮光
the light in this dark hole.

611
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,110
博斯"
Boz."

612
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,260
你在干什么
What the hell are you doing?

613
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,800
我们就是在胡闹
We were just goofing off.

614
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:43,360
滚出去  回家
Get out of here. Go home.

615
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,050
我住这里
This is where I live.

616
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:48,090
那就滚远点  让我有一阵看不见你
Then go someplace I can't see you for a long time, okay?

617
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,770
我们合作真的很好
You know, we really work well together.

618
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,310
或许我们该再启动一个项目
Maybe we should start another project.

619
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,270
或许我可以出资
Maybe I could even fund it.

620
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,080
至少直到成型
At least till it gets off the ground.

621
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,330
-真的吗  -是啊  为什么不呢
- You'd do that? - Yeah, why not?

622
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,590
那就太好了
Man, that'd be sweet.

623
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,370
但我要去北加州了
But I'm headed up to good old NorCal.

624
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,910
加州吗
But-- California?

625
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,810
你已经拿到工作了吗
Do you have a job lined up?

626
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,360
没有  只是去碰运气
Nope, just rolling the dice.

627
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,540
被卡迪夫解雇那天我就订了机票
Booked my ticket the day I got my pink slip at Cardiff.

628
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,400
外面有很多厉害的人物啊  斯坦
A lot of big dogs out there, Stanny.

629
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,380
弱肉强食什么的
You know, eat or be eaten.

630
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,990
那挺好  正好我饿了
Yeah, well, good, 'cause I'm hungry.

631
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,030
其他人  小心了
Ruff, ruff, you other mutts.

632
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,450
你不需要搭档的  戈登
Ah, you don't need a partner, Gordo.

633
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,450
不管你设计出什么  肯定都很棒
I'm sure whatever you dream up will be incredible.

634
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,450
我们再玩一局吧
L-let's play another round.

635
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,130
他们现在应该已经重编码了
I'm sure they've got it recoded by now.

636
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,050
好了  数到三  这次别作弊了
All right, on three. No cheating this time.

637
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,150
各就位  预备
All right, line 'em up. Ready?

638
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,380
一  二  三
One, two, three.

639
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,800
为什么延时了
Why the lag?

640
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:15,660
好奇怪
That's weird.

641
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,120
低用户数量
Low user volume,

642
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,490
而且都用的专线
each on a dedicated line?

643
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,670
延迟应该几乎难以察觉
I mean, the delay should be imperceptible.

644
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,150
绝不会这么严重
Nothing near this bad.

645
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,430
这东西我可不会出钱买
I wouldn't pay for this crap.

646
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,040
那些白痴肯定给搞砸了
The idiots must've messed it up.

647
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,730
这下游戏更差了
Now the game sucks even more.

648
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,430
一  二  三
One, two, three.

649
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,570
怎么回事  新时间戳代码
I don't understand. The new time-stamp code

650
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,100
应该至多只会增加100多毫秒
should only take an extra 100 milliseconds, tops.

651
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,530
现在线上有多少用户
How many users we got online?

652
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,250
132个
132.

653
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,950
再看一遍  二逼
Uh, yeah, check again, dumbass.

654
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,910
我这边看是80个在线调制解调器
I'm showing 80 live modems.

655
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,210
等等  慢着
Wait a second, hold it.

656
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,510
这里有不是我们写的代码
There's code in here that we didn't write.

657
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:56,110
什么  怎么回事
What? What's going on?

658
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,820
有人黑入了坦克大战
Someone hacked into "Tank Battle."

659
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,280
写了让多个用户用一根电话线玩游戏的代码
They added bytes that let multiple users play on a single phone line.

660
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,110
这太厉害了
This is awesome.

661
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,560
就像一个孩子买了张电影票
Like a kid when he buys a movie ticket

662
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,190
然后又传给其他朋友
and then passes it back to his friends.

663
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,380
出现了多少这样的情况
How many hacks are there like this?

664
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:12,360
这里有根线上有12个用户
Here's one that's allowing 12 users on a single line.

665
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,370
12  等等  什么  这怎么回事
12-- wait, what? How did this happen?

666
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,280
你们的代码里有后门吗
Do you guys have back doors in your code?

667
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,860
-嗯  我们总...  -你们跟别人说了吗
- Yeah, we always use some-- - Did you tell anyone about them?

668
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,980
当然没有了
No, no, of course not.

669
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,760
好了  我们删除代码
Okay, look, look, just-- we'll delete the bytes.

670
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,860
不许一线多人  然后再考虑如何防护
No free rides. And then we'll talk about security.

671
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,000
等等
Wait, wait, hold on.

672
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,470
如果是用户在黑我们  我应该能追踪到
If the hacks are from a user, I think I can trace them.

673
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:44,990
你怎么做到的
How'd you do it?

674
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,940
-什么  -别装  告诉我
- What? - No, just tell me, okay?

675
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,420
你从我兜里偷了钱
You stole money out of my pocket

676
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,400
你让12个调制解调器共用一根电话线
by getting 12 modems to share a single phone line.

677
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,670
你理应告诉我你怎么做到的
You owe me how you did it.

678
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,050
我建了个专用交换机软件
I built a PBX in software,

679
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,280
我自己的用户交换机
my own private branch exchange.

680
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,290
12个根本不算什么
And 12 is nothing.

681
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,730
我在努力达到3倍的量
I'm working on three times that.

682
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,360
如果穆特尼变成那样
If Mutiny could do that,

683
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,350
单个用户的收费就会减这么多倍
it would make our overhead per user that many times smaller.

684
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,480
你心算的吗
You do that in your head?

685
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,300
你想知道我怎么想的吗
You want to know what I think?

686
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,580
别说太长
If it doesn't take too long

687
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,390
我不想把鸡烤糊了
'cause I really don't want to burn my chicken.

688
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:21,040
你很厉害  你可以随便黑任何人
You're good at this. I mean, you could be hacking into anyone.

689
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,720
但你没有
But are you?

690
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,730
计算机服务  通用电气信息交换网络
CompuServe? GEnie?

691
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,180
你没动他们
I don't think so.

692
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,570
我认为你只在
I mean, I think you're only

693
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,930
克隆我们的游戏  黑我们的网络
cloning our games and hacking our network.

694
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:35,220
所以你要么是成天恨我们
So either you spend all your time hating us

695
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,570
要么就是真心欣赏我们的工作
or you really love what we do.

696
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:41,070
-谁说这事那么耗时了  -我说
- Who says it takes that much time? - I do.

697
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,970
我查了上月
I checked our top-10 users

698
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,140
在线时长最长的10名用户
last month based on hours spent online.

699
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,580
你是第四
You were number four.

700
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:53,620
我可以为你建个专用交换机软件
I could set up a software PBX for you.

701
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,560
50个都没问题
Hell, I could set up 50.

702
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,950
你是在让我给你份工作吗
Are you asking for a job?

703
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,260
不  我喜欢我的工作
No, no. I like my job.

704
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,480
真的  拿钱不少  又不累
I do. It pays well, the hours are good.

705
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,320
我闲暇时间可以研究游戏
I work on games in my spare time.

706
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,520
好了  你剽窃了视差
Okay, just because you ripped off "Parallax"

707
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,130
不代表你就是游戏设计师了
does not make you a game designer.

708
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,210
还需要概念设计
There's still the actual concept,

709
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,610
原创发明
the original invention.

710
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,250
不是往别人创造的东西上
You know, not just sprinkling fairy dust

711
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,780
撒仙尘
on what somebody else has created.

712
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:19,920
既然我不想应聘工作  能别教训我吗
Since I don't want the job, can I not have the lecture as well?

713
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,260
如果你需要那个专用交换机打给我
Okay? Give me a call if you want that PBX.

714
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:24,990
好吧
Okay.

715
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,290
我今天找了三个律师
I talked to three different lawyers today.

716
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,690
他们说最不能做的
They said the worst thing we could do

717
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,230
就是自己去找兰顿
is go confront Rendon ourselves,

718
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,500
希望你没干什么蠢事
so I hope you didn't do anything stupid.

719
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,480
他入侵我们是为了吸引我们的注意
He's hacking us to get our attention.

720
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,110
我觉得他真的很厉害
And I think he's the real deal.

721
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,730
真不敢相信我会说这话
I can't believe I'm saying this,

722
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,200
但我觉得我们该雇佣他
but I think we should hire him.

723
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,110
他也有意  他给了我他的简历
He's interested. He gave me his resume,

724
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,050
但我想先跟你商量
but I wanted to talk to you first, so...

725
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,100
你已经雇了他  是吗
You already hired him, didn't you?

726
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:12,140
太好了  我整个下午都在计划法律策略
Great. I spent the entire afternoon planning our legal strategy.

727
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,990
真是不浪费资源啊
What an efficient use of resources.

728
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,230
你给他开了多少钱
What did you offer him?

729
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,000
2.5万
$25,000.

730
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,050
改成两万  他会接受的
Make it 20. He'll take it.

731
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,770
我打给了他工作的律所
I called the law office where he works.

732
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,750
我一说出他做了什么  他们就忙不迭地骂他
Once I told them what he was up to, they threw him under the bus.

733
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,550
他上两次绩效评估很差
His last two performance reviews have been awful.

734
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,480
他们本就打算开除他  他也知道
They were gonna fire him anyway and he knows it.

735
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:39,030
你如果想多给他钱  就把我的工资给他吧
And if you want to pay him more, you can give him my salary.

736
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,140
因为如果你总这么单方面做决定
Because if you keep making unilateral decisions like this,

737
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,790
我就不会留下了
I will not be sticking around, okay?

738
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,900
嗯  好
Yeah, okay.

739
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,470
谢谢
And thank you.

740
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,040
-喂  -你今天过得怎么样
- Hello? - Hey, how was your day?

741
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,750
不不不  你先说
Oh, no, no, no. You first.

742
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,770
今天在办公室过得如何啊  亲爱的
How was your day at the office, honey?

743
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,300
挺好的  我们在计算机化记录
Good, we're computerizing records,

744
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,910
把一切录入档案
getting everything archived.

745
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,750
还有呢
And?

746
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:21,110
有时候
And, well, sometimes

747
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,510
我还能使用微缩胶片机
I get to use the microfiche machine.

748
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,880
不可小瞧哦
Not to be sneezed at.

749
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,720
还需要人批准才行呢
You, uh, need approval.

750
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,270
好吧  这是我的错
All right, this is my fault.

751
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,360
得了  当然不是
Oh, come on. Of course it isn't.

752
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,730
他在为彼得惩罚你
Yeah, he's punishing you for Peter.

753
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,490
什么意思
What do you mean?

754
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:47,400
彼得  他骗了我父亲
Peter-- he hooked my father,

755
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,300
让他加入几桩交易
got him deep on a few deals.

756
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,260
一个在苏黎世  还有别的
One in Zurich and this other thing.

757
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:54,940
但全都是虚的  交易都是假的
But nothing ever materialized. The deals weren't real.

758
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,520
最后  我父亲损失了几百万
All told, my father lost a few million.

759
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,040
这都是我们离婚前不久发生的
And this all happened right before we got divorced.

760
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,840
我父亲因为我而没有提防
My father let his guard down because of me,

761
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,490
彼得也没还他钱
and Peter never paid him back a penny.

762
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,890
你怎么没跟我说过
How come you never told me that?

763
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,490
因为
Because I--

764
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,470
我为此责怪自己
I hate myself for it, you know?

765
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,810
我不希望你视我为受害者
I-- I didn't want you to see me as a victim

766
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,650
或是白痴
or an idiot.

767
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,540
但我这就给我父亲打电话
But, you know, I'm gonna-- I'm calling my father right now.

768
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,020
他无权这么对你
He has no right to do this to you.

769
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,270
不  莎拉  慢着
No, Sara, wait.

770
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,890
我一整天都为此闷闷不乐
I've been stewing about this all day.

771
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,240
我心想这肯定是有原因的
I thought there had to be some reason.

772
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,880
现在清楚了  你父亲在试探我
Well, now it's clear-- your dad is testing me.

773
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,720
他想看看我的斤两
He wants to take my measure.

774
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:44,330
就凭你刚刚跟我说的  如果你是我女儿
And after what you just told me, if you were my daughter,

775
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,240
我也会这么做
I would do the same thing.

776
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,960
但这太扯淡了  根本浪费时间
Yeah, but it's stupid. It's a waste.

777
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,090
我不会让你...
You know, I'm not gonna let you just--

778
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,750
我不会的  别担心
I won't, don't worry.

779
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:56,330
我是大人了  我也在吸取教训
I'm a big boy. I'm learning a lot.

780
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:00,950
我们让这事先缓缓
So we can just let this breathe a sec.

781
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,180
好吗
Yeah?

782
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:04,990
好
Okay.

783
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,340
还有件事
Uh, one more thing.

784
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,820
就凭我的工资
With what I'm getting paid,

785
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,870
别想在北公园租双卧公寓了
a two-bedroom in North Park's not gonna happen.

786
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,760
我不在乎
I don't care. I mean...

787
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,370
我们可以支帐篷啊
we could pitch a tent.

788
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,530
回家见
I'll see you at home.

789
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,900
我爱你
I love you.

790
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,860
我也爱你
Yeah, me, too.

791
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,050
要叫她们吗
Should I call 'em?

792
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,220
我很期待让你们尝尝这个
I'm really excited for you guys to taste this.

793
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,390
我在垃圾箱里看到外卖盒子了  戈登
I saw the takeout containers in the trash, Gordon.

794
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,210
就考你眼力呢
Just testing.

795
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,390
你喜欢索尔餐厅的焖菜  是吧
You like Sal's cacciatore, right?

796
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,820
至少你对坦克大战的痴迷有所成效
Hey, at least your obsession with "Tank Battle" paid off.

797
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,210
我的程序猿们说你去过
My coder monkeys said you came by,

798
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,300
还说你的时间戳补丁很天才
that your time-stamp fix was genius.

799
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,660
是啊
Oh, yeah, yeah.

800
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,570
我就是工作时休息了一下
I took a little break from work, so...

801
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,570
当然了  胡子帅哥
Oh, sure, you did, sexy beard.

802
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,060
我们的记录显示你在线9小时呢
Our log says you were online for nine hours.

803
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,850
我肯定是忘关了
Hmm, well, I must've left it on.

804
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,580
而且  那些笨蛋
Anyways, the way those nitwits

805
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,370
编的码让情况更糟了
coded it made the problem even worse.

806
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,330
他们给你看延迟问题了吗
Did they show you the delay?

807
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,960
嗯  但那是因为汤姆
Yeah, but that was because of Tom,

808
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,560
是个用户  黑了我们的系统
this user who hacked our system

809
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,630
他还剽窃了视差  结果卡梅伦还是雇了他
who Cameron wound up hiring after he ripped off "Parallax."

810
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,200
嗯  有道理
Sure, makes sense.

811
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,950
很高兴她还是个疯子
Good to know she's still insane.

812
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,590
据说  他有突破发现
Well, apparently, he had this breakthrough.

813
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,440
他搭建了一个专用交换机软件
It's a software PBX

814
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,800
最多可允许50名用户
that allows up to 50 users

815
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,570
用一根电话线玩
to play on a single phone line.

816
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,770
-那太厉害了  -是啊
- That would be huge. - Yeah.

817
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,760
我有点想回去找那个风投的混蛋
I'm tempted to go back to that VC jerk

818
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,540
看看他是否愿意改主意  但我做不到
and see if it'll change his mind, but I can't bring myself.

819
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,560
穆特尼有多少潜在用户
How many potential users are out there for Mutiny?

820
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,010
你这话跟他一样  戈登  这无从知道啊
Now you sound like him. Gordon, there's no way to know.

821
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,380
但这不是关键吗  这会影响
But isn't that critical? I mean, it'll affect your valuation

822
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,780
你下轮融资的评估
for the next round of financing.

823
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,580
是啊  但又不能预测未来
Yeah, but there's no crystal ball.

824
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,520
是啊  但是  唐娜  或许能呢
Yeah, no, but, Donna, maybe there is.

825
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,170
你需要现有用户网络的分布图
Look, you need a map of the existing network.

826
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,130
穆特尼随时能看到子设备
Mutiny only sees a subset at any given time,

827
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,220
但是
but what if--

828
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,500
如果所有可以登录的人  不管怎么登录
what if anyone who could log on, legitimately or not,

829
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,090
同时登录呢
did it at the same time?

830
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,030
那得有多少人啊
How many people would that be?

831
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,630
-戈登  -我这就得去研究了
- Gordon! - Look, I gotta get started on this.

832
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,570
自己吃吧
Eat without me!

833
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,650
你可以在这里工作  但不能住这里
You know, you can work here, but you cannot live here.

834
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,540
嗯
Yeah.

835
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,030
你的信对我很重要
Your letters meant a lot to me.

836
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,500
你寄的最后一封
The last one you sent,

837
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,910
你签的是凯瑟琳
you signed it Catherine.

838
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:53,530
卡梅伦是我爸的名字
Cameron was my dad's name.

839
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:57,580
他死后我就开始用他的名字
I started using it after he died.

840
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,780
我以前会往越南给他写信
And I used to write letters to him in Vietnam,

841
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,540
我肯定是手误了
so I must've written that by mistake.

842
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,800
听我说  博斯
Listen, Boz...

843
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,350
你不能随便把信放在这里
you can't just keep stuffing envelopes around here.

844
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,710
我们的账目一团乱
I mean, our books are a mess.

845
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:22,450
回收账款什么的
Accounts retrievable, that whole thing--

846
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,100
得了  你知道那叫"应收账款"
Oh, come on, you know it's "Receivable."

847
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,830
不不  我不知道
No, no, I don't know that.

848
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,580
这事我做不好
Look, I suck at this.

849
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:32,000
我们需要你看看  发挥总裁的魔力
We need you to take a look at it, work some CEO magic.

850
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,820
而且我们还需要人帮忙筹钱
Plus we need help raising money.

851
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:37,550
我们会给你安排办公室  给你个拐角...
I mean, we'll get you an office, we'll get you your own corner--

852
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,570
凯瑟琳
Catherine.

853
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,620
我就是需要点时间考虑清楚
I just need some time to work some stuff out.

854
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,750
理清思路
Get my head straight.

855
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,610
-博斯  -得了  你虽然聪明
- Boz. - Oh, come on, as smart as you are,

856
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:55,260
但我还是比你更了解自己
I think I know myself a little bit better than you do.

857
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:00,490
你能让我来这里工作真是好心
My God, it's beautiful, you lettin' me work here.

858
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,240
但是
But I--

859
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:13,940
我还没准备好呢
I'm just ready for it, not yet.

860
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,380
你需要多久
How long do you need?

861
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,600
老实说  我不知道
Honestly, I don't know.

862
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:38,230
维勒先生  这是刚送来给您的
Mr. Wheeler, this just came for you.

863
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,640
有留言吗
Was there a note?

864
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,320
是的  夹在里面的
Yes, sir. It was stuck inside.

865
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,770
-给我读读  卡罗琳  -好的
- Read it, Caroline, will you? - Of course.

866
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,180
就写了"多谢给我机会"
It just says, "Thank you for the opportunity."

867
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,150
没有签名  好像是华夫饼铛
It's not signed. I think it's a waffle iron.

868
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,850
我知道是谁送的
I know who it's from.

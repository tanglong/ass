	詹姆斯第一次在小联盟比赛上三振出局时
	"When James got his first strikeout in Little League,
	我去做销售了
	I was on a sales call.
	他高中毕业时
	When he graduated from high school,
	我去坦帕开会了

	我知道  有时候他会觉得
	I know there are times when it felt like
	爸爸就是早上摸摸他的头
	his father was nothing but a head rub in the morning
	晚上门口一闪而过的人影
	and a shadow in the door at night.
	但今晚不会
	But not this night.
	今晚不会
	Not tonight."
	我能看看吗  我想拿给丽莎看
	May I see it? I'd really like to show Lisa.
	我不知道妈妈怎么跟你说的
	Look, I don't know what Mom told you,
	但我不生你的气
	but I'm not angry at you.

	Why don't you come tomorrow?
	让一个释放犯坐在前排吗
	What, an ex-con in the front pew?
	你妈妈会炸的
	Oh, your mother'd combust, for God's sake.
	丽莎不会介意的

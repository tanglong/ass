你们知道为什么早上要先吃蔬菜吗
You know why vegetables are a better way to start your morning?

35
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,360
因为蔬菜富含纤维素  有助消化
Because they contain fiber, which helps with your digestion.

36
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,850
你们知道消化是什么吗
You know what that is?

37
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,880
我刚刚解过大手了  我能吃甜玉米麦片吗
I just did number two. Can I have Frosted Flakes?

38
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,560
还记得我们谈过要尝试新东西吗
Remember our little talk about trying new things?

39
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,350
37度  穿衣服准备上学
98.7. Get dressed for school.

40
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,440
妈妈  我还是不舒服
Mommy, I still don't feel well

41
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,210
可爸爸还是要逼我上学
and Daddy's making me go to school.

42
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,160
宝贝  妈妈现在可不能染上病
Sweetheart, Mommy really can't afford to get sick right now.

43
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,640
我来给你冲咖啡
Let me make you a pot of coffee.

44
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,920
多谢  但我得赶紧去办公室了
Oh, thanks, but I gotta get to the office.

45
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,040
你能试试我的额头吗
Could you feel my forehead?

46
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,310
我担心我可能染上琼妮的病了
I'm afraid I'm coming down with whatever Joanie has.

47
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,190
她已经好了
Had.

48
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,400
非常凉  和你一样酷
Cool as a cucumber, just like you.

49
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,870
行了  你知道我要迟到了
Come on, you know I'm late.

50
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,360
好  我明白了
All right, I get it.

51
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,360
戈登  我没不高兴  我真的要晚了
Gordon, I'm not mad. I really am late.

52
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,380
我知道  我可不想耽误你上班
No, I know. I don't want you to be late for work.

53
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,970
多谢您百忙之中抽空见我
Uh, thank you for squeezing me into your schedule.

54
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,110
不客气  正式上班前你随便讲
Happy to. You've got my ear until the day begins in earnest.

55
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,880
-你想说什么  -机会
- What's on your mind? - Opportunity.

56
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,740
我先打断你一下
Well, let me stop you there.

57
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,060
我这里可没有任何职缺
I don't have any job openings.

58
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,560
没有正好  我也不想调职
Well, that works out well because I don't want a job.

59
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,180
你眼皮底下埋着一座大金矿
You're sitting on a gold mine.

60
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,750
给我六个月  我就能把网络和计算机系统部
Give me six months, I'll turn Network and Computer Systems

61
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,850
转变成可以创收的部门
into an income-generating department.

62
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,620
那好  我洗耳恭听
Okay, I'll play.

63
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,820
我就在主机室旁边工作
I work right next to the mainframe sites.

64
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,380
这些机器每天都是全天候通电
They're powered on all day, every day.

65
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,480
晚上和周末  他们就干放在那里
On nights and weekends, they're just sitting there idle.

66
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,980
我们可以在下班时间
We lease our mainframe space

67
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,640
把我们的主机和网络设备
and our network during off hours

68
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,410
租赁给需要
to third-party businesses

69
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,780
更大更强的网络的第三方
who need a larger, more powerful network.

70
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,530
费用几乎为零  所得全是纯收益
Overhead is near zero. It's pure profit.

71
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,620
安全风险太大了
It's too big a security risk.

72
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,140
我们的主机上运行着不少敏感的业务
We have sensitive business transactions running on our mainframe.

73
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,380
是这样  你不明白主机是怎么工作的
Now, see, you don't understand how a mainframe works.

74
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,770
我们可以修改优先级设定
We can configure the privilege settings

75
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,560
严格控制这些用户的权限
to lock these users into a tightly controlled area.

76
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,740
可以想象成是一个隔离室
Think of it as a padded cell.

77
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,930
外部用户绝对无法接触到公司的内部信息
No outside user can access our company files.

78
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,320
而这只是开始
And that's just the beginning.

79
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,840
这个部门可以
This department would be

80
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,890
催生出一个大规模的项目
an incubator for a large-scale operation.

81
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,640
我们可以把这尊巨人
We can turn this juggernaut

82
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,890
转化成一个强大而先进的独立实体
into one massive, forward-thinking entity

83
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,850
到时  你就能和雅各布·维勒称兄道弟了
and you, you'll be on a first-name basis with Jacob Wheeler.

84
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,860
我们只需要敢于去想  敢下决心
All we have to do is imagine it, trust it,

85
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,380
敢于动手
and flip the switch.

86
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,590
如果你这么坚信这个主意对西方集团有好处
If you believe so much in this vision for Westgroup,

87
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,170
那何不和你准岳父说呢
why don't you share it with your future father-in-law?

88
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,120
我知道你是谁
Oh, I know who you are.

89
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,210
你不会真以为我随随便便
You didn't think I'd take a meeting

90
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,550
就会见一个数据中心的小职员吧
with some plebe from the data center, did you?

91
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,440
她第一次离婚之前我就在这里了
I was here before her first marriage blew up

92
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,590
等她跟你掰了  我还会在这里
and I'll be here after she's done with you, too.

93
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,700
-你准备好了吗  -好了
- You ready for this? - Yeah.

94
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,540
-你先讲话  然后我...  -我知道
- So do your thing and then I'll-- - Yeah, I got it.

95
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,290
我想感谢大家伙儿
Okay, so, I just wanted to thank everyone

96
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,900
最近这几天忙得死去活来
for busting their asses the last few days,

97
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,700
基本没捞着睡觉
pretty much without sleep.

98
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,550
大家都知道我们最近情况不乐观
It's no secret that we're struggling,

99
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,810
这并非是这里任何人的责任
through no fault of anyone here,

100
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,520
但我们目前运营艰难
to keep the lights on.

101
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,640
每一分钱都很重要
Every penny counts,

102
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,770
谢谢大家这么配合
so thank you, guys, for being such good sports.

103
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,130
我们并没结束  但确实已命悬一线
It's not game over, but we are on life support.

104
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,340
我们仅用三分之一的XT维持运转
We're operating with a third of our XTs

105
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,980
我们的用户纷纷取消订阅
and our subscribers keep cancelling.

106
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,110
看来在游戏玩家中没有忠诚可言
I don't know, I guess there's no honor among gamers.

107
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,630
所以我们...
So we're kind of...

108
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,960
我们现在入不敷出
Look, we're spending more than we're making,

109
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,090
这是个数学...
which is a mathematical...

110
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,660
我们几乎没钱了
We're almost out of money.

111
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,810
仅有的资金要用来维持运营
What little we have we need to cover operating costs,

112
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,110
也就是说
so what that means is that

113
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,490
我们现在付不起你们的工资了
we can't afford to pay your salaries right now.

114
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,680
但作为交换  如果你们不拿工资
But in exchange for you forgoing your salaries,

115
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,360
我们会给你们公司股份
we're offering you shares of the company,

116
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,760
长远来讲  价值其实更高
which will be worth a lot more in the long run.

117
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,150
-成功的话  -对
- In success. - Yes.

118
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,890
对  成功的话
Yes, in success.

119
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,450
这就是我们选择的事业
Look, this is what we all signed up for.

120
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,810
这就是在这种公司工作的风险
It's the risk of working at a company like this,

121
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,080
但别忘记  好处也多很多
but don't forget that the upside is also so much greater.

122
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,900
我觉得值得冒这个险
I think it's a risk worth taking,

123
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,560
但你们每个人都要自己做决定
but each of you need to decide that for yourself.

124
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,720
我加入
I'm in.

125
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,570
我也是
Me, too.

126
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:10,710
我也是
Yep.

127
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,530
加入
In.

128
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,150
我退出
I'm out.

129
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,960
别这样  哥们
C-come on, man.

130
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,430
这段经历很愉快
It's been a sweet ride.

131
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,080
有学生贷款  抱歉
Student loans, sorry.

132
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,370
我们可以谈谈吗
Hey, can we talk about this?

133
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,740
我不会为了网络游戏冒这种险
I'm not going to take that kind of risk on a bunch of online games.

134
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,100
祝你写卡带游戏愉快
Have fun writing cartridges.

135
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,890
那是你一直想做的
That's what you've always wanted to do,

136
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,660
我不过给了你个好借口
so I just gave you an easy excuse.

137
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,140
也许是我觉得那些股份不会值什么钱的
Or maybe I don't think the shares are gonna be worth anything.

138
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,250
连续两天了
Two days in a row.

139
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,860
怎么  你想回来工作吗
What, are you angling to come back to work?

140
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:04,170
工作  你可是一个子都不付
Work? You ain't paying anybody anything.

141
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,840
更像是做义工
More like volunteerin'.

142
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,150
不  我正好有事来这边
No, I had an errand to run this side of town.

143
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,480
就想给你们带点早餐玉米饼
Thought I'd bring you over some breakfast tacos

144
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,150
你们的惨象都快赶上战俘了
'cause y'all are starting to look like POWs around here.

145
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,130
然后我发现了你们的发票夹
And I noticed this file with your invoices in it and

146
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,050
以及一些可以缩减开支的地方
a couple places where you could cut some costs popped out at me.

147
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,840
如果你想听听我的建议的话
If you're interested in hearing my suggestions.

148
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:28,850
当然
Yeah.

149
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,450
够了  我要回去弄游戏了
That's it, I'm going back to games.

150
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,810
别啊  莱夫  你做得很好
Oh, no, Lev, you're doing great.

151
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,000
你可以搞定的  只有6个聊天室
You can handle this. It's just six rooms.

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,050
18个
18.

153
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,040
你真是没听我说话
You really do tune me out.

154
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,840
不会吧  怎么会这样
Come on, how did that happen?

155
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,970
你说如果有许多人在聊同一主题
You told me any time there's a lot of chatter on a subject

156
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,250
就为那些用户创建一个新聊天室
to create a new room for those users.

157
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,700
这真是难以置信  莱夫
This is really incredible, Lev.

158
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,810
我刚创建完一个新聊天室
I just finished creating a new room

159
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,260
现在有一群喂鸟器爱好者
and now a bunch of bird feeder enthusiasts

160
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,910
挤在猫奴聊天室里讨论把猫砂
have hijacked the Catty Cathys to discuss using cat litter

161
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,580
-放在喂鸟器底端  -让我看看
- in the bottom of bird feeders. - Let me see, let me see.

162
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,310
结果现在猫奴聊天室的用户很生气
So now the Catty Cathys are pissed off

163
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,980
因为他们不能继续聊去尿味的话题了
because they can't follow their urine odor removal thread,

164
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,010
这让我很恼火  因为我讨厌猫和这群话唠
which pisses me off because I hate cats and Chatty Cathys.

165
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,630
我们有用户进聊天室只为了发牢骚吗
We have users coming into our rooms just to complain?

166
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,260
我们有没有只为社区而注册的用户呢
Do we have people signing up just for Community?

167
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,160
需要我给你画个爱猫女士和游戏玩家的维恩图吗
Do you need me to draw you a Venn diagram of cat ladies and gamers?

168
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,160
{\pos(298,252)}利用图形的交合来表示
多个集合之间的逻辑关系

169
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,200
重叠区为零
Not a whole lot of overlap.

170
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,770
我们能问卡梅伦再要个社区管理员吗
Now can we please ask Cameron for another body?

171
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,380
等有30个聊天室了告诉我
When we get up to 30 rooms, you let me know.

172
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,000
我们已经寄出了
We already sent out mailers

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,950
有软件重装说明的邮件广告
with instructions on reinstalling the software.

174
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,410
-但他们还在取消订阅  -当然了
- They're still cancelling. - Well, of course they are.

175
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,580
你把淋病传给女朋友了
You just gave your girlfriend the clap.

176
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,970
你觉得几封邮件就能弥补吗
You think sendin' out mailers is gonna fix that?

177
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,500
你得送花  青霉素可没用
You gotta send her flowers, not penicillin.

178
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,660
那你说怎么办
What do you suggest we do?

179
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,690
首先  你们需要修复公司形象
First of all, your image needs rehabilitation.

180
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,270
我看到有张发票
I noticed an invoice here

181
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,140
是《字节》杂志的预付广告位
for prepaid ad space in "Byte Magazine."

182
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,270
利用广告来改变形象
Look, use this to change the story.

183
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,040
听起来不错  但我们雇不起广告公司
That sounds great, but we can't afford an ad agency right now.

184
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,890
不  你们不需要广告公司
No, you don't need one.

185
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,940
就两个大号黑体字  招聘
Two words in bold black lettering-- we're hiring.

186
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,370
看到这个  人们会觉得你们现在风生水起
Folks see that, they think you're cooking on the front burner.

187
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,300
再加上点色彩  也许会更好
Look, and a little splash of color would be nice in there somewhere.

188
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,120
吸引目光  也不会花很多钱
Draw the eye, won't break the bank.

189
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,740
嗯  可以贴张员工工作照
Yeah, maybe a photo of our staff at work.

190
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,440
那绝对显眼
Yeah, that'll really pop.

191
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,860
博迪和神童趴在键盘上埋头苦干
What, Bodie and Wonderboy hunched over their keyboards?

192
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,960
也许能让人们想到
Yeah, or it'll remind people

193
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,130
史蒂夫·乔布斯在车库创办苹果的事呢
of Steve Jobs starting Apple in his garage.

194
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,930
这事总是能引起人们的兴趣
People can't seem to get enough of that old chestnut.

195
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,800
不能再电话推销了  你得挨家挨户上门谈
No more cold calls. You've got to go door-to-door.

196
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,100
-博斯  没那么多人手  -冲大鱼下手
- Boz, we don't have the manpower. - Just go after the whales.

197
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,970
大鱼  最大的客户
Your whales, your top dogs.

198
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,690
我标出来的这十个名字
Those 10 names that I highlighted here,

199
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,850
是你们最大的买家
these are your biggest spenders.

200
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,010
就从他们入手
Start with them.

201
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,390
好吧  我想可以派莱夫去
Uh, okay, I guess we could send Lev out.

202
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,520
他看起来比较正常
He k-kind of passes for normal.

203
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,190
不行  我需要莱夫帮我做社区呢
Oh, no, no, I need Lev for Community.

204
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,580
-为什么  -我们有近20个聊天室了
- Why? - We're up to almost 20 rooms.

205
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,040
-什么  好多  -是啊
- What? That's huge. - I know,

206
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,730
这算是个好消息吧
that's a little bit of good news, right?

207
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,970
什么时候的事
W-when did that happen?

208
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,690
就今早上  他给我看了...
Just this morning. He showed me--

209
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,790
女士们  现在你们该说
Ladies, this is where you say,

210
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,660
"你能帮我们办这件事吗  博斯沃思
"Could you please do this for us, Bosworth?

211
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,310
你可是个传奇推销员呢"
"You are an unbelievable salesman."

212
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,380
我说  "不  那已经是过去的我了"
And I say, "No, that chapter in my life is closed."

213
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,550
你们说  "拜托  就帮我们这一次吧"
And then you say, "Please do us this favor?"

214
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,240
我说  "不  我不能"
And I say, "No, I cannot."

215
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,560
我们就这样你来我往几次
And then it goes back and forth like that a couple more times

216
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,940
然后我再答应
and I say yes.

217
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,150
谢谢
Thanks.

218
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,010
接下来交给我吧
I can take it from here.

219
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,520
这要怎么往工作订单上写
What am I supposed to write on the work order?

220
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,670
需要写吗
What work order?

221
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,690
怎么了  今天怎么只有我说啊
What's going on? Why am I the only one pitching today, guys?

222
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:42,340
天高任我行  不管什么想法都行
Come on, sky's the limit. Whatever-- whatever comes to mind.

223
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,470
各位  认真点
Come on, guys, let's get serious.

224
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,310
免得丢了股权
There's shares on the line here.

225
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,740
来吧
Yeah.

226
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,860
我们可以模仿《冰城传奇》出个游戏
Uh, we could do our version of "Bard's Tale,"

227
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,490
设定玩家要救的公主
but the players try to free a princess

228
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,270
其实是霍比特人乔装的
who's actually a Hobbit in disguise.

229
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,770
好吧  我觉得我们应该放宽思路
Okay, I think we need to go bigger.

230
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,430
也许是我没说清楚
Uh, maybe I'm not explaining it very well.

231
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,910
就是  玩家们...
You see, the players, um--

232
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,320
不如我们设计一款射击游戏
What if we create a shooter game

233
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,760
要完全拟真的
that's totally immersive?

234
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,230
从玩家的视角展现周围环境
That shows the player's perspective of his surroundings.

235
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,000
-你想在线上这么做  -对  怎么了
- And you want to try to do this online? - Yeah. What?

236
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,160
我清楚我们目前能达到的图像效果有限
I mean, I know we're more limited in the kind of graphics we can do,

237
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,920
但如果做成了  肯定很棒
but if we pulled it off, it would be amazing.

238
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,310
设置什么样的敌人  不要坦克外星人
Uh, what's a good enemy? And no tanks or aliens.

239
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,690
来些新点子
We need something fresh.

240
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,690
-早上好  -抱歉来晚了
- Morning. - Sorry, I got held up.

241
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,330
你还可以提前下班
Okay, leave a little earlier.

242
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,650
-有了  -说
- Okay, I... I got it. - Yeah.

243
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,000
赶在ET吃你的锐滋豆前找到并杀了它
Find and kill E.T. before he eats your Reese's Pieces.

244
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,870
不行
No!

245
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,110
博迪  太差劲了
Bodie, that's, like, the worst.

246
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,740
想不出来就散会吧
Okay, let's stop while we're stuck

247
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,410
明天再讨论
and then we can pick up again tomorrow.

248
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,560
好吧
Good?

249
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,390
那个简直
Well, that was...

250
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,340
博迪  这主意糟透了
Bodie, it was a bad idea.

251
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,530
他想吃糖果就随他  怎么能杀ET
He will eat candy. You cannot kill E.T.

252
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,810
只是锐滋豆啊
It's just some Reese's Pieces.

253
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,990
要不你也住进来  会不会好点
Sorry, would you be more comfortable in one of the bedrooms?

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,460
不用  我很好  补充点能量就好
No, no, I'm good. I just need to fuel up.

255
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,200
-你怎么了  -没事
- What's going on with you? - Nothing.

256
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,410
就是睡过头了
I just-- I slept through my alarm

257
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,010
可能真的太累了
and I guess I'm just really tired.

258
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,150
我们都很累
Okay, we're all really tired.

259
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,930
不能因为没工资拿了
Just because you're not getting paid anymore

260
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,340
就上班迟到
doesn't mean you can show up late for work.

261
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,340
-影响士气  -不会再犯了
- It's bad for morale. - It won't happen again.

262
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,610
-好的  -好
- Okay. - Okay.

263
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,940
我都没看到你
I didn't see you there.

264
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
-等很久了吗  -才到
- You been waiting long? - Just got here.

265
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,250
我刚在跑步
Oh, I was out doing my miles.

266
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,590
跑了9英里
Did-- did nine miles.

267
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,560
来杯冰沙吗  我自己也要弄一杯喝
You want a smoothie? I'm making one for myself.

268
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,220
好  你什么时候开始喝冰沙了
Sure. When did you start drinking smoothies?

269
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,030
稍等  我走近点
Hold on, let me get closer.

270
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,080
之前说要健康生活
I wasn't kidding there when I told you

271
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,160
我可没开玩笑
I was getting back into shape.

272
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,030
1985对我是重要的一年
You know, 1985's my year, man.

273
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,320
饮食均衡  勤加锻炼
I'm eating better, I'm exercising.

274
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,580
我好久没长期慢跑了
You know, I haven't jogged regularly since,

275
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,800
都记不得有多久了
I mean, I don't even know.

276
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,930
阿迪达斯推出了这套田径服
Adidas came out with that track suit.

277
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,830
是啊  已经值了
Exactly. It's already paying off, too.

278
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,450
昨天医生来电说  我的血液检查结果很好
Doctor called yesterday, said that my blood work's good.

279
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,800
身体状态就像25岁的人一样
Said I've got the body of a 25-year-old.

280
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,770
好了
All right.

281
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,850
我编程了这个遥控装置
I programmed the remote

282
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,780
可以打开家里所有电器
to turn on all the electrical appliances in the house.

283
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,740
挺有创意的吧
Pretty innovative, huh?

284
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,050
我也在西方集团能源做一些革新性的工作
You know, I've been doing some innovative stuff at Westgroup Energy.

285
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,670
石油产业正遭受重创  需要多样化
Oil's taking a big hit and the industry needs to diversify, so...

286
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,430
这是把西方集团带进信息时代的绝佳时机
It's a perfect moment to take Westgroup into the Information Age.

287
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,990
听说过分时吗
Um, have you heard about time-sharing?

288
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,590
听说过
Yeah, I've heard of time-sharing.

289
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,200
西方集团有一台全新的IBM 3090主机
Westgroup's got a brand-spankin'-new IBM 3090 mainframe

290
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,600
仍在公测阶段  放在市区总部
still in beta at headquarters downtown.

291
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,460
先从那里入手
I'm starting there 

292
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,240
下一步就是伦敦和纽约的3081主机
and then moving to the 3081 in London and New York.

293
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,950
天呐  利润率肯定很大
Wow, shit. Profit margins will be huge.

294
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,860
是啊  比起来  阿帕网就像个土电话
Yeah, it'll make ARPANET look like two tin cans and a fishing line.

295
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,560
我需要一个底层工程师
So I'm looking for a ground-floor engineer

296
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,630
修改主机配置  实现外部接入
to convert the mainframes for outside dial-in access.

297
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,190
慢着  你不是在挖我吧
Wait, you're not trying to sell me on this, are you?

298
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,460
不  我们只是聊聊  你太多心了
No, we're just talking. You're reading too much into it.

299
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,660
我要找个人  你是我认识的最棒的工程师
I'm looking for someone. You're the best engineer I know.

300
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,210
我想先来问过你
I wanted to give you the first right of refusal.

301
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,130
你应该高兴
Be flattered.

302
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,880
我是很高兴  而且我拒绝
I am flattered, all right? And I refuse.

303
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,130
-我还以为咱们处得不错呢  -的确不错
- I thought we were getting along. - We are getting along.

304
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,390
不要谈合作了  免得毁了这份关系
Let's not ruin it by jumping back into business together.

305
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,880
来嘛  就干一天
Come on, it's one day's work.

306
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,630
他们用的还是卡迪夫系统的软件
They're still running Cardiff Systems software.

307
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,310
你闭着眼睛都能搞定
You could do it with your eyes closed.

308
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:51,250
你上周邀请我和唐娜共进晚餐
When you invited me and Donna to dinner last week,

309
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,410
是为了讨好我  让我帮你吗
was that to butter me up for this?

310
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,650
我请你们吃饭的时候还没想到这个呢
I didn't even have this idea when I invited you to dinner.

311
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,900
莎拉是你未婚妻吗
Is Sara even your fiance,

312
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,470
还是你雇来的
or is that just some person that you hired

313
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,360
好让别人觉得你正常  值得信任
to make yourself seem normal and trustworthy?

314
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,530
这话听起来太疯狂了
Now you just sound crazy.

315
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,840
不  疯狂是一遍遍重复做同样的事
No, crazy is doing the same thing over and over again

316
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,110
还指望得到不同的结果
and expecting a different result.

317
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,150
你知道这个技术领域正在爆炸性增长吧
You do understand this area of tech is exploding, right?

318
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,790
过个一年半  咱们的规模会比计算机服务大五倍
In 18 months, we'll be bigger than CompuServe by a power of five.

319
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,810
你一年半后会在哪里
Where will you be in 18 months?

320
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:14,910
不好说
I don't know.

321
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,540
也许花着我靠巨人赚来的钱
Maybe drinking mai tais poolside in Maui

322
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,540
躺在毛伊岛的泳池边喝鸡尾酒
off all the money I made on the Giant.

323
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,120
对不起  乔  你还是找别人吧
I'm sorry, Joe. You're gonna have to find somebody else.

324
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,010
-小伙子  你爸爸在家吗  -没在家
- Oh, hey there, son. Is your daddy home? - No.

325
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:33,980
他什么时候回来
When do you expect him?

326
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,510
这问题谁都想知道呢
Well, that's the million-dollar question.

327
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,500
不管你卖什么  我都没兴趣
Look, whatever you're selling, I'm not interested.

328
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,960
夫人  我不是来卖东西的
Ma'am, I'm not selling anything.

329
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,890
我名叫约翰·博斯沃思
My name's John Bosworth, by the way.

330
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,050
我是一家叫穆特尼的公司的客户满意度部主管
I'm head of Customer Satisfaction at a company called Mutiny.

331
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:47,800
我今早过来  只是想向您儿子
I just came by this morning to apologize to your son here

332
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,620
为这周网络的扰动而道歉
about all our network hassles this week

333
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,890
并想办法劝他回到穆特尼的大家庭里
and see what I can do to bring him back into the Mutiny family.

334
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,550
不必了  是我取消了订阅
Nothing. I'm the one that cancelled the subscription, okay?

335
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,970
他用我的信用卡刷了上百美元
He's been racking up hundreds of dollars on my credit card.

336
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,950
我都不记得他多久没往家里带学校的小伙伴了
Can't remember the last time that he had a friend home from school.

337
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,870
我是说...
I mean...

338
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:08,000
你们这些电子游戏公司和毒贩子差不多
You video game companies are no better than drug peddlers.

339
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,550
对不起  夫人  没想到我们的服务
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am. I didn't realize our services

340
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,220
影响了您儿子的社交生活
had disrupted your boy's social life.

341
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,180
-你几年级了  孩子  -九年级
- What grade are you in, son? - Ninth.

342
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,130
你妈妈说得对
Yeah, your mama's right.

343
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,540
你应该多花点时间和学校里的朋友玩
You gotta spend more time with your buddies at school.

344
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,220
他们只会聊体育
All they talk about is sports.

345
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,700
不是这样的  加文呢
Well, that's not true. What about Gavin?

346
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,070
你有和穆特尼的用户成为朋友吗
Have any of these Mutiny users become friends of yours?

347
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,340
有  大概32个吧
Oh, yeah, like 32.

348
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,370
就是经常和我聊天的
Well, that I talk to regularly.

349
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,660
有六七个只想跟我一较高下
Maybe six or seven that just want to play against me,

350
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,010
但是也挺有意思的
which is also fun.

351
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,630
我都不懂你是怎么跟那帮人交流的
I don't understand how you're talking to all these people.

352
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,940
你玩电脑时明明一句话都不说啊
I never hear a peep out of you when you're down there.

353
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,780
我妈妈是个老古董
My mother's a Luddite.

354
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,890
我们给对方发送信息
We type messages to each other.

355
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,750
网上就是这么交流的
That's how you talk online.

356
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,200
太太  我们俩都太过时了  没法理解他们
Ma'am, you and I are too old school to understand this,

357
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,210
但对于您儿子和他的朋友来说
but to your son here and his friends,

358
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,570
穆特尼就是他们的教堂
Mutiny is the church.

359
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,610
他们能在那里找到与自己志同道合的人
It's where they find community.

360
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,950
有时候也只在那里能找到
Sometimes that's the only place.

361
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,460
祝二位今天愉快
You have a good day.

362
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,820
不好意思耽搁了您这么久
I'm sorry to have taken up so much of your time.

363
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,060
等等  你说你叫什么来着
Wait, um, what'd you say your name was again?

364
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,350
约翰
It's John.

365
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,510
约翰·博斯沃思
John Bosworth.

366
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,720
你在找我吗
I heard you were looking for me?

367
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,330
是的
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um,

368
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,390
我在做清点
okay, so I've been doing some inventory,

369
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,340
想看看我们能放弃哪些游戏
trying to figure out what games we can afford to lose

370
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,860
来减轻网络负担
to help lighten the network.

371
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,760
好主意  你想要我的建议还是...
That's smart. Did you want suggestions or...

372
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,100
我在想
Well, I was thinking that

373
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,710
双陆棋和西洋跳棋必须砍
Backgammon and Checkers are no-brainers.

374
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,190
这两个用户最少  也不是我们原创的
They're our lowest performers and not one of our originals.

375
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,360
是啊  说得很对
Yeah, that's great.

376
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,750
而且我还得关掉社区
And I'm gonna have to cut Community.

377
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,270
-为什么  -这个嘛
- Why? - Well...

378
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,250
社区唯一占用的带宽是用户打字
The only bandwidth it takes up is people on it typing,

379
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,330
而打字最快的人也快不过最慢的电话调制器
and no one types as fast as even the slowest telephone modem.

380
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,960
与带宽无关  而是安全问题
It's not about bandwidth. It's about security.

381
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,770
社区最容易受攻击
Community's our most vulnerable spot.

382
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,250
有人分享了问题文件我们就会再次受影响
Someone shares the wrong file, we get infected again.

383
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,470
我不能冒险再出现这样的事
I just-- I can't take a chance on that happening.

384
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,120
如果你想让社区成为大家交流的地方
If you want to make this a place where people can connect,

385
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,710
那么就必然有风险
then there's going to be risk involved.

386
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,660
我知道
I know.

387
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,870
我不想为这么小的项目冒险
I'm just not willing to take a risk on something so small.

388
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,540
一周之内用户增加到原来的三倍
We've tripled in a week.

389
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,050
许多用户都不是游戏玩家
A lot of our users aren't even gamers

390
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,910
维护起来又只需要很少的人力
and it requires very little manpower,

391
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,610
所以我得跟你说实话
so I have to be honest with you,

392
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,680
我认为从商业角度来看
I think this is a huge mistake

393
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,030
这个决定大错特错
from a business standpoint.

394
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,910
我知道了
Noted.

395
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,880
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

396
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,280
-给我  -对不起
- Give me that. - I'm sor-- sorry.

397
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,640
对不起  对不起
Sorry, sorry!

398
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,270
饶命
Uncle!

399
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,260
我的天
Jesus!

400
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,590
你差点把我吓尿了
God, you scared the shit out of me.

401
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,750
你在做...你在这儿多久了
What are you do-- how long have you been in here?

402
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,610
你和女儿们回家以后
Since you and the girls got home.

403
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,530
她们不会来这儿找我
It's the only place they don't look for me.

404
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,520
我今天过得很不好
I've had a day.

405
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,970
好吧  我了解那种感觉
Okay, well, I know that feeling.

406
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,540
我曾经几周都不顺  你怎么了
I had weeks like that. What hapned?

407
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,200
社区聊天室刚开始有起色
Cameron's cutting all of my community rooms

408
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,130
卡梅伦却要全部撤掉
just when they're taking off.

409
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,820
而且她还客客气气的
And she was so polite about it, too.

410
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,110
正正经经的  我真受不了
All business. It was unbearable.

411
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,480
你总是说
Well, you're always saying

412
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,900
希望她能更专业一些
how you wished she'd be more professional.

413
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,060
是啊  但不是来对付我
Yeah, but not against me.

414
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,880
我们应该是同一阵线的
We're supposed to be partners.

415
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,180
不如你脱掉衣服真正泡个澡吧
Why don't you get undressed and take an actual bath, okay?

416
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,240
我哄女儿们睡觉再给你叫个外卖
I'll put the girls to bed and I'll order takeout for you

417
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,190
-你想吃什么我就点什么  -我不饿
- from whatever restaurant you want. - No, I'm not hungry.

418
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,620
你还记得
Do you remember

419
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,610
你第一次打开巨人电脑时
how you felt the first time you powered on the Giant

420
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,830
-就知道它会非比寻常的那种感觉吗  -记得
- and you knew it was something special? - Yeah.

421
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,060
第一个用户
Well, I felt the same way

422
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,370
进入我的社区聊天室时我也是这种感觉
when the first user entered my Community room.

423
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,410
就好像...
It was like--

424
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,290
我说不好  就像生孩子
I don't know, it was like giving birth.

425
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,920
你懂吗  我知道听起来很疯狂
You know? I know that sounds crazy.

426
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,250
一点也不疯狂
Look, it doesn't sound crazy at all.

427
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:26,960
你创造了它  它就是你的孩子
Look, you created it. It is your baby.

428
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,730
是啊
Yeah.

429
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,800
你能理解我真好
It's really nice that you get it.

430
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,620
我不知道  我不知道我能不能行
I don't know. I don't know if I'm cut out for this.

431
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,730
你可以的  好吗
Hey, look, you can do this, okay?

432
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,110
你是当局者迷  但我看得出来
You're too lost to see it, but I can see it.

433
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,440
别管卡梅伦的想法
Forget what Cameron thinks.

434
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,030
这是个好创意
This is a big idea.

435
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,690
你一定要坚持下去
You have to see it through.

436
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,390
那又有什么用呢  就算...
But what's the point? Even if--

437
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,190
就算我们把所有XT重新上线运转
even if we get all the XTs back up and running,

438
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,330
也没法依靠那个脆弱的自制网络长期维持下去
we can't survive long-term on a rickety, homemade network.

439
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,170
听着  你会想到办法的
Look, you'll-- you'll figure something out.

440
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,600
我要是在这儿躲到女儿们上床
Would I be a terrible mother

441
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,480
是不是个糟糕透顶的妈妈
if I stayed in here until the girls went to sleep?

442
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,390
是的
Yes.

443
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,110
你这么晚还出来
You're-- you're out late.

444
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:05,120
或是很早  看你的睡眠时间了
Or early, depending on your sleep schedule.

445
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,100
是啊  白天电话一直响
Uh, yeah, I couldn't get any work done

446
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,460
闹得我什么事都没做完
during the day with the phones ringing,

447
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,910
所以...我就是来买点零食
so I-- I'm just here to get snacks.

448
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,680
-嗯  -杂货店嘛...
- Right, yeah... - Grocery store, so...

449
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,310
-我不知道你在这儿工作  -其实是来卧底的
- I didn't know you worked here. - I'm actually here undercover.

450
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,790
为我们的游戏做点调查
Um, for our games. I'm doing some research.

451
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,580
已经想到个点子了  《理货小哥》
I got one already. "Stock Boy."

452
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,640
要求玩家
It's where the players have

453
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,270
在十分钟内理好所有架子
10 minutes to try and stock all the shelves

454
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:36,120
还要避开来找成人纸尿裤的老人
while dodging senior citizens on the hunt for adult diapers.

455
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,530
我高中时在这儿工作过
I used to work here in high school

456
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,830
所以经理给我安排了几轮班
and the manager let me pick up a couple shifts.

457
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,100
当然  就...
Yeah, of course, it's-- -

458
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,700
就到我的股份增值的时候
It's just till the shares are worth something.

459
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,870
很好
That's great.

460
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,910
也不是...非常好
I-- I mean, it's not, like, great.

461
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,000
火焰糖球
Yeah, the FireBall Jawbreakers,

462
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,610
在6号通道尽头的底层
they're at the bottom shelf at the end of aisle six,

463
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:54,960
好又多在同一道的中间
and the Good & Plentys are halfway down the same aisle,

464
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,050
不过是在右边
but they're on the right.

465
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,860
不难注意到  你身后总是留下一堆包装纸
It's hard to miss. You always leave a trail of wrappers in your wake.

466
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,790
好  好的
Cool. Uh... right.

467
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,800
一会儿见
I'll see you in a few.

468
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,100
-好  -好
- Yep. - Okay.

469
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,840
我的条件是  首先  我说了算
Here are my terms. First off, I'm in charge.

470
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,390
第二  我免费帮你
Second, I'll provide my services for free

471
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,380
但穆特尼要作你的第一个客户  好吗
in exchange for Mutiny being your first client, all right?

472
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,520
第三  这是试点工程
And third, dude, this is a pilot program.

473
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,330
给我个折扣
I expect a discounted rate.

474
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,630
你在穆特尼搞砸了什么事
So, what did you screw up over at Mutiny?

475
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,570
没有  我只是想帮我老婆
Nothing. I'm just trying to help out my wife.

476
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,060
我问问清楚
All right, let me get this straight.

477
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,980
唐娜问过你卡梅伦的公司
Donna asked you if Cameron's company

478
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,540
能不能做我的试点工程吗
could be my pilot program.

479
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,830
他们走投无路了
They're desperate.

480
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,820
也不至于  他们公司状况很好
They're not desperate. Look, the company's in great shape.

481
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,890
我们成交还是怎样
Do we have a deal or not?

482
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,590
好吧  我列了个设备列表
All right, I put together an equipment list.

483
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:56,190
告诉你  修改主机配置以安装分时系统
Just so you know, converting the mainframes for time-sharing

484
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,840
不是扳个开关那么简单
isn't as easy as just flipping a switch.

485
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,520
{\pos(148,252)}贝尔公司推出
可用同一根电话线传输多个用户的数据的机器

486
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,520
光设置T1连接  就需要几天时间
I mean, the T-1 connections alone are gonna take a few days.

487
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,940
我已经装了3根T1高速线进去了
I already had three T-1 high-speed lines installed.

488
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,270
你只需要给连接好
I just need you to finish the connections

489
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,740
再装上IBM的分时运行功能就好
and install IBM's time-sharing option.

490
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,820
{\pos(242,252)}也是分时运行系统

491
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,820
好吧  我们应该用密歇根终端系统All right. Well, we should use Michigan Terminal Systems.

492
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,830
比IBM的可靠的多
You know, it's much more reliable than IBM.

493
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,130
你今晚能开工吗
Could you do it tonight?

494
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,290
-为什么要今晚  -行不行吧  戈登
- Why tonight? - Can you do it or can't you, Gordon?

495
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,560
可以  可以
Yeah, yeah, I could do it.

496
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,920
很好  你拿上这些东西
Great, why don't you grab this stuff

497
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,880
我们8点在街对面的酒吧见
and meet me at the bar across the street at 8:00?

498
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,350
你干吗不拿上东西  然后8点在酒吧见我
Why don't you grab this stuff and meet me at the bar at 8:00?

499
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,080
好吧  在我滚蛋之前要问一下
Okay, um, before I go screw myself,

500
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,920
你上次打电话
when was the last time that

501
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,230
计算机服务的老板接听是什么时候
you got the head of CompuServe on the phone?

502
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,530
还有  我们不是计算机服务
Also, we're not CompuServe!

503
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,110
怎么
Yeah?

504
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,210
-我好像来得不巧  -没事  请进
- This a bad time? - Huh? No, no, come in.

505
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,800
就是在做客服
Just doing some customer service.

506
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,430
我能问你个问题吗
Can I ask you a question?

507
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,600
你用过穆特尼社区吗
Have you ever used Mutiny Community?

508
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,990
用过
Yeah.

509
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,010
-你想问什么  -这就是我的问题
- What's your question? - That. That was my question.

510
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,700
我觉得你决定放弃它之前  至少应该试试
I just thought you should try it before you decide to drop it.

511
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,410
但既然你用过了  那你来决定吧
But you have, so I'll leave it to you.

512
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,450
好吧
Okay.

513
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,400
你最喜欢哪个聊天室
What's your favorite room?

514
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,380
什么
What?

515
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,830
你最喜欢的聊天室  大家都有所偏好
Your favorite room. All the guys have one.

516
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,120
我就想问问
I'm just curious.

517
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,980
我知道社区是什么
I know what Community is.

518
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,290
恕我直言  我觉得你不知道
With respect, I disagree.

519
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,900
只是单纯的文本
It's simple text

520
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,840
没有图像  也毫无可玩性
with no graphical capability or playability.

521
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,790
我说错了吗
Am I wrong?

522
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,400
代码虽然简单
The code might not be revolutionary,

523
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,210
但用户间的互动
but the interactions between users

524
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,570
是一种全新的交流方式
are a completely new way of communicating.

525
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,000
人们可以在网络上释放出真实的自我
People can be more authentic online than in real life,

526
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,060
这会让人上瘾
and that is addictive.

527
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,380
好吧
Okay, fine.

528
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,750
我会试试社区
I'll give a spin in Community.

529
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,130
但别指望我会改主意
Just don't expect me to change my mind.

530
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,430
是因为你不喜欢
Because you just don't like it

531
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,510
还是因为它不是你的主意
or because it didn't come from you?

532
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,580
{\an8}{\pos(124.5,74.607)}待定

533
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,580
{\pos(266.1,51.743)}{\an8}成交

534
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,030
能重开暖气了吗
Can we turn the heat back on now?

535
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:19,060
得了  去买条新羊绒裙子吧  小妞
Aw, come on. Get yourself a new wool skirt, milady.

536
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,930
我们又争取回一个用户
We just got back another subscriber.

537
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,870
我觉得我们该庆祝一下
I think we should celebrate.

538
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,970
这是卡梅伦买来今晚喝的
Cameron bought those for tonight.

539
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,700
是啊  我们还在上班
Oh, right, we're still on the clock.

540
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,890
没有吧
Or are we?

541
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,240
当心
Heads up.

542
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,430
喝  喝  喝
Drink! Drink! Drink!

543
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,620
你全洒在我的股份上了  让我怎么活
You're spilling on my shares. How am I gonna feed myself?

544
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,030
老天啊
God, man.

545
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,990
{\an7}{\pos(103.2,98.273)}您想跟卡梅豪伊私聊吗

那条信息发送给所有人了
Um, that went to everyone.

564
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,050
-你说什...  -所有人
- What do you-- - Everyone.

565
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,400
我知道现在告诉你不太合适
I know this isn't the best time to tell you this,

566
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,470
但免得你以后再搞错
but for future reference,

D+shift+感叹号
the letter D plus the shift key plus exclamation mark

{\an7}卡梅豪伊 :     不  戈登=让唐娜生了两个孩子害她拖家带口的男人

570
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,840
好了  东西都放在后备箱里呢
All right, I got everything in my trunk.

571
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,850
我没时间把它们捆好
I didn't have time to tape them all to one sheet,

572
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,820
替我开个报销单  好吗
so fill out the expense report for me, will ya?

573
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,910
你们有锚牌蒸汽啤酒吗
Hey, any chance you guys carry Anchor Steam?

574
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,140
那随便给我杯啤酒吧
Well, uh, give me whatever's that's on tap.

575
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,040
我身上只有这些了
That's all I got on me.

576
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,720
剩下的周末再给你
I'll give you the rest by the end of the week.

577
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,230
你干吗自己贴钱啊
Why are you reimbursing me with your own money?

578
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,030
你给我搞到通行证了吗
Did you get me that security badge?

579
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,700
你不需要通行证
You don't need a security badge.

580
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,110
-为什么  -都下班了
- Why not? - It's after hours.

581
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:45,130
正因为这样我才需要通行证啊
Isn't that all the more reason I need a security badge?

582
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,220
乔
Joe?

583
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,420
我也想按章办事
I tried to do this all by the book,

584
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,710
但有个白痴碍事
but I was getting stonewalled by some half-wit lifer

585
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,350
-他连什么是被动收入  -难以置信
- who couldn't even understand the concept - Oh, unbelievable.

586
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,620
都不懂
of passive income.

587
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,320
我觉得你就不懂什么是诚实
Look, I don't think you understand the concept of good faith.

588
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,180
我知道如果我告诉你这是我个人的主意
I knew if I told you I was doing this on the side,

589
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,540
-你肯定会小题大做  -"个人的主意"
- you'd make a big deal about it. - Oh, "on the side."

590
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,840
这就是大事
No, it is a big deal.

591
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,420
你为什么不去跟你准岳父说
Why didn't you take this to your future father-in-law?

592
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,570
这主意很棒啊
Okay? It's a great idea.

593
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,660
他不会像你那样理解我的设想
He wouldn't get my vision the way you did.

594
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,290
只是我的一席空话
It would just be words.

595
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,800
我需要证据  才能让他相信我
I needed evidence to back it up so he could trust me.

596
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,480
要赢得他的信任  最棒的办法
And what better way to earn his trust

597
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,430
莫过于大半夜闯进他的公司
than to break into his building in the middle of the night

598
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,470
摆弄他的最先进的主机
and mess with his state-of-the-art mainframe?

599
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,300
-这招数更好  -好吧
- It's a better play. - Oh, it's a better play.

600
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,610
-莎拉知道吗  -她今晚在奥斯汀过夜
- Does Sara know about this? - She's in Austin for the night.

601
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,860
好啊  那我们打给她
Mm, all right, well, let's call her up,

602
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,640
跟她说说我们要做什么
tell her what we're about to do,

603
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,370
如果她不介意  那我就乐意帮忙
and if she's okay with it, then I'm happy to help.

604
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,150
好啊  我们先打给唐娜
Okay, after we call up Donna

605
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,290
告诉她  她今后要从我这儿租网了
and tell her that she'll be leasing her new network from me.

606
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,950
听着  我和唐娜
Listen, Donna and I,

607
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,440
我们从不隐瞒彼此什么
we don't hide anything from each other.

608
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,470
好啊  那我们打给她
Great, let's call her up.

609
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,940
我很想跟她打个招呼呢
I'd love to say hi.

610
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,230
我现在真想揍你一拳
You know, I'd like to punch you in the face right now.

611
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,520
自便
Be my guest.

612
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,190
好吧  我撒谎了  我不会用社区
Okay, I lied. I don't know how to use Community.

613
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,680
你如果都不尊重我
How is anybody supposed to respect me

614
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,520
别人怎么会尊重我
when you're disrespecting me?

615
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,320
-这你想到了吗  -没有
- Did you think about that? - No.

616
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,890
你跟汤姆聊天的时候想到这一点了吗
Did you think about that at all when you were messaging with Tom?

617
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:15,310
没有  老实说  我什么都没想
No, I-I... honestly, I wasn't thinking at all.

618
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,820
-是啊  -你要我去跟所有人道歉吗
- Yeah. - Do you want me to go apologize to everyone?

619
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,980
不  别那么做  什么都别做
No, don't do that. Don't do anything.

620
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,740
唐娜  你就没有私下里
Donna, haven't you ever said something shitty

621
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,440
说过你在公共场合绝不会说的关于别人的坏话吗
about somebody in private that you'd never say in public?

622
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,420
言不由衷的坏话
That you don't really mean?

623
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,050
重点不在这儿
That's not what we're talking about.

624
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,560
你如果对戈登有意见  你跟我说
If you have a problem with Gordon, you come to me.

625
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,310
你不可以在我背后议论
You don't talk about it behind my back

626
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:36,130
而且你永远不可以谈论我的孩子
and you don't ever... don't ever talk about my kids.

627
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,280
-你没事吧  -嗯
- Whoa, are you okay? - Yeah.

628
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,990
-要水吗  -不用  我没事
- Do you want water? - No, I'm fine.

629
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:47,060
我觉得我还染上琼妮的流感了
I just think on top of everything else I have Joanie's flu.

630
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,410
对不起
I'm really sorry.

631
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,420
你知道你和汤姆私聊时
You know that feeling of freedom that you had

632
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,220
那种自在的感觉
when you're sending private messages with Tom?

633
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,540
那种有个地方可以跟人
That feeling that you had a place to go

634
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,810
说些当面不会说的话的感觉
where you could say things you wouldn't say in person?

635
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,270
那
That...

636
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,140
那就是社区的价值所在
that is the value of Community.

637
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,470
需要你们
I need you in there.

638
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,480
我们在为《字节》杂志的广告拍集体照
We're doing the group photo for the "Byte" ad.

639
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,040
我在采取高中照全班照的方式
I'm doing a take on class photos from high school,

640
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,440
但没了你俩  感觉就像85届节欲俱乐部
and without you two, it looks like the abstinence club of 1985.

641
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,140
好了  伙计们  大家把啤酒放下
Okay, guys. Guys, guys, can we put down the beer

642
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,970
就忍五分钟
for, like... just, like, five minutes?

643
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,360
五分钟  你站这里
Five minutes, okay? Okay, you're gonna come right here.

644
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,110
这里  放那边
Right here. Put it down over there.

645
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,340
过来  排好
Come here, come here. Get in line.

646
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,540
神童  站这儿  好了
Wonderboy, right here. Okay, here we go.

647
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,310
好了
Nice and...

648
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,550
抱歉  站好队
Sorry. Stand there in the line.

649
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,840
看看
Take a look at this.

650
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,930
好了  慢着  博迪呢  伙计们
Okay. Wait, where's... where's Bodie, guys?

651
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,510
他蹲厕所呢  汤姆
Eh, he's in the bathroom, Tom.

652
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,430
蹲厕所  谁去叫他一下啊
He's in the bathroom? Well, can someone go get him?

653
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,190
拜托  伙计们  这里简直像托儿所
Please? Jesus, guys, I feel like I'm running a nursery here.

654
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,000
好了  严肃点  把啤酒放下
Okay, tighten up, guys. Put down the beer.

655
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,340
好了  不行
Okay, here we... no, no, no, no, no.

656
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,940
你得站到中间来
Here, you gotta come front and center.

657
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,140
唐娜  中间  好吗
Donna, front and center. Okay?

658
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,660
好了  就这儿  真棒  谢谢
Okay? Right here. That's great. Thank you.

659
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,820
好了  不错  数到三
Okay, this is looking good, guys. Okay, on three.

660
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,350
笑起来  一  二  三
Big smiles. One, two, three.

661
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,730
唐娜  卡梅伦  简直太棒了
Donna, Cameron, that is perfect.

662
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:23,300
你俩嘴角能不能上扬一点
Do you mind lifting the corners of your mouths?

663
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,100
上扬一大点  好吗  我拍了
Like a whole lot? Okay? Here we go.

664
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,240
好了  数到三  莱夫  你挡住神童了
Okay, on three. Lev, Lev, you're blocking Wonderboy.

665
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,260
-好吗  -不戴眼镜我听不清
- Okay? - I can't hear without my glasses.

666
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,040
不戴眼镜听不清啊
You can't hear without your glasses.

667
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,000
这衣服是我新买的
I just bought this shirt!

668
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,240
好了  神童  神童
Okay, guys. Wonderboy! Wonderboy!

669
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,100
神童  别闹了  好吗
Wonderboy, just stop, okay?

670
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,070
大家别闹了  你们站好吧
Everybody just stop. Can we just get together?

671
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,720
就一分钟
Just for, like, one minute?!

672
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,590
很好  笑开点  好吗
Good, great. Big smiles, all right?

673
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,850
天呐  一  二...
Jesus. One, two...

674
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:58,290
-这可好  谢了  -我看上去怎么样
- That's great. That's great. Thanks. - Did it look good?

675
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,570
难看死了  真好
Complete disaster. That's good.

676
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,930
把酒给我
Give me that beer. Give me that beer.

677
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,020
小心
Watch out!

678
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,860
趴下
Get down!

679
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,780
小心
Watch it!

680
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,080
小心  他是红队的
Watch out, he's on red team!

681
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,670
打他  那边呢
Get him! He's over there.

682
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,900
-卡尔  -嗯
- Hey, Carl? - Uh, yeah?

683
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,620
你把社区下线了吗
Did you take down Community yet?

684
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,700
没呢
Oh, um, no,

685
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,540
但我今晚走之前会弄的
but I promise I'll do it before I leave tonight.

686
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,010
我现在挺清醒的
And I'm pretty sober, so...

687
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,380
不用了
No, it's...

688
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,080
再留几天吧
just leave it up for a few more days, okay?

689
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,210
好极了  我现在根本不清醒
Okay, great, that's good 'cause I'm not at all sober, so...

690
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:45,000
-谢了  回见  -来人了
- Thanks. See ya. - Man comin' in.

691
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,360
来人了  掩护我
Coming in! Cover me!

692
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,300
快加入游戏
Get your head in the game.

693
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,300
15秒后开始  红队
15 seconds. Red team.

694
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,330
15秒后我就开始打你了
You got 15 seconds before I shoot you.

695
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:55,270
小心了
Look out, look out!

696
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:26,750
上
Okay, go.

697
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,900
好嘞
Okay, got it.

698
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,070
小心  桌子后面  打他
Careful, behind the desk. Behind the desk! Get him! Get him!

699
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,720
趴下
Get down. Get down.

700
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,790
-走廊安全  -天呐
- Hallway's clear. - Oh, God!

701
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,930
-他们打中我了  他打中我了  -不
- They shot me! He got me. - No!

702
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,680
-没子弹了  -你死定了
- Out of ammo. - You're dead.

703
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:50,960
打中他了
Got him!

704
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,330
-你的枪归我了  -给我弹药
- Got your guns, babe. - Ammo.

705
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,360
-用他的枪  -主啊  救救我
- Here, take his gun. - Lord, help me.

706
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,430
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

707
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,380
卡梅伦  小心  找掩护
Cameron, watch out! Take cover!

708
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,960
你很想开枪吧
Oh, you wanna shoot me so bad.

709
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,160
为什么  因为你不给工资了
Why? Because you stopped paying us,

710
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,510
却还是使唤我们吗
but you're still riding all our asses?

711
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,810
-嗯  差不多吧  -而且你专横
- Yeah, something along those lines. - And you're imperious

712
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,250
固执  而且你从不给出有建设性的批评
and you're stubborn and you never, ever give constructive criticism.

713
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,460
知道了  我是个坏老板
I get it, I'm a horrible boss.

714
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,150
其实  这些我都很喜欢
Actually, I like all that about you.

715
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,710
你为什么还不开枪
So... why haven't you taken a shot at me yet?

716
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,460
不知道
I don't know.

717
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,640
因为我真的很想开枪
'Cause I sure as hell want to,

718
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,800
但我又希望你能留在游戏里
but I also kind of want you in the game.

719
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,970
是吗
Yeah?

720
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,110
-就是这个  -什么
- That's it. - What's it?

721
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,390
这个
This.

722
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,680
我们在线上创造这个游戏
We create this game online.

723
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,780
-我们争不过卡带游戏  对吧  -嗯
- We can't compete with box games, right? - Yeah.

724
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,710
但我们的优势在于联网
But what we have going for us is we're networked.

725
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:04,010
不要再做射击坦克或机器人的游戏了
Instead of shooting at a tank or a robot,

726
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:07,210
我们让用户能在我们的网络上射击其他用户
what if you're shooting at another user on our network?

727
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:08,480
人类玩家不像
I mean, human players aren't

728
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,140
计算机生成的敌人那么好猜透
predictable like a computer-generated enemy.

729
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,890
如果你能
I mean, how cool would it be

730
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:15,410
直视对方的眼睛  那多酷啊
if you're looking right at them, eye to eye?

731
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,830
-你的朋友也是你的敌人  -对
- Your friend is also your enemy. - Yeah.

732
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,430
谁不会偶尔想打自己的朋友啊
I mean, who doesn't want to shoot their friend sometimes?

733
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,070
但是我们怎么在网络上构建图像
But how would we do the graphics over the network?

734
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,760
我们得...一半靠玩家电脑处理
We'd have to do... build half of it on the C64

735
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,050
-另一半通过网络传输  -对
- and then the other half on our network. - Yes.

736
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,850
{\pos(140,252)}康懋达64电脑

737
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,850
C64足以处理场景图像
And the C64, that can manage the scenery graphics

738
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,670
和玩家动作  我们来处理玩家位置
and the player movement, and we can manage the user's location,

739
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,990
决定他们能否看到彼此
whether or not they can... they can see each other,

740
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,610
以及分数  等等
the score, all that sort of thing.

741
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,890
我们还得建立一套
And we'd have to build a protocol

742
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,490
玩家和我们的电脑间的协议
between the user's computer and ours

743
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:35,460
这样我们就能控制游戏图像了
so that we can control the game graphics.

744
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,080
嗯  当然
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

745
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,660
做成简短  通用的指令
As long as they're short, encoded instructions.

746
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,770
嗯  以免拖慢游戏速度
Yeah, to keep the game speed up and...

747
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,240
天呐  我是你队友啊  混蛋
Jesus! I'm on your team, asshole.

748
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,970
别闹  我们工作呢
Excuse me, we're trying to work in here.

749
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,850
-兰顿呢  -他死了  我打死了他
- Hey, where's Rendon? - He's dead. I shot him.

750
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:53,590
回去告诉他  他女伴打电话来了
Well, go back and tell him that his date's on the phone.

751
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:56,870
汤姆  女人找
Yo, Tom, a lady's on the phone.

752
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,280
我得去了
Uh, I gotta go.

753
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,760
好吧  开心点
Okay, have fun.

754
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,580
真绅士啊
You're such a gentleman.

755
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,040
他往那边去了  打他
He went back that way! Get him!

756
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,600
再过两小时就有人来上班了
People are gonna be here in two hours.

757
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,120
好吧
Yeah, well...

758
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,240
还要多久
How much longer?

759
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,450
出门旅行时我女儿就爱这么问
You sound like my girls on a road trip.

760
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,350
你比以前慢了
You're slower than you used to be.

761
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,200
你要我像组装巨人专业版那样组装这个吗
Well, you want me to slap this thing together like the Giant Pro?

762
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,060
就快插好了
I'm almost done slotting.

763
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,300
然后还得上传虚拟主机
Then I gotta upload the hosting

764
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,310
和分时运行系统  这样...
and time-sharing options that'll switch the TSO...

765
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:44,850
那事不怪你  巨人专业版
That's not on you, the Giant Pro.

766
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:47,760
没有哪台机器能满足每个客户的一切需求
No one machine can be everything to every customer.

767
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,240
我们一定程度上都在瞎猜
We're all guessing in the dark to a certain extent.

768
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,250
嗯  我完全不知道客户想要什么
Yeah, well, I have no idea what consumers want

769
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,600
也猜够了
and I'm sick and tired of trying to figure it out.

770
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,770
知道吗
You know, I wish...

771
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,510
真希望大家能告诉我他们究竟想要什么
I wish people would just tell me exactly what they want

772
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,000
我就会去给他们搭建了
and then I would go and build it.

773
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,270
就像给客人订制西装的裁缝
Like a tailor making a custom suit.

774
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,910
是啊  我什么都会建
Exactly. I can build anything.

775
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,510
我再去给你拿瓶可乐
Let me grab you a fresh Coke.

776
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,630
你怎么了
Hey, hey, what happened?

777
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,670
没事...我就是...
Oh, nothing. I just, uh...

778
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,440
我摔倒了  一定是绊倒了
I just fell. I must've tripped.

779
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,750
-绊在哪了  -脚卡在柜子边上了
- On what? - I caught my foot on the edge of the cabinet here.

780
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,680
我没事的
Look, I'm fine. I'm fine.

781
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,080
我们继续吧  都快日出了
Let's just keep going. Look, the sun's almost up.

782
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,640
戈登  你看上去不太好
Hey, Gordon, you don't look so good.

783
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,950
你是我妈啊
What are you, my mother?

784
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,870
多谢给我拿汽水
Thanks for the soda.

785
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:16,230
你来得好早
Well, you're here early.

786
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,380
嗯  有个人总不在家
Yeah, this one fella was never at home.

787
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,510
只能趁他要去上班
Only way to catch him was in his car,

788
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,470
正从车库里往外倒车的时候堵他
in the garage, as he pulled out on his way to work.

789
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,590
-来  -你知道...
- Here. - You know...

790
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,320
好了
All right.

791
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,360
我不会再求你来这儿工作了
I'm not gonna ask you to work here again, okay?

792
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,360
我告诉你
I'm telling you.

793
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:42,450
你明天就来上班  这里就是你的办公室
You start tomorrow. This is your office.

794
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,970
不用说  这里执行不闭门政策
It has an open-door policy, obviously,

795
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,710
因为这根本是个厨房
because it is the kitchen.

796
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,220
你的第一项任务
Your first task...

797
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:54,060
是帮我把这家公司做得更好
is I need you to help me run this company better.

798
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,930
是  女士

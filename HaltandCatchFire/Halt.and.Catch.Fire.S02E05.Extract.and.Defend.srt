00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,610
达拉斯比奥斯汀好的地方了
I like more about Dallas than Austin.

34
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,850
你在达拉斯
You're in Dallas.

35
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,890
该死的
Son of a bitch.

让我爸爸接电话
Put my dad on the phone.

39
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,340
我收到你寄来的礼物了
Got your little present in the mail.

40

你律师寄来的
The one from your lawyers.

41
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,040
即使我想  你就这么做吗
Even if I wanted to, this is how you do it?

42
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,850
问都不问问我
You don't even ask me about it?

43
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,130
不  这没得商量
No, this isn't up for debate.

44
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,410
可不是  爸爸
Yeah, no kidding, Dad.

45
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,390
我才是经历了那一切的人
You know, I was the one who went through it.

46
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,050
你什么时候才能不这样对我
So when are you gonna stop treating me like this?

47
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,430
我不是小孩了
I'm not a kid.

48
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,400
停止  这就停止
Just stop. Stop now.

00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,780
婚前协议

50
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,120
婚前协议

51
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,090
因为我相信他  我希望他知道这点
Because I trust him and I want him to know that.

52
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,280
他不该受这种委屈  我不会那样对他
He deserves better. I'm not gonna do that to him.

53
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,120
是啊  网络很快
I know, the network's fast,

54
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,360
但我们没有最大限度利用它的东西
but we don't have anything that maximizes it.

55
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,810
我们有辆赛车  却只在闲置着
We have this... racecar and it's just idling.

56
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,830
我们有赛道  我们需要一辆赛车
Well, we have a race track. What we need is a racecar.

57
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,890
你真的好讨厌
You're really annoying.

58
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,030
但这就将是我们的赛车
But this will be our racecar.

59
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,640
两位玩家  第一视角游戏
Two player, first person game,

60
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,750
拨号上网  在线游戏
online, over dial-up.

61
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,810
我们还得考虑清楚游戏设定
We still have to figure out what it's about.

62
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,700
是啊  我们会的
What it's about. Yeah, we will.

63
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,480
我们会想出来的
Between the two of us.

64
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,300
还有我们一流的团队
And our crack team.

65
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,490
这将是非常出色的游戏
It will be excellent game,

66
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,140
就像从可怜的小男孩手里偷面包
like steal the bread from the weak little boy.

67
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,110
我模仿得很像
It is good impersonation I do.

68
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,840
如果你是在模仿被派去杀莎拉·康纳的机器人的话
If you were impersonating the cyborg sent to kill Sarah Connor.

69
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,410
对了  那个今天发行
Oh, damn, that came out today.

70
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,560
-对啊  -嗯  我想去买
- Oh, yeah. - Yeah, I want to go pick it up.

71
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,820
我阳光海岸的朋友说好替我留一份
My friend at Suncoast was gonna reserve a copy.

72
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,840
几点了
What time is it?

73
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,950
我得走了
I gotta go.

74
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,180
我要是迟到了  我老板会骂死我的
If I'm late, my boss is gonna have my ass.

75
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,070
她听上去好可恶
Oh, she sounds like such a bitch.

76
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,940
可不是吗
Oh, you have no idea.

77
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,000
你的衣服  马上给我
Your clothes, give them to me now.

78
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,260
别闹啦
Stop with the impressions.

79
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,860
你  我  今晚看《终结者》
You, me, "Terminator," Tonight.

80
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,730
好
Okay.

81
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,910
早上好  美女
Mornin', sunshine.

82
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,810
你才回家吗
You just headin' home?

83
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,660
就回去几小时
Uh, just for a couple hours.

84
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,630
好姑娘
Attagirl.

85
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,750
好好睡一觉
Now get some shut-eye.

86
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,520
我会确保这地方离了你不会烧毁
I'll make sure the place doesn't burn down without you.

87
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,360
好吧
All right.

88
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,440
早上好
Hey, good morning.

89
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,170
熬夜了  要点咖啡吗
Long night? You want some coffee?

90
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,300
我有点想喝啤酒  是不是不太好
I kind of want a beer. Is that bad?

91
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,000
当然不会  忙了一整天  我也会想喝两杯
Hell, no. A long day at work, I'd have two.

92
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,240
-孩子们呢  -在刷牙
- Where are the girls? - They're brushing their teeth.

93
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,060
感觉太棒了
Oh, that is too good.

94
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,870
那边一切还好吧
Everything going okay over there?

95
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,740
嗯  非常棒
Yeah, it's amazing.

96
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,520
社区扩张很快
You know, Community's expanding so fast.

97
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,450
工作量很大  但是我想做的工作
It's just a lot of work, but it's work I want to be doing.

98
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,600
对了
Oh, shoot.

99
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,610
我们应该联系
You know, we need to get in touch

100
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,410
一下那边的人
with somebody over at what's it called.

101
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,810
他们还没把首张发票寄过来
They haven't sent us our first invoice

102
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,110
我们得算算账
and we need to figure out billing.

103
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,390
这个嘛
Oh, well,

104
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,560
他们肯定会发些什么过来的
I'm sure they'll probably send something over, you know?

105
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,670
嗯  我只是想把合同落到纸面上
Yeah, I just want to make sure we get this deal in writing.

106
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,660
简直像天上掉馅饼一样不真实
It seems almost too good to be true.

107
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,600
那好  那我和他谈谈
Right, well, I'll talk to him.

108
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,290
你要忙的事不少了
You know, you've got enough on your plate.

109
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,990
就是你真心想做的事
You know, stuff you actually want to be doing.

110
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,280
-嗯  -对了  我有件事想和你说说
- Yeah-- - Oh, I wanted to talk to you about this.

111
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,840
我在考虑做
I've been thinking about doing something

112
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,140
订制电脑的生意
with this made-to-order computer business.

113
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,700
是啊  挺好的
Yeah, you should.

114
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,460
怎么了
Something wrong?

115
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,090
没事  不小心呛着了
No, no, it just went down the wrong pipe.

116
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,210
话说  考虑到
You know, I think maybe with everything

117
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,560
之前索纳里斯那事
that's gone down with Sonaris and all,

118
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,040
也许我直接和他们打交道比较好
it'd be better if I could deal with them directly.

119
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,070
你了解卡梅伦  如果你插一手
You know Cameron. If I can keep you out of it,

120
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,890
她大概会对我们大发雷霆
maybe we can spare ourselves her wrath.

121
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,070
好  可以  没问题
Yeah, sure. No problem.

122
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,210
那好  能尽快安排次见面吗  比如这周
Great, so we can set something up soon? This week?

123
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,130
行
Yeah.

124
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,390
其实
You know what? Actually

125
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,250
那边在跟我接洽的人  就是乔
the person I've been dealing with over there is Joe.

126
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,610
哪个乔
Joe who?

127
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,070
别乱扔啊
Oh, come on, now.

128
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,240
躲啊
Duck!

129
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,590
天老爷  你穿的是睡衣吗
Gracious, is that a pajama top?

130
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,150
睡衣本质上是什么呢  约翰
Well, what is a pajama top, John?

131
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,970
如果你穿这身睡着了
I mean, if you fall asleep in that shirt,

132
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,900
那这就成睡衣了吗
does it become a pajama top?

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,680
所以这就不是睡衣  因为我...
And then can it ever not be a pajama top once it is--

134
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,970
我只是想问你买的时候没买配套睡裤吗
I'm just askin' when you bought it, did it come with bottoms?

135
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,080
睡裤本质上又是什么呢
What constitutes bottoms?

136
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,100
得  当我没问
Okay, forget I asked.

137
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,890
好是好  不过你知道我会说什么
Yeah, it's cool, but you know what I'm gonna say.

138
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,810
别这样  就是好人对坏人
Oh, come on. Look, it's good guys versus bad guys.

139
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:37,860
但他们为什么是坏人
Yeah, but why are they bad?

140
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,660
为什么要打他们  背景故事是什么
Why do we care? What's the context?

141
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,570
背景故...过山车就没有背景故事
Cont-- a roller coaster doesn't have any context.

142
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,220
-汤姆  -怎么  大家从过山车上下来
- Tom... - What? No one gets off Judge Roy Scream

143
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,480
才不会去谈论其典故  他们在乎的是刺激体验
talking about the story. They talk about the experience.

144
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,660
坐一趟过山车只要90秒
A roller coaster's 90 seconds long.

145
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,140
你得琢磨出
You have to create something

146
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,070
能让玩家沉迷几小时的内容来
here that's gonna consume people for hours.

147
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,880
-你知道我说得对  -卡梅伦
- You know I'm right. - Cameron?

148
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,730
我会回来的[《终结者》台词]
I'll be back.

149
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,340
老天  怎么了  你又想怎样
Oh, God. What? What do you want?

150
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,420
你也知道  我是穆特尼的老用户了
As you know, I am a long-standing Mutiny user,

151
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,280
所以我相信你会重视我的看法
so I trust you'll give my input the weight it is due.

152
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,680
-赶紧说吧  -昨天晚上
- Okay, get on with it. - Yesterday evening,

153
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,190
我在玩视差
I was playing "Parallax."

154
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,960
第8章第4关
Chapter eight, challenge four.

155
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,280
-在大道上  -怎么了
- On the path... - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

156
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,570
我把谜题解开了
I solved the riddle

157
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,550
却没办法继续走下去
and yet I wasn't able to continue on.

158
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,540
要么这是个故障
Either this is a glitch or

159
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,700
要么就是你们剧情安排出问题了
an illogical piece of in-game storytelling.

160
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,970
不管怎样  我要你们退还我这几小时的费用
Whatever the case, I would like like a refund for that hour of usage.

161
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,070
给你钱才怪  哥们
You're not getting shit, buddy.

162
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,860
我们才不会
We don't give refunds for

163
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,740
给过不了关的笨蛋玩家退钱
people who are too thick to figure out the game,

164
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,180
即使我们退费  你两个月没付账了
and even if we did, you haven't paid your bill in two months,

165
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,500
你本来就在透支游戏时间
so you're operating on borrowed time as it is.

166
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,590
如果我是你  我就会回到第8章
Now, if I were you, I'd head back to chapter eight

167
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,890
或许想想我越来越少的水储备
and maybe consider my dwindling water reserves

168
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,960
看看在游戏里什么地方能补水
and see where in the game I could've replenished my supply.

169
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,680
再见
Bye!

170
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,430
-切特吗  -对
- Chet? - Yeah.

171
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,920
但这没道理啊
But it just makes no damn sense.

172
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,890
我想要杯咖啡
I want a cup of coffee...

173
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,740
可杯子在厨房这边
Look, cups are clear across the kitchen, huh?

174
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,000
看见没  那糖在哪里呢
See? Now where's the sugar?

175
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,190
又在厨房的另一边
Again, all the way across the kitchen.

176
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,270
你看  我像弹球一样来回蹦跶
Come on, man. I'm bouncing around like a damn pinball.

177
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,500
在这里建个咖啡站  一站解决所有需求
Now, look, create a station. One-stop, all your needs.

178
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,310
你明白我在说什么吗
Do you know what I'm talking about?

179
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,660
咖啡吗
Coffee?

180
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,060
天哪
Oh, God.

181
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,340
是效率  小子  时间就是金钱
Efficiency, son. Time is money.

182
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,670
天呐...出去吧
For... get outta here.

183
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,420
你简直太棒  博斯
You're amazing, Boz.

184
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,910
刚刚烦你的人是谁
Hey, who was that bothering you?

185
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,350
是切特  他是个用户
Oh, Chet. He's a user.

186
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,740
他就是个烦人鬼
He's just some pain in the ass.

187
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,080
垂直空间呢
What about vertical space?

188
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,290
我们可以设置垂直的管道
We could have these vertical tubes

189
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,130
让你爬上爬下
that you climb up, you drop down...

190
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,810
嗯  这很棒  但你知道我会说什么
Yeah, that's amazing. But you know what I'm gonna say...

191
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,730
嗯嗯嗯  你就看看嘛
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just check it out.

192
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,650
-来看看  -那你去想吧
- Just check it out. - Well, then, figure it out.

193
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,980
你和你老婆撒谎了  这不是我的问题
You lied to your wife. That's not my problem.

194
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,790
就是你的问题  她会告诉卡梅伦的
Oh, but it is. She's gonna tell Cameron, all right?

195
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,850
她们想和一个西方集团的代表坐下谈谈
They want a sit-down with a representative from Westgroup.

196
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,440
她们要一份书面的正式合同
They want a formal agreement in writing.

197
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,900
你得把这事正规化
Look, you gotta make this thing legitimate.

198
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,060
-这不可能  -那就想办法
- That's not possible. - Well, then, make it possible.

199
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,980
这才三周
It's only been three weeks.

200
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,750
我的计划是收集数月的数据
The whole plan was to amass months of data.

201
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,930
-我们别无选择  -我们总有选择的
- We don't have a choice. - We've always got a choice.

202
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,180
我可以把穆特尼赶出网络
I can kick Mutiny off the network

203
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,270
再去另找一家在线服务提供商
and go to another online service.

204
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,210
你可以  但你不会那么做
You can, but you're not going to

205
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,220
因为我们说好的  对吗  乔
because we had a deal, right, Joe?

206
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,410
而且你会遵守约定
And you're gonna honor that agreement

207
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,110
因为你不是每个人口中说的
because you're not the reptilian son of a bitch

208
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,670
那种冷血混蛋
that everybody says you are.

209
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,930
-你已经变了  -这不是我的打算
- You're a changed man. - This isn't what I wanted.

210
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:12,960
如果我过早告诉维勒
If I tell Wheeler too early

211
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,720
而他不支持的话  整个网络就泡汤了
and he doesn't go for it, the network is done,

212
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,930
-穆特尼也完了  -别犯傻了
- Mutiny is done. - Snap out of it, all right?

213
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:17,710
你可是乔·麦克米伦
You're Joe MacMillan.

214
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,320
如果你想的话都可以撺掇他跳桥
You could talk him into jumping off a bridge if you wanted to.

215
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,820
下定决心  去做就好
Just decide to do it and do it.

216
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,480
我得走了
Look, I gotta go.

217
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,830
-向我保证你会...  -知道了
- Just promise me that you're gonna... - Got it.

218
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,480
怎么回事
What's going on?

219
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,140
我想先强调我之前完全不知情
I want to emphasize that I had no idea about this,

220
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,370
我一得知  就直接来找你了
and as soon as I found out, I came straight here.

221
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,560
怎么了
What?

222
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,140
是乔·麦克米伦在运营网络
Joe MacMillan is the person running the network.

223
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,200
他是戈登在公司的联络人
He's Gordon's contact at the company.

224
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,660
你说什么
I'm sorry?

225
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,080
戈登帮他设置了分时系统
Gordon helped him set up time-sharing.

226
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,880
以此交换穆特尼拿到优惠的合同
He insisted that Mutiny get a good deal,

227
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,200
-但他没告诉我  -打住
- and he didn't tell me... - Stop.

228
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,360
你把乔·麦克米伦放进门来了
You let Joe MacMillan in the door?

229
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,450
我什么都没做
I didn't do anything.

230
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,350
是啊  又是戈登
No, Gordon, again.

231
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,730
-抱歉唐娜  但他不在这里工作  -我知道
- I'm sorry, Donna, but he doesn't work here. - I know.

232
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,940
-我们的事轮不到他管  -我知道
- This isn't his to mess with. - I know.

233
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,960
他想补偿搞垮网络的那事
He wanted to make up for crashing the network.

234
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,940
好个道歉的方式
What a way to apologize.

235
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,390
他很惭愧  所以想弥补
He felt terrible. He wanted to fix it.

236
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,820
我知道这不算安慰
I know this isn't any consolation,

237
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,450
但我见过乔  他看起来...不一样了
but I sat across from Joe. He seems... different.

238
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,300
或许他变了
Maybe he's changed.

239
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,800
谢谢你的坦诚
Thank you for your honesty.

240
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,000
如果你不介意  我想自己待会儿
If you don't mind, I'd like a few moments to myself.

241
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,660
好
Okay.

242
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,960
从上次的检测来看
Um, based on my examination last time--

243
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,440
你手的平衡失调
the symmetrical weakness in your hands,

244
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,060
以及记忆力和注意力的测试
the memory and concentration tests,

245
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,970
加之你的工作经历  你曾在铅焊料环境中工作
your employment history, um, exposure to lead solder,

246
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,220
使用过有机溶剂  我给你做了核磁共振
and working with solvents-- I ordered the MRI.

247
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,940
我知道你不太喜欢做这项检测
I know you were a little ambivalent about the test,

248
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,160
但我很高兴我们还是做了
but I am glad that we sprung for it

249
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,480
因为它真是个很棒的新工具
because it really is an amazing new tool.

250
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,790
据放射科医生说  有两个区域
According to the radiologists, there are two areas,

251
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,700
非常小的区域  有萎缩迹象
very small, that show signs of atrophy.

252
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:28,960
萎缩
Atrophy?

253
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,000
脑损伤
Brain damage.

254
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,290
叫做慢性中毒性脑病
It's chronic toxic encephalopathy.

255
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,100
根据各种现象综合来看
Now, given this combination of clues,

256
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,920
这能解释你的身体症状
it explains your physical symptoms

257
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,040
也很可能造成了你跟我描述的
and it likely accounts for the psychological symptoms

258
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,480
心理问题
you described to me as well--

259
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,700
你的易怒和情绪波动
irritability and the mood swings.

260
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,300
好吧  那要怎么解决
Yeah, how do I fix it?

261
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,830
我很遗憾  没有治疗方法
I'm sorry to say there is no treatment.

262
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,290
脑组织无法自我修复
Brain tissue does not repair itself.

263
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,400
这个病将是永久性的
This will be a permanent condition.

264
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,690
但我觉得没事
But I feel fine.

265
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,630
今后会发生什么
What the hell's gonna happen now?

266
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,140
你的症状可能会加重
Well, your symptoms could likely progress.

267
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,770
-还会加重吗  -这是多年间
- This could get worse? - This was years of

268
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,340
毒素在你血液中渐渐积累的结果
slow accumulation of these toxins in your blood.

269
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,610
但鉴于此  你的症状如今加速显现出来
But in light of that, the fact that your symptoms have accelerated

270
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,940
说明你可能
would indicate that

271
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,610
还没有到最糟糕的状态
you likely haven't seen the worst of this yet.

272
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,140
我很抱歉  戈登
I am sorry, Gordon.

273
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,100
卡梅伦怎么了
So, what's going on with Cameron?

274
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,370
你记得乔·麦克米伦吗
Do you remember Joe MacMillan?

275
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,590
-记得啊  眉毛将军  -什么
- Sure, Admiral Eyebrows. - What?

276
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,370
我们这么叫他  你不这么叫吗
That's what we called him. You didn't call him that?

277
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,060
以前不  但以后会了
No, but I will now.

278
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,570
总之  原来他是网络的运营商
Anyway, turns out he's the one who's running the network.

279
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,440
真糟  她为了躲那个疯子  才搞了叛乱[穆特尼]
That sucks. She mutinied to get away from that psycho.

280
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,260
你跟谁聊天呢  莱夫
Who are you talking to, Lev?

281
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,930
没谁
Nobody.

282
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,360
不关你的事  就是个朋友
It's none of your business. It's just a friend.

283
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,550
你在跟谁聊天  莱夫
Who you talking to, Lev?

284
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,570
就是我在社区里认识的一个人
It's just a guy I met in one of the forums.

285
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,670
我们一直在聊  他喜欢治疗乐队[英国乐队]
We've-- we've been talking. He likes the Cure.

286
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,990
-你在跟他调情  -那又怎样
- You've been flirting. - So?

287
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,570
莱夫  这很好  非常好
Lev, this is good. This is really good.

288
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,710
我们要做一个可以在网上认识人的聊天室
We're gonna make a room where you can meet people online.

289
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,720
-认识  -对
- Meet? - Yes.

290
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,200
-姑娘吗  -对
- Like girls? - Yes!

291
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,110
我们做一个交友聊天室  让大家结识
We'll do a personals room where you meet

292
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,600
然后再进入私密聊天室  像约会一样
and then you go into a private room, like a date.

293
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,800
是莱夫给了她灵感
She got the idea from Lev

294
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,450
因为他一直在网上跟人聊天
'cause he's been talking to someone online.

295
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,420
这可好
Oh, great.

296
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,880
我还一直活在过去呢
You see, I've been living in the past,

297
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,290
按照传统  带女人出去吃饭
taking a woman out to dinner like we used to do.

298
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,250
-你有约会呀  博斯  -真不明白
- You got a date, Boz? - Now, I'm not sure

299
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,410
你们为什么对此这么震惊又怀疑
why that news is met with such shock and disbelief.

300
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,450
你看来是在跟男孩子聊天呢  莱夫
Looks like you're talking to a fella there, Lev.

301
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,570
是啊
Yeah.

302
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,400
这样啊  好吧
Yeah, okay.

303
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,230
原来你是
No, so you're...

304
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,700
没事  这完全...好吧
no, that's completely, uh... yeah.

305
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,560
我有个亲戚也是
Oh, hell, I got a cousin.

306
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,970
很好
Good.

307
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,370
我得再来杯咖啡
I'm gonna get another coffee here.

308
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,280
-嗯  -唐娜  戈登找你
- Yeah. - Hey, Donna, it's Gordon!

309
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:12,950
喂
Hello?

310
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,880
-亲爱的  -什么事
- Hey, sweetie. - What's up?

311
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,980
-我... -我们给私人聊天室起什么名
- I was, uh... - What are we gonna call the private rooms?

312
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,760
不知道  双人小桌
I don't know, A Table For Two?

313
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,840
-好恶  -那你自己想吧
- Barf. - Okay, fine, then you figure it out.

314
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,440
抱歉  你说什么
Sorry, what were you saying?

315
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,040
你在哪  周围好吵
Where are you? It's loud.

316
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,580
我...刚开了电视
I've, uh... I just got the TV on.

317
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,970
今晚出来怎么样  就我们俩
Why don't we go out tonight, just the two of us?

318
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,030
不带孩子
No kids?

319
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,280
我们好久没
It's been a while since

320
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,160
享受二人世界了
we spent some time together just you and me.

321
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,030
-唐娜  -抱歉我走神了
- Donna? - Yeah, sorry. I lost you for a second.

322
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,790
主意不错  可是我们刚有个新点子
That sounds great. We just really hit on something

323
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,090
可能会工作到很晚  所以
and I think we're probably gonna be working late, so...

324
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,790
能理解
Yeah, yeah, of course.

325
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,970
那这周末可以吗
Um, but maybe this weekend sometime?

326
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,140
-当然  -抱歉  我要去干活儿了
- Sure. - Sorry, look, I gotta jump off,

327
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,470
回家见
but I'll see you at home, okay?

328
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,430
-爱你  再见  -我也爱...
- I love you, bye. - Yeah, yeah, I love you t...

329
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,280
汤姆  走吗
Hey, Tom, you coming?

330
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,830
-不错哦  -我要副驾
- Sounds cool. - Shotgun.

331
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,690
-嗯  -烦人
- Yeah. - Aw, man!

332
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,720
你知不知道她怎么了
Hey, um, do you know what's going on with her?

333
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,260
-卡梅伦  -前任的烦心事
- With Cameron? - Stuff with her ex.

334
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,740
一言难尽
It's a long story.

335
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,090
走吧  出发啦
Come on, let's go.

336
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,620
-狗子快冲  -你才狗呢
- Come on, sobachka. - You dog.

337
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,580
钥匙带上
Grab my keys!

338
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,480
{\an8}终结者

339
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,360
{\an8}终结者

340
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,440
{\an8}终结者

341
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,340
卡梅
Hey, Cam.

342
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:35,960
干什么呢
What's shakin'?

343
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,100
天呐  破椅子
Oh, Jesus! This stupid chair.

344
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,630
卡梅
Hey, Cam?

345
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,080
-卡梅  -什么事
- Cam? - What?

346
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,010
咱俩谈谈
Come on, let's talk.

347
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,040
我计算了
I've calculated the cost

348
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,440
你抽出来每桶石油的成本
of every barrel of oil you pull out of the ground.

349
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,960
最开始的盈利需要很多投入
It takes an awful lot of money to make that first dollar.

350
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,820
用现有的主机提供分时服务
Using your existing mainframe for time-sharing,

351
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,040
就不需要你支出
there's no cost to you.

352
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,500
这一整片汪洋都是银子
There's an ocean of money out there

353
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,630
而你已经钻了井
and you have already drilled the wells.

354
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,070
大家谈论起计算机革命
People talk about the computer revolution

355
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,700
好像这都过去了
as if it were a thing of the past,

356
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,910
可我从小就围着IBM
but I grew up running around IBM.

357
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,880
这一行深入我的血液
This business is in my blood,

358
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,280
相信我
and believe me when I tell you,

359
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,830
这场革命还没开始
the revolution hasn't even started yet.

360
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,970
这听起来
I think it sounds...

361
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,440
挺有前途
promising.

362
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,730
我就知道你会理解
I thought you would.

363
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,140
所以三周前我就开干了
That's why I did it three weeks ago.

364
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,980
我改进了主机
I retrofitted the mainframe.

365
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,130
把网络租给了一家新兴公司穆特尼  
I sold the time to an exciting company called Mutiny.

366
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,300
仅三周  它们就呈现了稳定的增长
In three weeks, they've shown steady growth

367
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,480
而且还会继续扩张
and will only continue to expand.

368
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:48,080
这或许能成为西方集团放弃挖掘过去
This could be the moment when Westgroup stops digging in the past

369
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,630
开始打造未来的时刻
and starts building the future.

370
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,400
而你...什么都不用做
All you have to do... is nothing.

371
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,720
三周的数据  这不算什么
Three weeks of data, that's not much.

372
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,260
-但趋势大好  -也许吧  坐下  乔
- The trend will continue. - Maybe. Have a seat, Joe.

373
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,290
这都是你背着我干的
So, you did all this behind my back.

374
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,060
不小的赌博啊
That was quite a gamble.

375
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,050
西方集团规模巨大
You know, Westgroup is a huge operation.

376
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,470
但是  这种大规模公司
However, one resource sorely lacking

377
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,260
唯一紧缺的资源  就是动力
in a company of this size is hunger.

378
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,400
这里的人都满足而开心
Everybody here is fat and happy.

379
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,190
但你呢
But you?

380
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,690
我觉得你是那种永不满足的人
You strike me as the kind of guy that isn't ever satisfied.

381
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,440
你不开心  这是能生钱的
You aren't happy, and I can turn that into money.

382
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,350
这样一来  你就要离开数据录入部了吧
I assume this takes you out of Data Entry.

383
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,060
是的  我要当网络主管
It would. I would be the network administrator

384
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,310
主管网络出租  还有硬件维护
managing the sales of the time, the hardware upkeep.

385
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,120
新头衔是不是也要涨薪
And I suppose a nice raise comes along with a new title.

386
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,350
不用  先让我向你证明这能成功再说
No raise. Let me show you that it works first.

387
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,110
这些莎拉都知道吗
Sara knew all about this, huh?

388
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,430
居然完全瞒过了我
She's got some poker face.

389
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:57,800
是啊
Yeah.

390
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,840
我想先见见他们公司的人
I just want to have a meeting with somebody from,

391
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,820
叫什么来着  穆特尼
what was it? Mutiny?

392
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,870
明晚就安排个见面吧
Let's have a sit-down tomorrow night.

393
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,230
我7点要飞去阿拉斯加  走前见个面
I'm flying up to Alaska around 7:00, but we can meet before then.

394
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,690
这不用你担心  客户我可以应酬
Uh, you don't have to worry. I can handle the client.

395
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,430
我没担心  明晚见面
Oh, I'm not worried. We'll meet tomorrow night.

396
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,510
想和我做生意的人
I never go into business with anyone

397
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,490
我都要先见一面
without looking them in the eye first.

398
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,030
我想杀了他
Well, I want to kill him.

399
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,120
我知道你不喜欢乔  我也是
I know you don't like Joe. Neither do I.

400
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,190
我也想看他倒霉
I'd like to see him punched in the balls as much as anybody,

401
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,290
但他是个生意人  而且做得不赖
but he's a businessman, and not a bad one.

402
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,700
搞出了巨人  还拉我入伙了
Put together Giant, got me onboard.

403
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,680
那倒霉盒子就是场灾难
That box was an abomination.

404
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,470
严格从商业角度来看
From a strictly commercial standpoint,

405
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,030
当时撤出你的系统是正确的做法
pulling your operating system was the right move.

406
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,150
那台机器  对我意义重大
That machine, it meant a lot to me.

407
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,780
虽然称不上艺术  但确实是好商品
It wasn't art, but it was sound business,

408
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,690
穆特尼的问题就在于
and one thing about Mutiny is

409
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,090
太艺术  但缺乏商业性
you got a whole lot of the former, not much of the latter.

410
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,120
再说了  现在他做的也正是你想要的
Look, to top it all off, you got Joe right where you want him.

411
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,180
不是吗
You kidding me?

412
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:59,180
他想要求你原谅  想要弥补你
He wants forgiveness. He wants to do right by you.

413
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,050
我只是觉得我们又陷入了他的什么计划
I just feel like we're part of some plan that he has.

414
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,060
唯一一个我相信
The only person I trust to get

415
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,380
能看清乔·麦克米伦的人  就是你
an accurate read on Joe MacMillan-- that's you.

416
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,970
你得去看清他的想法
You gotta look him in the eye.

417
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,910
如果我不满意我看到的呢
And if I don't like what I see?

418
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,870
那你就杀了他
Then you kill him.

419
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,350
笑一个
Smile!

420
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,870
笑一个
Smile!

421
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,550
你为什么不跳舞
Why aren't you dancing?

422
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,470
我有脑损伤
I have brain damage!

423
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,810
没听说过
Oh, never heard of them.

424
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,270
我觉得我要死了
I think I'm dying!

425
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,530
我也是
Oh, me, too!

426
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,080
你为什么不在之前告诉我
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

427
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,570
以防万一不成功
In case it didn't work out.

428
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,450
我不想让你看到我失败
I didn't want to fall on my face in front of you.

429
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,670
话说你是怎么做到的啊
How did you even do it?

430
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,260
戈登帮我设置了系统
Gordon helped me with the setup.

431
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,230
他改装了一部分机器
He did some of the hardware

432
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,540
作为交换  我得把网租给唐娜的公司
on the condition that I lease the time to the company where Donna works.

433
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,260
他们需要低廉的价格
They need a competitive price.

434
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,750
卡梅伦的公司
Cameron's company.

435
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,730
越来越复杂了
The plot thickens.

436
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,370
这是戈登的要求
It was Gordon's stipulation.

437
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,410
你知道我会怎么看
You know how this looks.

438
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,780
-是啊  -很糟
- Yeah. - Bad.

439
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,340
这很糟
It looks bad.

440
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,110
我想告诉你的
I would've told you,

441
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,290
但我又想给你看成果
but I wanted to show you the finished product.

442
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:42,100
的确很傻  但我以为你会觉得我很厉害
It was stupid, but I thought you'd be impressed.

443
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,230
你确实厉害
I am.

444
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,650
我们不要有秘密
We don't keep secrets.

445
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,900
不管多小的秘密  我受不了
I don't care how small. I can't do it.

446
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,880
-早  -早
- Morning. - Morning.

447
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,300
乔  你好啊
Joe, lovely to see you.

448
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,260
唐娜在家吗
Is Donna home?

449
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,650
我不知道你跟她谈是不是个好主意
I'm not sure you really want to talk to her.

450
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,010
唐娜她...
Donna doesn't, uh--

451
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,300
我不知道该怎么说  她不喜欢你
I don't know how to put this-- like you.

452
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,850
唐娜不喜欢你
Donna does not like you.

453
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,990
我得跟她谈谈
I need to speak to her.

454
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,220
好吧
Okay.

455
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,170
戈登  谁来了
Gordon, who was that?

456
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,060
找你的
It's for you.

457
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,190
我安排了你跟雅各布·维勒的会面
I've set up a meeting with Jacob Wheeler.

458
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,150
他想跟你坐下来聊聊
He's looking forward to sitting down with you.

459
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,360
-指名道姓找我吗  -穆特尼的代表
- Me specifically? - A representative from Mutiny.

460
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,830
你是搞硬件的
I thought you were the obvious choice

461
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,340
显然是最佳人选
given your hardware background.

462
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,790
而且我不是卡梅伦
And because I'm not Cameron.

463
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:47,330
她的话确实有点尴尬  但这不是我来找你的原因
That would be a little awkward, but that's not why I'm here.

464
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,930
乔  这不是我的公司  你得跟她说
Look, Joe, it's not my company. You need to deal with her.

465
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,710
她得做好准备
I expect her to be prepared

466
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,760
并且能公事公办
and I expect her to be professional.

467
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,460
这也事关穆特尼的未来
It's Mutiny's future on the line here, too.

468
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,230
告诉我时间地点  我保证她会过去
You tell me where and when, I'll make sure she shows up.

469
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,610
我昨晚没听见你回家
I didn't hear you come home last night.

470
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,170
我把乔的事告诉了卡梅伦  她大发脾气
Cameron flipped when I told her about Joe.

471
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,980
我只好留下主持局面
I had to stay and hold down the fort.

472
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,370
想吃点午饭吗
Do you want to get some lunch?

473
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,630
也许我们可以一起去接孩子
Maybe we could go pick up the girls together.

474
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,090
你知道我现在忙得多焦头烂额
You know I'm dealing with a lot of stuff right now.

475
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,210
我得回去上班
I-- I have to go back to work.

476
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,940
还得再去跟卡梅伦谈
I have to talk to Cameron, again.

477
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,360
抱歉
I'm sorry.

478
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,110
我想先跟你说两句...
I'd like to say a few things before--

479
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,640
他们准备好见我们了吗
Hi, are they ready for us?

480
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,800
稍等片刻
One moment, please.

481
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,610
硬件战争已经结束
The hardware wars are over.

482
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,310
未来属于联络交流
The future is in connection.

483
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,930
穆特尼拥有数款尖端游戏
Mutiny has cutting edge games,

484
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,330
玩家可以在虚拟世界中结识  对抗
people meeting and competing in a virtual world.

485
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,870
{\pos(202.5,178.495)}{\an8}韦恩·格雷茨基

486
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,510
据我所知  游戏星球
Sounds like Playnet is doing the same thing,

487
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,530
也在做同样的事
as far as I can tell.

488
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,430
-不  -不
- No. - No?

489
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,690
我们提供的是全面的交互体验
We create a fully interactive experience.

490
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,780
他们只是猜词游戏做得不错
They make a pretty good version of hangman.

491
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,850
我们和游戏星球不一样
We're not doing the same thing as Playnet.

492
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,530
也不想跟他们一样
We don't want to do the same thing as Playnet.

493
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:36,860
我们在用他们一半的资源做更好的游戏
We're doing something much, much better with half the resources.

494
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,220
-如何实现的  -我们的代码更优化
- And how do you pull that off? - Our code's better.

495
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,420
效率更高  更有创意
It's more efficient and creative.

496
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,780
告诉我  这种事要怎么能做得好
So, tell me, how does someone get good at something like that?

497
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,040
格雷茨基又是怎么打好冰球的
How did Gretzky get good at hockey?

498
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,980
-练习  -还有呢

499
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,540
上天赐予的天赋
And a whole lot of God-given talent.

500
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,940
这可是你说的
It's your words, not mine.

501
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,960
我给你看看吧
Here, let me show you.

502
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,330
没想到你会是冰球迷
I didn't make you for a hockey fan.

503
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,010
我喜欢看打架
I like the fights.

504
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,580
这只是一张演示盘
So this is just a demo disk,

505
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,330
但能让你大概知道
but it'll give you some idea

506
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,310
我们的界面是什么样
of what our interface looks like.

507
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,170
好
Okay.

508

-学校怎么样  -挺好的
- How was school? - Good.

509

是吗
Yeah?

510
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,170
想跟爸爸去一起玩吗
You guys wanna go have some fun with your dad?

511
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,670
什么意思
What do you mean?

512
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,000
你们想吧
I don't know. You tell me.

513
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,910
你想做什么都行
We can do anything you want.

514
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,780
我们去外公外婆家

516
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,660
你们没听明白  我们做什么都可以

可以去看电影
we could go to the movies, you know?

519
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:44,880
你们随便说

520
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,140
我们去外公外婆家吧

525
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,690
当然
Of course!

526
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,470
多谢了  我跟她们说去哪都行
I appreciate it. You know, I asked them where they wanted to go,

527
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,450
做什么都可以的
do whatever they want.

528

她们完全迷上了
They are positively obsessed

给了他一台游戏厅的电子游戏

Hey, sweethearts, what is that contraption called?

535
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,320
-任天堂  -任天堂
- A Nintendo! - Nintendo!

536
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,910
就是一群小人打乌龟还是什么的
It's a bunch of little men fighting turtles or something.

537
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,280
我根本看不懂  真不知有什么好的
I don't-- can't follow it. I don't understand the appeal.

538
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,930
要喝点什么吗
Um, can I offer you a drink?

539
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,080
当然
Sure.

541
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,210
不错啊
I'm impressed.

542
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,090
他怎么样呢
So what about this guy?

543
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:54,170
你们在卡迪夫电子工作时认识的  是吗
You two know each other from your stint at Cardiff Electric, right?

544
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,560
你能替他做担保吗  他要娶我女儿了
Can you vouch for him? He's marrying my daughter.

545
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,470

恭喜
Congratulations.

我只想说  你刚刚表现很棒

很高兴能再见到你
and it was nice to see you.

550
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,540
我听说你耍伎俩
You know, when I heard that you had weaseled

551
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,230
回到我生活中来时  我很生气
your way back into my life, I was pissed.

552
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,330
但更多是害怕
But more than that, I was scared

553
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,370
因为我以为我是你的目标
because I thought I was the mark.

554
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,780
他才是  对吗
He's the mark, isn't he?

555
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,440
他不是目标  我不...
He's not a mark. I don't--

556
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,770
这是个实在的生意提议
it's an honest business proposal.

557
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,810
我分不出你是不是知道自己在撒谎
I can't tell if you know you're lying or not.

558
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:56,230
-我没撒谎  -好吧
- I'm not lying. - Okay.

559
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,640
那么你爱上了
So it's just a coincidence that

560
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,670
一个亿万富翁的女儿只是巧合喽
you fell in love with the daughter of a billionaire.

561
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,670
你为什么不明白我是在帮你
Why can't you see that I'm helping you here?

562
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,460
我没叫你帮忙啊
I never asked for help.

563
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,920
我不需要帮忙  尤其不需要你帮
I don't want any help, especially from you.

564
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:09,910
听我说  我们分别之后  发生了很多改变
Listen, a lot has changed since I saw you last.

565
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:13,480
是啊  我不再是那个天真的女孩了
Yeah, I'm not the same naive girl anymore.

566
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,770
离我远点
So just stay away.

567
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,170
你收到我的信了吗
Did you get my letter?

568
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,180
你读了吗
Did you read it?

569
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:26,880
你就是卡梅伦吧
You must be Cameron.

570
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,930
抱歉  卡梅伦  这是莎拉
Oh, sorry. Cameron, this is Sara.

571
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:29,980
莎拉  这是卡梅伦
Sara, this is Cameron.

572
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,500
-你未婚妻  当然了  -是啊
- The fiancé, of course. - Yeah.

573
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,660
-恭喜  -谢谢
- Congrats. - Thank you.

574
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:38,930
乔跟我说了你的公司  真有意思
Uh, Joe told me all about your company. It's very interesting.

575
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,430
我们该一起吃个晚餐
We should all have dinner.

576
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,560
我很想多了解一下
I'd love to learn more about it.

577
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,340
一定的
We'll have to make that happen.

578
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,850
认识你很高兴
Uh, it was lovely to meet you.

579
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,640
乔  很高兴
Joe, always a pleasure.

580
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,650
-一切还好吧  -嗯
- Everything okay? - Yeah.

581
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,350
嗯  很好
Yeah, it was great.

582
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,330
看出来了
Clearly.

583
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,600
你真逗  戈登
You're fun, Gordon.

584
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,510
我以前怎么没发现
How come I never knew you were so much fun?

585
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,820
我是很逗  非常逗
I am fun. I'm super fun.

586
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,330
是唐娜拖我后腿了
It's that Donna that keeps me down.

587
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,940
她是随她爸
She takes after her dad.

588
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,030
我们以前多快乐啊
God, me and her used to have such a good time together.

589
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,650
我们刚在一起的时候  来看你们
You know, when we first got together and we'd come visit you guys,

590
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:33,220
最后总是去一家酒吧/俱乐部  叫转折
we'd always end up at this bar/club type place, the Twist,

591
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,800
我们一直跳舞到挪不动步
and we would dance till we were just about dead.

592
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,070
简直完爆全场
You know, shut the place down.

593
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,140
-我家唐娜吗  -是啊
- My Donna? - Oh, yeah.

594
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,130
我们搬来的时候
I mean, when we moved here,

595
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,560
我们以为我们会经常去那儿呢
we thought we'd be going there all the time,

596
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,190
但后来  有了孩子了嘛
but, you know, the kids and, you know,

597
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:50,660
生活忙起来  就忘了找乐子了
life gets in the way and you just forget to have fun.

598
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,880
但玩乐也是很重要的
But, you know, fun's important.

599
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,240
-敬玩乐  -敬玩乐
- To fun. - To fun.

600
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,620
知道吗
You know...

601
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,610
我一直没好好感谢你
I never really thanked you properly.

602
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,470
你和盖瑞对我们太好了
You and Gary have been so good to us.

603
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,030
做了那么多
You know, done so much.

604
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,190
我们好久才站稳脚跟
It took us a while to land on our feet,

605
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,300
但你们一直支持我们
but you supported us throughout.

606
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,560
现在总算有回报了
You know, and now it's finally paid off.

607
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,490
苏珊  没有你我们做不到的
Susan, we couldn't have done it without you.

608
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,920
有钱不帮你爱的人
Well, what's the point of having money

609
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,410
还有什么意义呢
if not to help out your loved ones?

610
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,590
我不是指钱
Well, I don't mean the money.

611
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,960
就是  你们的支持
I just mean, you know, being there for us.

612
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,120
嗯
Yeah.

613
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,910
你希望我还钱吗
Well, what, you want me to pay you back?

614
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,300
我以为...
I thought that's what--

615
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,780
抱歉  这下我不好意思了
I'm sorry, I feel awkward.

616
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,580
你确实希望我还钱吗
Oh, you want me to pay you back?

617
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,470
是你说到家庭和支持
Well, all that talk of family and support

618
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,240
而且你们现在有钱了
and you having money now,

619
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,420
我就是...
I just...

620
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,630
我觉得你喝得有点多了  亲爱的
I think you've had too much to drink, sweetheart.

621
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,160
不不
Oh, no, no, no.

622
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,050
我们欠你们多少钱
What do we owe you?

623
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,630
唐娜永远不欠我们什么
Donna will never owe us a cent.

624
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,040
但是交响乐
But the Symphonic?

625
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:20,580
我们总共投入了2.2万多
We put in just north of 22,000, all told.

626
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,210
我带支票簿了
I got my checkbook.

627
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:30,860
你说2.2万多
Uh, just north of 22, 000, you say.

628
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,820
那就写2.3万吧
Why don't we make it an even 23?

629
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,360
我和我闺蜜
You know, my girlfriends and I

630
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,330
我们去试酒  那种事你也知道的
we went on a wine tasting, and you know how that is.

631
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,280
自然而然就发生了
One thing leads to another.

632
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,440
怎么了  什么罪名
What? What was the charge?

633
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,920
不当露体
Indecent exposure.

634
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,430
天呐
Oh, my God.

635
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,810
我简直震惊了
I'm absolutely scandalized.

636
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,650
抱歉  先生  能跟您说句话吗
I'm sorry, sir. Can I speak to you a moment?

637
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,130
当然
Yeah, sure.

638
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:06,820
就回来
Just one moment.

639
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,320
抱歉  先生  您的卡被拒了
I'm sorry, sir. Your card is declined.

640
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,290
被拒
Declined?

641
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,950
-把经理找来  -我就是
- Let me talk to the manager. - I am the manager.

642
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,290
我以前总来这儿的
Look, I used to come here all the time.

643
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:26,760
-我跟西尔维奥是朋友  -他退休了
- I'm friends with Silvio. - He retired.

644
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,680
我能付得起的
Look, I'm good for it.

645
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,940
我明天一早就来
I'll be here first thing tomorrow

646
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,730
拿着厚厚一叠钱  给你很多小费
with a fat wad of cash and a hefty tip.

647
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,180
我保证
You have my word.

648
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,520
-不能让她付钱吗  -当然不能
- Well, can't she pay? - No, she cannot pay.

649
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,250
-她是我的女伴  -得了  这都1985年了
- She is my date. - Come on, man. It's 1985.

650
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,450
拜托
Come on.

651
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,420
给我点时间想办法  好吗
Give me a second to work something out, all right?

652
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,630
好吧
All right.

653
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,860
伙计们  切特在用别人的账户登录聊天室
Guys, Chet's entering rooms through other people's accounts

654
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,860
还大骂博斯沃思把他踢出网络
and he's cursing out Bosworth for kicking him off the network.

655
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,580
逗死了
It's hilarious.

656
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,240
穆特尼
Mutiny.

657
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,460
-给  -谢谢
- Here. - Thank you.

658
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,910
-嗯  -我回头还你
- Yeah. - I'll pay you back.

659
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:52,930
嗯  没事  回头见
Yeah, that's cool. I'll see you a little later.

660
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,850
新椅子怎么样
How'd you like your new chair?

661
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,730
你把切特踢出网络了吗
Did you kick Chet off the network?

662
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,580
是啊
Yeah.

663
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,520
为什么啊
Why did you do that?

664
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:12,020
他欠费了  付不起钱
He was in arrears. He couldn't pay.

665
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,240
你最该同情他了
I think you'd have some sympathy for that.

666
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:18,150
该死  卡梅伦  拜托  你懂我什么意思
Oh, shit, Cameron, come on, you know what I mean.

667
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,540
是你说他烦人的  这是生意
You said he was a pain in the ass. It's a business.

668
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,910
不  这是个社区
No, it's a community.

669
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,670
我的社区
It's my community.

670
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,810
我们不能随便踢人
And we don't kick people out.

671
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:28,960
这会让人有想法
It sends a message, okay?

672
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,480
他从一开始就是忠实用户
He's been with us since day one. He's loyal.

673
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,950
是啊  他是烦人  但我喜欢他烦我
Yeah, he's a pain in the ass, but I like being annoyed by him

674
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,840
我喜欢我的破椅子
and I like my shitty chair.

675
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:44,430
我是希望...别人都别来插手穆特尼
I just... want everyone to leave Mutiny alone.

676
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,720
它是我的
It's mine.

677
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,770
喂
Hello?

678
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,360
是亨利假阳具之家吗
Is this Henry's House of Dildos?

679
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,650
克拉克先生啊
Ah, yes, Mr. Clark.

680
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:11,460
您订购的超小安全套刚刚到货
Your order of extra small condoms just arrived.

681
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,730
你好吗  汉克
How are you, Hank?

682
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,100
挺好的  伙计  你怎么样
I'm good, buddy. How are you?

683
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,500
还行吧  孩子们怎么样
I'm gettin' by. How are the kids?

684
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,310
臭熏熏  脏兮兮  还顶嘴
They smell terrible, they're filthy, they talk back.

685
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,370
简直待不下去
It's no way to live.

686
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,380
我的女儿是天使
Yeah, well, I got a couple of angels.

687
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,260
-长得像妈妈  -谢天谢地
- Got their mother's looks. - Yeah, thank God for that.

688
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,910
什么事啊  就打来烦我的吗
So, what's up? You just calling to bust some balls or what?

689
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,510
我想去看看你
Well, I was thinking about visiting,

690
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,010
带着我女儿去
you know, bringing the girls.

691
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,140
好啊
That's a great idea.

692
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,480
爸爸妈妈肯定也想见你
I'm sure Mom and Dad would like to see you, too,

693
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,140
如果你乐意开车过去的话
if you want to make the drive over there.

694
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,220
你真希望我过去吗
You really want me to come?

695
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,300
你不是随便说说的
You're not just saying that?

696
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,880
别傻了  我当然欢迎你来
Don't be stupid. Of course I do.

697
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,720
我想死你了  戈登
I miss the hell outta you, Gordo.

698
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,160
聊聊天  叙叙旧  会很棒的
Yeah, it'd be great to talk, catch up.

699
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,210
是啊  一定的
Yeah. Yeah, it would be.

700
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,810
约会怎么样
How was your date?

701
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,520
不怎么样
I've had better.

702
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,490
天呐
God.

703
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,850
我觉得你该跟卡梅伦谈谈
You know, I think you should talk to Cameron.

704
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,780
我觉得她现在有烦心事
I think she's going through some stuff right now

705
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,690
而你能帮上她
I think you could help her with.

706
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,160
什么意思
What do mean?

707
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,250
虽然不管我的事  但我觉得她可能怀孕了
None of my damn business, but I think she might be pregnant.

708
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,850
你为什么会这么想
Uh, why do you think that?

709
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,400
我在后面垃圾桶里发现一个测孕装备
I found a pregnancy kit in the trash out back.

710
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,910
我也不清楚
I don't know.

711
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,380
嗯
Yeah.

712
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,690
不
No, I...

713
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,660
那不是卡梅伦的
it wasn't Cameron's.

714
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,300
恭喜
Congratulations.

715
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,300
谢谢
Thanks.

716
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,610
机器人不会疼
Cyborgs don't feel pain.

717
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:38,960
我会疼
I do.

718
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,830
别再那么做了
Don't do that again.

719
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:44,730
-放开我  -听着  听明白了
- Just let me go. - Listen and understand!

720
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:47,240
终结者还活着
That Terminator is out there.

721
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:51,510
你没法跟它商量  没法跟它说理
It can't be bargained with, it can't be reasoned with...

722
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,380
-伙计  坐下  -它没有同情心
- Dude, sit down. - ...it doesn't feel pity...

723
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,820
-闪开  -不会感到悔恨  或恐惧
- Move. - or remorse, or fear.

724
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,450
更不会停手
And it absolutely will not stop, ever...

725
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:01,420
-博迪  让开啊  -直到它杀了你
- Brodie, get out of the way! - ...until you are dead!

726
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,620
好诶
Yeah!

727
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,110
好了  我得走了
All right, I gotta go.

728
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,200
-你去哪  -得走了
- Where you goin'? - Gotta go?

729
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,490
我有约会
I have a date.

730
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,470
而且不是在社区聊天室里
And not in a Community room,

731
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:15,560
是跟真实  活生生的女人
but with an actual living, breathing woman.

732
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,000
明天见了
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

733
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,640
真棒
Yeah, do it!

734
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,970
玩得开心
Have fun.

735
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,270
看最后一页
Turn to the last page.

736
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:47,020
-为什么  -看最后一页
- Why? - Just turn to the last page.

737
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:54,330
乔·麦克米伦

738
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:54,950
乔·麦克米伦

739
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,490
乔·麦克米伦

740
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,630
我只想要你
The only thing I'm after is you.

741
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,350
我觉得我们该放慢脚步
I think we need to slow things down.

742
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,570
我觉得这一切太快了
I think it's all going too fast.

743
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:25,150
我需要点空间想想清楚
I just need some room to figure it out.

744
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,770
-是因为卡梅伦吗  -不  是因为你
- Is this about Cameron? - No, it's about you.

745
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,810
或许也是因为我
And maybe it's about me, too.

746
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:33,960
我说不清
I don't know.

747
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,650
-我就是需要点时间  -时间  那是什么意思
- I just need some time. - Time? What does that mean?

748
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,850
-我要回奥斯汀  -多久
- I'm going back to Austin. - For how long?

749
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,820
我不知道
I don't know.

750
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,130
对不起
I'm sorry.

751
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,680
就该这么开始
This is how it should start.

752
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,490
让玩家从通风井什么的爬进去
You should have to crawl through a ventilation shaft or something.

753
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,960
我觉得他们信了
I think they bought it.

754
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,750
怎么了
What's wrong?

755
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,960
没事
Nothing.

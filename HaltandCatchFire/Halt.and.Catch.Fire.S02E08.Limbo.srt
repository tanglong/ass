Joe told me they were gonna mess with it, with Mutiny.

35
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,810
-这回你倒相信他了  -对  我信
- And now you decide to believe him? - Yeah, I do.

36
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,680
他说的是实话  我看得出来
He was telling the truth. I could tell.

37
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,840
我就是看得出来
I just could.

38
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,240
-怎么  你生气了吗  -太对了
- What, are you mad? - Yeah, I am.

39
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,920
我想卖掉公司  顺便告诉你不止我这么想
I wanted to sell. And I'm not the only one, by the way.

40
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,610
但你完全忽视了我们的意见
But you completely disregarded that

41
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,120
就因为你能和他有什么神秘感应
based on some mysterious feeling you got off

42
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,160
而你还明明告诉我们不要相信他
the one person you told the rest of us never to trust.

43
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,630
我是不会道歉的
I'm not going to apologize.

44
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,770
你有意见吗
Is that going to be a problem?

45
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,370
没有
No.

46
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,960
等有了机会  我觉得我们得换一家网络
When we're able, I think we should find another network.

47
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,760
我们也该和乔·麦克米伦分道扬镳了
It's about time we got out of the Joe Macmillan business.

48
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,600
同意
Yeah, agreed.

49
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,750
-什么时候  -今早去市政厅办的
- When? - This morning at city hall.

50
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,700
我们希望你第一个知道
We wanted to tell you first.

51
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,090
你怎么能这么做
Why would you do that?

52
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,830
难道这种事不该事先告诉我一声吗
Don't you think that's something I'd wanna know about?

53
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,890
-不该让我在场吗  -我们希望就两个人
- To be there? - Well, we wanted it to be the two of us.

54
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,060
不要什么盛大婚宴  只有两个相爱的人
No big party, just two people in love.

55
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,930
别生气  爸  这是好事
Don't be upset, dad. This is good news.

56
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,670
我为你高兴
I'm happy for you.

57
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,770
不过就是  你是我的女儿
It's just... You're my daughter.

58
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,270
乔  我想你应该能明白
Joe, I'm sure you can understand

59
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,410
我为什么希望出席我唯一女儿的婚礼
why I'd want to be at my only daughter's wedding.

60
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,130
先生  我们绝不是有意不敬
Sir, we meant no disrespect.

61
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,320
你似乎特别喜欢对别人搞突然袭击
You seem to be making a habit of springing things on people.

62
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,040
这是我们共同的决定  又不是他逼我的
We did this together. It wasn't inflicted on me.

63
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,950
其实还是我拍板的呢
It was my decision, actually.

64
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,440
你为什么要觉得是在气你
Look, why are you making this about you?

65
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,670
我刚刚告诉你我结婚了
I just told you I got married.

66
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,230
你应该为我感到高兴
You should be happy for me.

67
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,660
抱歉
I'm sorry.

68
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,150
恭喜了
Congratulations.

69
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,060
你们俩新婚快乐
To both of you.

70
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,450
多谢
Thank you.

71
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,820
如果没什么事的话  我要去告诉卡罗琳了
Well, if you'll excuse me for a moment, I'll go tell Caroline.

72
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,960
也许她的态度会好些
Maybe I'll get a better reaction out of her.

73
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,400
你来不是光想说这一件事的吧
I take it there's something else you want to discuss with me?

74
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,390
莎拉很不喜欢卡罗琳
Sara can't stand Caroline.

75
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,880
虽然我非常感激您在这里给我的机会
As much as I appreciate the opportunity you've given me here,

76
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,060
但我想我该开始新的生活了
I think it's time for me to move on.

77
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,690
莎拉和我要搬去加州
Sara and I are moving to California.

78
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,980
抱歉同时把这么多意外丢给您
I'm sorry to lay all this on you at once.

79
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,910
不不  你说得对
No, no, no. You're right.

80
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,950
也许你是该向前看了
Maybe it is time to move on.

81
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,670
我没意见
No hard feelings.

82
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,760
祝你将来顺风顺水
Best of luck in all your future endeavors.

83
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,170
我很乐意帮你找一位继任者
Uh, I'm happy to help you find a replacement.

84
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,270
不用了  让我们的人来办就好
No, that's okay. I'll leave that up to our people.

85
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,400
-他们会找到合适人选的  -好
- They'll find the right guy. - Okay.

86
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,840
我可以多待一阵子  等你找到人再走
I can stick around until you've got someone in place.

87
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,100
说什么傻话
Don't be silly.

88
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,880
我连个像样的婚礼都不能给我女儿
I couldn't give my daughter a wedding.

89
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,060
最起码也要让她过个舒心蜜月吧
The least I can do is give her a honeymoon.

90
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,480
这么着
I'll tell you what.

91
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,770
你去找卡罗琳要我私人车库的钥匙
Ask Caroline for the keys to my private garage.

92
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,870
里面有辆57款的雪佛兰敞篷
There's a '57 bel air convertible in there,

93
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,280
崭新的  随开随走
pristine and ready to go.

94
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,280
你拿去开几周  出去好好逛逛
Take it for a couple of weeks. Hit the road.

95
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,800
我会和莎拉说一下的
Uh, I'll talk to Sara about that.

96
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,710
-谢谢  -不客气
- Thank you. - You bet.

97
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,290
我  很遗憾穆特尼的交易没成
I, uh... sorry the Mutiny deal didn't go through.

98
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,780
我在这行已经混了很久了
I've been in this game long enough

99
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,500
知道事情并不总会如我所愿
to know things don't always break my way.

100
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,060
蜜月愉快
Enjoy the honeymoon.

101
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,750
你好  戈登
Hey, Gordon.

102
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,390
怎么回事
What the heck?

103
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,640
抱歉
Sorry.

104
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,480
你没事吧  怎么了
You okay? What was it?

105
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,080
没什么
It was nothing.

106
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,590
没什么
It was nothing.

107
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:32,810
{\an8}欢迎穆特尼用户

108
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,350
好  我们调试了楼梯那段
Okay, we did the debugging of the staircase...

109
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,750
你重新配置了游戏菜单吗
and you reconfigured the game menu?

110
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,540
对  我想简单过一遍
Yeah, I want to go over it briefly,

111
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,350
但我觉得我们基本调试好了
But, yeah, I think we're basically there.

112
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,270
我们调试好了
We are there.

113
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,040
我们做到了  搞定了
We did it. It's done.

114
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,290
-完美了  -不  不
- It's perfect. - No. No.

115
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,170
我想再优化一些东西
I want to tweak a few more things

116
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,800
加上版权保护  或许
and copy protect it and maybe

117
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,610
重写屏幕顶上的滚动条信息
rewrite some of the scroll at the top.

118
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,370
-太乱了  -什么  版权保护吗
- It's messy. - What? Copy protect it?

119
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,390
但我们不那样  我们是穆特尼
But we don't do that. We're Mutiny.

120
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,290
我们都写了一些很棒的代码
Uh, well, we both wrote some pretty bitching code.

121
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,450
你希望被别人偷走吗
You want someone taking that?

122
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,220
我就是通过模仿再拆分别人的工作学的写代码
I learned to code by copying other people's work, pulling it apart.

123
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,920
你也一样
So did you.

124
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,400
对  我的工作也被剽窃过  并不美好
Yeah, I've also had my work stolen. It's not pretty.

125
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,690
如果你版权保护了视差  我们就不会相遇
We never would've met if you had copy protected "Parallax".

126
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,350
对  但我们相遇了
Yeah, but we did meet.

127
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,000
所以  鉴于我们已经相遇了
So, because we met,

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,230
现在我可以版权保护我们的工作
now I can copy protect our work

129
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,450
而不用担心我们不会相遇
without fear of us not meeting.

130
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,600
别这样  我们写了这么赞的游戏
Come on, we wrote this amazing game.

131
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,610
我不想被人从我们手中抢走
I don't want anyone taking it from us.

132
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,640
卡梅伦  你来不来
Hey, Cameron, you coming or what?

133
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,690
好了  都收拾好了
All right, yeah, everything's squared away.

134
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,310
酒桶已经送到  桌子也到了
Okay, kegs have been delivered, tables are here,

135
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,790
笨蛋在后面装广播系统呢
nitwit's setting up the PA out back.

136
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,230
你要带人来吗
You bringing anybody?

137
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,670
也许吧  到时候看
Maybe. We'll see.

138
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,620
会很有趣的
This is gonna be so much fun.

139
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,980
就像一次进行一百场奇怪的初次约会
Ugh, it's gonna be like a hundred awkward first dates at once.

140
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,710
天呐  这些人是谁  我们都不认识
God, who are these people? We don't even know.

141
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,260
这是友好地表示感谢他们
It's a nice way to say thank you

142
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,360
无论起落都坚持做我们的用户
for sticking with us through all the ups and downs.

143

以大人物的姿态出现

戈登  我们最近考虑了很多  我觉得...
Uh, Gordon, we've been giving it some thought, and, um, I think--

235
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,780
不是我们不相信你的公司
It's-- it's not that we don't believe in what you're doing here.

236
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,000
不  绝对不是

有什么风险呢  我们有250张订单要完成
What's the risk? We got 250 orders waiting to be filled.

241
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,130
是的  但我们太老了
We sure do, but we're a little old

242
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,260
不能把未来赌在这上面
to be bettin' our future on this.

243
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,710
怎么  斯坦带你们出去了一趟
So, what? Stan take you out,

244
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,470
在你们脑袋里灌满了
fill your head with visions

245
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,300
风投资金满地流的幻觉吗
of vc money flowing through the streets?

246
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,680
不  不是那样

也是从头起步的

249
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,160
而且绝不是在大公司的办公室里
and it's not in a big corporate office.

250
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,210
而是在一个车库里  三个人卷起袖子
It's in a garage with three guys rolling up their sleeves,

251
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,810
相信自己的能力  做出了伟大的东西

你们将来就是在外面看着羡慕的人
You know, you guys are gonna be the ones on the outside lookin' in.

255
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,860

I'm sure you're right. But right now I--

256
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,130
我觉得我们已经拿定主意了
I think we've pretty much made up our minds.

257
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,230
你要接电话吗
You gonna answer that?

258
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,570
-喂  -茱尔丝是谁

259
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,070
-什么  -我刚刚打过一通电话

260
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,750
好像信号不好
I think the connection was bad.

261
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,270
没谁  你有什么事
Oh, uh, no one. What do you want?

262

264
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,660
我马上过去
I'll be right over there.

265
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,160
抱歉  戈登
Sorry, Gordon.

266
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,480
我相信没有我们你也会做得很好的
I'm sure you'll do fine without us.

267
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,850
你们就是俩懦夫
You guys are a couple of cowards.

268
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,500

00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,440
我们不是说要玩角色扮演吗  间谍和哨兵
I thought we were going in character, spy and sentry.

277
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,970
我们是讨论过  但我不...
Uh, yeah, we talked about it, but I didn't--

278
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,610
不是吧你  这下我傻帽了
Seriously? Now I look weird.

279
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,970
那你来吗
Well, are you comin'?

280
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,080
我要去做点事  收个尾
I'm-- uh, yeah. I'm gonna do some work and finish up,

281
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,410
一会儿就出来
but I'll be out in a minute.

282
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,930
-好吧  -你看上去很不错
- Okay. - You look good.

283
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:58,930
谢谢
Thanks.

284
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,230
除了主机箱都是标准的
It's all standard except for the custom cabinets.

285
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,050
交换机连接到3090型服务器的系统网络接口
Connect the PBXs to the SNA inputs on the 3090, okay?

286
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,520
都在这里
It's all here,

287
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,640
但如有必要你可以把我的号码给他们
But you can give 'em my number if need be.

288
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,180
别这么快
Mm, back it up a little bit.

289
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,710
我需要你跟他讲讲我们所做的一切
I need you to walk him through what we've done.

290
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,900
我没这个时间
I don't have time for that.

291
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,170
给他这个就行  告诉他我跟你说的话
Just give him this, tell him what I told you,

292
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,120
他会明白的  好吗
He'll understand, all right?

293
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,150
好
Okay.

294
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,000
你没事吧
Everything all right?

295
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,580
嗯  我很好
Yeah, I'm good.

296
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,980
你呢  还有
How are you? How's, uh--?

297
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,850
莎拉  她很好
Sara. She's great.

298
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,470
好
Good.

299
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,470
我们结婚了
We got married.

300
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,500
什么
What?

301
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,330
没错  我们这几周
Yeah, we spent the past couple weeks

302
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,560
都在加州度蜜月
in California on our honeymoon.

303
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,020
真的吗
No kiddin'.

304
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,600
恭喜你们
Congratulations.

305
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,420
回头见  乔
See you later, Joe.

306
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,230
嗯
Yeah.

307
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,360
我们要搬去加州
Think we're movin' out there, to California,

308
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,680
所以我们要走了
so we'll be leaving.

309
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,700
也许一时半会儿见不到了
So this might be a good-bye for a while.

310
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:58,860
那么
Well, hey.

311
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,490
祝你好运
Best of luck.

312
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,660
你也是
Yeah, you, too.

313
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,540
我们登陆月球了吗  当然没有
Have we landed on the moon? Of course not.

314
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,760
你们看过《最后的星球斗士》吧
I mean, you guys have seen "Last Starfighter," right?

315
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,530
现在一切都能用特效做出来
They can do anything with special effects these days,

316
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,850
但谁最先拿到那种技术的呢
And who has access to that technology first?

317
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,250
是好莱坞吗
Hollywood?

318
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,520
不是吧
I don't think so.

319
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,100
詹姆斯  你好吗
James, how are ya?

320
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,240
那么这就是穆特尼了
Okay, so, this is Mutiny.

321
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,010
对  就是这里
Yeah, this is it.

322
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,890
来  我带你四处转转
Come on, let me show you around.

323
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,860
博迪
Hey, Bodie.

324
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,350
这是我儿子詹姆斯
This is my son James.

325
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,870
真奇怪啊
Weird.

326
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,520
认识你很高兴
Nice to meet you.

327
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,350
博斯竟然有个儿子
Boz has a son.

328
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:46,840
走吧
Come on.

329
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,030
詹姆斯  我跟你说
You know, I tell you, James.

330
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,260
也许看不出来  但这些孩子都聪明绝顶
It may not look like much, but these kids are brilliant.

331
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,940
你不会相信的
You would not believe.

332
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,270
你在干吗呢  为什么不出去
What are you doing? Why aren't you outside?

333
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,560
我只是在给游戏收尾  马上就出去
Uh, I'm just finishing up the game. I'll be out in a minute.

334
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,420
游戏已经完成了  快点
The game is done. Come on.

335
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,650
这可是你的公司
This is your company.

336
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,530
看来以为能说服你别那么做真是太傻了
Well, I guess it was stupid to think I talked you out of it.

337
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,940
别这样  我在保护我们的作品
Oh, come on. I'm protecting our work.

338
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,160
你对我有一丁点尊重吗
Do you have any respect for me?

339
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,490
我十分尊重你
I respect the shit out of you.

340
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,120
你不尊重我的想法
You don't value my opinion--

341
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,230
-算了  -不  汤姆  怎么了
- Never mind. - No, Tom. What?

342
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,560
快说啊  这里人人都生我气
Come on, everyone is pissed at me in this house

343
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,640
但又没人肯说出来
and no one's saying anything.

344
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,840
快把我逼疯了  究竟怎么了
It's driving me crazy. What is it?

345
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,750
好吧  让我生气的是  我说想卖掉
Okay, it pisses me off that I told you that I wanted to sell,

346
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,020
-可后来乔告诉你不该卖  -我的天
- and then Joe tells you that you shouldn't... - Oh, god.

347
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,470
-而你听从了他的意见  -你想卖掉
- ...And that you listened to him. - You want to sell?

348
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,030
-汤姆  他们想毁了我们  -不是为了那个
- Tom, they were gonna ruin this company! - It's not about--

349
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,830
不是卖不卖的问题  而是关于你和我
No, it's not about the sale. It's about you and me.

350
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,760
好吧  你听好了  如果你想分手
Fine, you know what? Just break up with me

351
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,240
那就分手好了  我们也能...
if you're gonna break up with me and we can--

352
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,310
我不想和你分手  我只是...
I'm not gonna break up with you. I'm just--

353
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,710
我是生你的气  你懂吗
I'm just mad at you, okay?

354
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,100
我可以生你的气吧
And I can be mad at you, right?

355
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,860
-你什么意思  想辞职吗  -不  我不想辞职
- So, what, you wanna quit? - No, I don't want to quit.

356
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,190
我爱你  我为什么要辞职
I love you. Why would I quit?

357
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,990
你以前没和人有过不同意见吗
Have you ever had a disagreement before?

358
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,130
我们不过是在谈谈  是人都谈话
We're just talking. People talk.

359
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,910
人们还打架  还争论
They fight. They argue.

360
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,630
这是常有的事
It happens every single day.

361
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,560
你爱我
You love me?

362
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,220
什么  不  你这是乱说
What? N-no-- now you're putting words in my mouth.

363
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:18,800
不  你刚刚说了
No. You said those words.

364
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,100
就是这位  卡梅伦老板
Hey, there she is, the big boss, Cameron.

365
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,960
这是我儿子詹姆斯
This is my son James.

366
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,080
喂
Hello?

367
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,330
小宝贝  露营怎么样
Hey, hey, sweetie. How's camp?

368
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,770
是吗  你做了什么
Oh, yeah? What'd you make?

369
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,180
摇摆木马  你一个人做的吗
A rocking horse? All by yourself?

370
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,430
上色了吗
Did you paint it?

371
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,800
JDL定制电脑

372
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,470
JDL定制电脑

373
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,190
紫色
Purple?

374
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,440
兔崽子
Son of a bitch.

375
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,430
抱歉  亲爱的  不是说你
No, sorry, sweetheart. Not you.

376
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,630
听起来很棒嘛  亲爱的
That all sounds great, sweetie.

377
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,590
爸爸得挂了  好吗
Look, dad's gotta go, okay?

378
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,070
你明天打给我好吗
Will you call me tomorrow?

379
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,900
好的  好的  我爱你
Okay. Okay, I love you.

380
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,790
是啊  戈登·克拉克的想法真是与众不同
Yeah, Gordon Clark's got a unique mind.

381
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,050
-是啊  这个想法不错  -是啊
- Clearly. This is pretty cool. - Yeah.

382
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,720
如果你要改成更传统的布局
Yeah, if you're gonna switch over to a more conventional setup,

383
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,130
那我最好还是再留几天
maybe it'd be best if I stuck around for a few days

384
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,460
帮你检查故障吧
to help troubleshoot with you.

385
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,680
你还有更重要的事要做
You got bigger fish to fry.

386
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,710
加州在召唤呢  对吧
California's calling, right?

387
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,970
对啊
Yeah.

388
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,930
你真的该找个硬件专家来
You should definitely bring on a hardware specialist.

389
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,700
扩容工作会需要这方面的丰富经验
The expansion's gonna require lots of expertise in that area.

390
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,150
后面的事就让我来操心吧
I got it from here. It's my problem to worry about.

391
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,140
谢谢你的帮助
Thanks for your help.

392
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,570
莱夫

393
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,460
-莱夫  你来了  -大家好啊
- Lev, you made it! -  Hey, guys.

394
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,450
-悠悠球  -真逗

396
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,440

- I wasn't about to miss this. - I know.

397
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,720
我想看看这些怪人本尊是什么样
Wanted to see what these freaks were like in person.

398
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,360
见到你真好
It's really good to see you.

399
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,180
莱夫  你看起来好虚弱
Lev! You look so fragile.

400
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,000
我想抱抱你  可是...
I want to hug you, but--

401
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,660
轻点就行  博迪
Just be careful, Bodie.

402
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,800
听说新游戏很棒
Heard the new game was pretty cool.

403
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,200
就想来看看
Decided to check it out.

404
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,560
是啊  我觉得你会喜欢的
Yeah, I think you'll dig it.

405
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,510
谢谢你能来
Thanks for coming.

406
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,430
-卡梅伦  -怎么了
- Cameron? - Yeah.

407
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,790
大家都到了
Hey, we're all here now.

408
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,890
我觉得该致辞了
I feel like it's a good time to say something.

409
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,010
-好  去吧  -不  不是我  是你
- Yeah, go ahead. - No, not me, you.

410
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,080
不  唐娜  我真不喜欢致辞
No, Donna, I really don't like to do that.

411
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,780
-快去  -好吧
- Go. - Okay.

412
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,130
大家好
Hello.

413
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,360

415
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,210
为初次见面的各位自我介绍一下

现在我想为大家介绍
And now I would like to introduce to you

419
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,940
穆特尼的主脑
the mind behind Mutiny,

420
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,060
我们的领袖  卡梅伦·豪伊
our leader Cameron Howe!

421
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,310
-棒  卡梅伦  -豪伊  豪伊  豪伊

开场词不错
Nice start!

424
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,090
就是这样
There it is.

425
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,360
我们要宣布一件事
Oh, we have an announcement to make.

426
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,340
今天我们在为新游戏进行最后的润色
Uh, today we're putting the finishing touches on our latest game.

427
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,180
游戏的名字叫做《营救保卫战》
It's called "Extract & defend."

428
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,290
棒
Yeah!

429
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,400
今天来了多少玩家
How many gamers do we have here today?

430
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,660
这里
Yes!

431
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:55,360
我想大家会喜欢我们的游戏
Well, I think you guys are really gonna love what we've done, so...

432
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,890
走  去拿杯啤酒
Come on. Let's grab a beer.

433
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:58,990
好
All right.

434
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,690
跟你的出版商朋友说过了吗
Talk to your publisher friend?

435
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,360
珍妮特吗  说了
Jeanette? Yeah.

436
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,070
我们到了我要约她喝咖啡
I'm gonna meet with her for coffee once we're back out there.

437
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,240
你的最后一天如何  新人怎么样
How was your last day? How's the new guy?

438
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,640
他很棒  我很喜欢他
Uh, yeah, he's great. Like him a lot.

439
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,210
很年轻
Young.

440
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,690
没有我期望的硬件经验  不过...
Doesn't have the hardware experience I would've expected, but...

441
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,300
也不错了
seems nice enough.

442
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,650
-你讨厌他  -什么  不
- You hated him? - What? No.

443
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,760
一点儿也不
Not at all.

444
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:24,350
这里明显有股厌恶的能量
Well, there's a palpable hate energy here.

445
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,350
不知道  我说不清楚
Oh, I don't know. I can't put my finger on it.

446
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,310
让他做这份工作似乎不太合适
He seems like an odd choice for the job.

447
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,070
你会想念它的
You're gonna miss it.

448
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,000
还会有其他机会
Oh, there'll be other projects

449
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,920
比试图将石油公司带入未来
way more exciting than trying to take

450
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,790
刺激得多的工作
an oil company into the future.

451
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,210
当然  是啊
Of course, yeah.

452
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,400
过来
Hey, come here.

453
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,400
过来
Come here.

454
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,130
你是自然之力
You're a force of nature.

455
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,350
你将世界打造成你想要的样子
All right? You make the world what you want it to be.

456
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,280
到了加州也是一样
It'll happen in California, too.

457
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,610
不如这样吧
H-how about this?

458
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,430
我们今晚离开现实世界
How about we step out of reality for the night,

459
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,760
来一次硬重启
a hard reboot?

460
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,740
我觉得等你到了外面
I think once you're outside,

461
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,810
就会意识到什么是真正重要的东西
you'll realize what's really important.

462
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,350
我怎么到外面去
How do I get on the outside?

463
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,790
我打扫柜子时发现了一些东西
Well, I found something when I was cleaning out the closet.

464
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,780
-那是什么  -摇头丸
- What is that? - MDMA.

465
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,850
我写调查报告时用的
From when I was doing the exposé.

466
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,200
我们今晚出去玩吧  我们去斯塔克俱乐部
Let's go out tonight. Let's go to the Starck Club.

467
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,490
好好向达拉斯告别
We can bid Dallas a fond farewell.

468
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,320
让他们知道他们会失去什么
Show them what they'll be missing.

469
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,280
-你还记得大学时那个莎拉吗  -记得
- You remember college Sara? - Yeah.

470
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,080
我一直跟不上她的节奏
I couldn't keep up with her.

471
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,980
那你最好加把劲了
Well, you'd better do your best.

472
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,290
你来了
Hey, you made it!

473
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,890
感谢上帝  有几个人你真该见见
Thank god! There's some people here you really have to meet.

474
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,260
有个人  在社区结识了女友
This one guy, he proposed to his girlfriend

475
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,110
已经向她求婚了
after they met on community.

476
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,040
-多棒啊  -非常棒  亲爱的
- How cool is that? - That's, uh-- that's great, honey.

477
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,140
看
Look.

478
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,130
-怎么了  怎么回事  -有人偷了我的点子
- What? What is this? - Someone stole my idea.

479
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,400
你的点子关键在你  在于戈登·克拉克
Oh, well, your idea is about you. It's about Gordon Clark.

480
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,340
专家打造的电脑
Computers handmade by an expert.

481
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,540
谁知道这些家伙是谁
Who knows who these guys are?

482
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,290
你看  价位一模一样
All right, look. The price point's the same.

483
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,270
连宣传口号都几乎一样
I mean, the slogan's nearly identical.

484
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:29,110
戈登  别这样  来喝点啤酒  好好享受派对
Gordon, come on. Let's get a beer. Let's enjoy the party.

485
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,020
我觉得是斯坦干的
I think it was Stan.

486
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,890
什么  就是那个斯坦吗
What, Stan, Stan?

487
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,500
我觉得他拉上了艾德和拉里
I think he got Ed and Larry involved.

488
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,340
我该去找他吗...
Should I go over there? I mean, should--

489
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,080
-不  -我应该说些什么吗
- No. - Should I say something?

490
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,890
不  我觉得算了吧
No, I don't think so.

491
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:46,940
我们可以...我们明天再仔细看看
Look, we can-- we should take a careful look at this tomorrow.

492
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,780
可能只是一个巧合
It's probably just a coincidence.

493
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,110
就算不是
Even if it's not,

494
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,640
克拉克电脑的地位也不会受到撼动
there's nothing they can do to hurt Clark Computers

495
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,870
因为他们没有最珍贵的资源  对吗
'cause they don't have the most valuable asset, right?

496
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,390
来嘛  我们好好玩玩
Come on, let's go hang out a little bit.

497
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,440
不
No.

498
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,770
我觉得我还是回家吧  我有点累了
I think I'd better go home. I'm feeling a little fried.

499
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,310
好吧
Oh, okay.

500
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,290
去吧  去睡一会儿吧
Yeah, go-- go get some sleep, then.

501
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:10,920
好
Okay.

502
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,990
唐娜  你看
Hey, Donna! Check this out!

503
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,790
谢了
Thanks.

504
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,300
-你是卡梅伦·豪伊吗  -是啊
- Cameron Howe? - Yeah.

505
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,760
不好意思  你还不认识我
Sorry, you don't know me.

506
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,480
我叫格雷琴
My name is Gretchen.

507
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,370
这是你的公司吧
This is your company, right?

508
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,960
是啊
Uh... Yeah.

509
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,190
是啊  没错
Yeah, it is.

510
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:48,090
我只是想说谢谢你
I just want to say thank you.

511
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,180
我们家一团糟
My family's kind of screwed up.

512
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,330
简直糟糕透顶
Well, really screwed up.

513
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,320
在我发现穆特尼之前  根本没法找人倾诉
I didn't have anyone to talk to about it until I found Mutiny.

514
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,300
那里有很多人
There are a bunch of people

515
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,560
也面临同样的问题  他们帮助了我
dealing with the same sort of stuff and they help me.

516
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,560
他们帮我意识到  我可以一走了之
They helped me realize that-- that I could walk away.

517
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,000
我没有什么毛病
that there wasn't anything wrong with me.

518
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,250
要是没有你  我根本做不到
And I couldn't have done that without you.

519
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,670
如果你觉得奇怪  那很抱歉
I'm sorry if that sounds weird.

520
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,750
不会
No.

521
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,450
谢谢
Thank you.

522
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,890
没事  不客气
No, it's not at all.

523
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,180
感觉好棒
This feels so good!

524
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,620
不是吧
Oh-ho, really?

525
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:56,850
跟上节奏哦
Try and keep up.

526
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,880
新娘怎么样了
Hey, how's the bride?

527
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,550
你们打算生孩子吗
You gonna pop out a couple of pups?

528
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,490
回头再说吧  有的是时间
Oh, we'll see. We got time.

529
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,270
你妈妈肯定会高兴的
It'd sure make your mom happy.

530
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,240
为这个原因要孩子太糟糕了
That's a terrible reason to have children.

531
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,460
是啊
Yes, indeed.

532
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,530
詹姆斯
Well, James...

533
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,060
-谢谢你能来  -当然的
- Thanks for coming. - Sure.

534
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,200
爸爸  我知道有个工作在招人
Listen, dad, I know about this job opening.

535
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,700
是个客户经理的位置
It's, uh, an account manager's position.

536
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,320
我知道你离开卡迪夫时是个副总裁
And I know you left Cardiff as a vp,

537
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,070
但这公司不错  我认识那些人
but it's a solid company. I know the people.

538
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,800
我可以替你美言一句
I could put in a good word.

539
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,690
可以让你离开这里
We can get you out of here.

540
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,840
-谢谢  詹姆斯  -嗯
- Thank you, James. - Yeah.

541
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,550
好了
Okay, all right.

542
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,200
-好吧  晚安  -晚安  儿子
- All right, good night. - All right, good night, son.

543
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,370
你一直在躲我
Hey, you've been avoiding me.

544
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,730
-没有啊  -就是有
- No, I haven't. - Yes, you have.

545
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,200
自从你说了"我爱你"之后
Ever since you said you love me.

546
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,910
嗯  好吧  我爱你
Yes, fine. I love you.

547
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,780
而且  要我说"我爱你"都算轻的了
In fact, I would say "I love you" is a dramatic understatement.

548
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,700
我觉得你方方面面都不可思议
I think you're incredible in pretty much every way.

549
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,830
如果这对你来说是个问题
If it's gonna be a problem for you,

550
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:59,400
那我也没办法  因为
then I don't know what to say, because...

551
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:04,380
事情就是如此  这是不会变的
it is what it is and it's not gonna change,

552
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,390
即使你像今天这一整天那样
even when you're being a total pain in the ass,

553
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:10,200
烦人透顶
like you have been this entire day.

554
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,890
好吧
Okay.

555
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,850
你就说出来吧
Just say the words, okay?

556
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:24,180
你如果不说  要别扭死了
This is gonna be so much weirder if you don't just say the words.

557
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,190
看着我
Look at me, look at me.

558
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,890
说出来吧
Say the words.

559
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,630
不行
No.

560
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,670
怎么了...说啊  说出来
What's... say the words. Just say them.

561
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,330
你坏死了
You're terrible.

562
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,830
我收回  我全部收回
I take it back. I take it all back.

563
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,000
天呐  戈登
Jesus, Gordon?

564
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,490
你干什么呢
What the hell are you doing here?

565
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,690
我知道你偷了我的点子
I know you stole my idea.

566
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,250
JGL电脑  有印象吗
JGL Computers. Sound familiar?

567
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,060
你让他们给我搞破坏
You had the guys sabotage me.

568
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,940
串行接口  还在上面写我的名字
The serial ports, putting my name on the back of it

569
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,770
好让克拉克电脑出丑
just to make Clark Computers look like a joke.

570
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,150
我根本不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

571
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,440
否则你为什么从加州回来
Why else would you come back from California?

572
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,980
你要用风投的钱
You gonna use some of that VC money

573
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,320
启动你的公司吗  你个混蛋
to get it started, you son of a bitch?

574
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,370
我回来是因为我受够了被一群25岁的毛头小子
I came back because I was tired of being laughed out of the room

575
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,650
哄笑赶走
by a bunch of 25-year-olds.

576
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,530
-我被淘汰了  -那这些都是什么
- I washed out. - Well, then, what the hell are these?

577
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,320
我总得挣钱  我在做维修
I gotta make ends meet. I'm doing repairs.

578
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,800
整天开车到处收集废旧机器
I'm driving around all day picking up these busted machines.

579
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,030
戈登  我能问问吗  你又嗑可卡因了吗
Gordon, can I ask? Are you doing coke again?

580
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,660
什么
What?

581
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,050
当然没有
No, of course not.

582
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,500
你为什么要那么想啊
Why would you even think that?

583
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,830
因为你大半夜闯进我车库
'cause you're in my garage in the middle of the night

584
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,640
指责我偷了你的点子
accusing me of stealing from you.

585
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,140
唐娜叫哥几个盯着你点
Donna told the guys to keep an eye on you,

586
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,870
而且他们说  你最近表现是不太正常
and according to them, you've been acting a little nuts.

587
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:25,260
-唐娜叫你做什么  -我不知道
- Donna told you what? - I don't know.

588
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,370
是他们说  这下我卷进
But the guys said... now I'm getting into the middle of something

589
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,500
-我不想掺和的事里了  -跟你说什么了
- that I don't want to get... - Told you what?

590
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,810
她说你如果表现怪怪的就告诉她
That... she said to tell her if you were acting strange

591
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:36,310
或者如果感觉你被工作累坏了什么的
Or, you know, like the job was taking a toll on you or something.

592
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,990
她是担心你
She was worried about you.

593
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,640
唐娜
Donna?

594
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,960
难以置信
Unbelievable.

595
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,300
你觉得她是想害我歇业吗
You think she's trying to shut me down?

596
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,230
天呐  又是这样
God, it's the same thing all over again.

597
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,140
不不  你误会了
No, no, no, you got it all wrong.

598
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,420
她只是担心你
She was looking out for you.

599
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,880
你叫警察来抓我
You called the cops on me?

600
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,380
斯坦  你干吗报警抓我
Stan, why would you call the cops on me?

601
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,120
我听到有人闯进我家啊
Because I heard someone breaking into my house.

602
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,370
斯坦  你怎么想的  你干吗这么做
Stan, what were you thinking? Why would you do that?

603
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,230
-干什么  -没事的
- Hey, what the hell? - It's okay.

604
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,680
-够了  -我只想跟我朋友谈谈
- That's it, that's it. - I just want to talk to my friend

605
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,170
问他他为什么要报警抓我
and ask him why he called the cops on me.

606
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,980
我只想谈谈
I just wanted to talk...

607
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,380
你好棒
You're amazing.

608
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,050
好棒
Amazing.

609
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,160
我觉得我有很多优点  很多优秀之处
I feel like there's a lot of goodness in me, a lot of greatness,

610
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,200
但却发挥不出来  无法展现给世界
but I can't get it out of me. I can't give it to the world.

611
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,340
我有想法  我不是个回声
I have ideas. I'm not an echo.

612
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:50,260
我能在脑袋里构想  却做不出来
I make things in my mind, but I can't get them into the world.

613
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,560
我过不了这一关  像个陷阱一样
I can't get past this. It's like a trap.

614
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:57,500
就好像世界不肯看到真正的我
Like the world won't see the... me... the real me.

615
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,200
不  我看到你了
Oh, no, I see you.

616
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,960
你是自然之力
You're a force of nature.

617
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,750
你会改变世界的
You're gonna change the world.

618
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,040
我有想法
I have ideas.

619
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,920
在线可以有大发展
Online could be more.

620
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,800
而不是只有程序员们
It could be more than just inside bullshit

621
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,620
才懂的天书
for anointed coder shitheads.

622
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,890
是可以走向全球的  可以在上面生活的
It could be universal. You could live your life there.

623
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,580
它能改变一切的  我保证
It would change everything, I promise you.

624
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:20,550
我们如今生活的世界到时候会像石器时代
The world we live in now is going to look like the stone age.

625
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,860
这些人  他们的东西
All these people with their things.

626
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,860
这个物质世界已死
The physical world is dead.

627
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,560
一条道路正在修建起来
A pathway is being built.

628
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,150
这条路通向纯粹信息的世界
A way out, into a world of pure information.

629
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,340
集体意识
A shared consciousness.

630
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,320
未来像一列货运列车一样
The future is bearing down on us

631
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,830
向我们压了过来  却没人看得到
like a freight train and nobody sees it.

632
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,450
要走了吗
Is this a good good-bye?

633
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,140
准备离开达拉斯了吗
You ready to get the hell outta Dallas?

634
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,680
我再道别一下
I just wanna say one last good-bye.

635
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:49,380
我一直告诉自己穆特尼的关键是游戏
I kept telling myself that Mutiny was games, we are about games.

636
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,880
我觉得  我知道今天我如果走出去
And I think... I knew that if I went outside today

637
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,780
看到你成就的一切
and saw what you'd done that

638
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,320
我就再也没法那么骗自己了
I wouldn't be able to tell myself that anymore.

639
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,940
结果我想对了
It turns out I was right.

640
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,880
我只是希望这里能做探索先锋
I just want this place to be about exploration.

641
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,710
抱歉我挡了你的路
I'm sorry that I stood in your way.

642
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,740
谢谢
Thank you.

643
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,250
我也想参与进来
I'd like to be a part of it.

644
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,910
你已经参与了啊  你建造了这里
You are a part of it. You built this place.

645
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:27,110
不  我是指
No, but I mean...

646
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,190
在游戏这边  我们一直在改进代码  对吧
So, on the game side, we're always pushing the code, right?

647
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,880
我们总想做到最好
We're trying to get the most out of it.

648
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,560
如果我们把这种精力拿到社区上去呢
But what if we applied that same pressure to community?

649
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,860
其功能会大大提升
I mean, the functionality of it could explode.

650
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:41,230
运行更快  主题间切换更自如
It could run faster, smoother between subjects

651
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:43,670
或者找到特定用户对话更方便
or finding certain users' conversations.

652
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,890
嗯  那些都对
Yeah, yeah, all of that,

653
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:47,320
另外  我们还可以做界面
and then also we could make the interface

654
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,850
做得更像游戏  但不是
more like a game's interface, except not.

655
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:52,660
这是一个需要探索的世界
But, you know, it was a world to navigate

656
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,630
不是一张清单  是一张地图
and not a list, but it was a map, you know?

657
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,610
这地方让你性奋吗
This place turns you on?

658
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,800
相当性奋
You have no idea.

659
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,350
天呐
Oh, my god.

660
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,610
我们得走了
Okay, we gotta go.

661
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,440
快点  穿上裤子
Come on. Pants...

662
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,380
我去看看怎么回事
I want to see what's going on.

663
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,180
不不  等等
No, no, no, wait.

664
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,170
他们看不见我们
They can't see us.

665
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:49,700
我爸爸如果知道了  我死定了
If my father hears about this, I'm gonna die.

666
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,090
你上车  我待会儿去找你
You go to the limo and I'll meet you there.

667
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,480
我...会小心的
I'm... I'll be stealthy.

668
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,160
还有什么比这更好
What's better than this?

669
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:16,760
好了
All right.

670
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:20,950
好了
Okay.

671
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,420
我想下来恭喜大家干得好  各位
I just wanted to come down here to say job well done, guys.

672
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,850
这个任务并不轻松
It was a bitch of an assignment,

673
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,210
但你们做得很好
but you guys stepped up, seriously.

674
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:28,910
所以...
So...

675
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,330
敬西方网络
To WestNet!

676
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:49,060
西方网络

677
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,660
天呐  然后还可以
Oh, my god, and then you could,

678
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,650
在话题间游走
you know, walk from topic to topic.

679
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,620
嗯  比那更好的是
Yeah, and better than that,

680
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,360
还可以在那些地方找到其他用户
you could find other users at those places.

681
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,190
嗯  我觉得我们该写下来
Yes, okay, I feel like we have to write this down.

682
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,130
我们有没有...
Do we have something...

683
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,130
卡尔  把公告板擦干净好吗
Carl, could you clear off the bulletin board?

684
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,090
我们要写一下社区的结构
We need to create a layout for community.

685
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:06,130
打印张所有聊天室的清单  卡尔
I want a list printed of every room... Carl.

686
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,590
卡尔  你看什么呢
Carl, what are you looking at?

687
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:15,570
我也不知道我看什么呢
I... I don't know what I'm looking at.

688
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,890
我登的是穆特尼
I logged into Mutiny.

689
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,530
以管理员身份登录一下
Try to log on as an administrator.

690
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,840
-我被锁在外面了  -怎么回事
- Uh, I'm locked out. - What's wrong?

691
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,550
我不明白  穆特尼呢
I don't get it. Where's Mutiny?

692
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,570
我们被踢下网络了
We're kicked off the network.

693
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,270
被这个替掉了
Replaced by this.

694
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,450
穆特尼没了
There is no Mutiny.

695
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,640
不见了
It's gone.

696
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,060
计划有变  我要先去个地方
Change of plans. I'd like to make another stop.

697
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,020
电话线都汇集到西方集团的调制解调器组
The phone lines terminate in modem banks at WestGroup.

698
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,690
他们给调包了  用户连接服务器时
They switched them over, so now when you dial in,

699
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:04,940
虽然连的地址没变
the same number you've always dialed,

700
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,810
但却进的是西方网络而不是穆特尼
you get WestNet instead of Mutiny.

701
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,060
他们偷了我们所有的用户
They've stolen all our users.

702
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,950
他们还克隆了我们的界面
They even cloned our interface,

703
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,100
大部分人可能都没发现这不穆特尼
so most people don't even know they're not on Mutiny.

704
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,120
他们会以为是我们换了名字
They think we changed the name.

705
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,010
上社区论坛
Okay, get on the community forums

706
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,450
告诉他们这不是穆特尼
and tell them they're not on Mutiny.

707
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:15,800
他们全克隆走了吗
What, they cloned the whole thing?

708
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,330
是啊  所有东西  除了游戏
Yes, everything, except games.

709
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,360
嗯  因为他发现摇钱树其实是社区
Yeah, 'cause he realized community is where the money was.

710
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,560
叫他们下线
Just tell them to log off

711
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,230
等我们换网络
and wait for us to find another network.

712
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,840
等我们  天呐
Wait for us? Oh, christ.

713
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,290
何必花500万美元买我们
I mean, why pay $5 million for us

714
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,700
他们可以直接复制我们  偷我们所有的用户
when they can just duplicate us and steal all of our users?

715
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,880
喂  我是穆特尼的汤姆·兰顿
Hello, hi, hi. This is Tom Rendon from Mutiny.

716
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,930
有家公司抢了我们的网络
Another company's taken over our network and I just...

717
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:35,600
不  看着像我们  但其实不是  你得下线
No, it looks like us, but it's not us. You need to log off.

718
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,280
我们会尽快上线  再过一两周吧
We'll be up again in... A week or two?

719
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,470
-喂  该死  -喂
- Hello... damn it! - Hello?

720
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,280
他们不明白
They don't understand.

721
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,020
他们还在跟同样的用户交流
They're still communicating with all the same users.

722
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,340
他们的朋友现在都上西方网络了
All of their friends are on WestNet now.

723
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,210
不不  怎么能这样
No, no, this isn't happening!

724
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,710
卡梅伦呢
Where's Cameron?

725
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:06,440
出事了  我得跟她谈谈
Something's happened and I need to talk to her.

726
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,720
卡梅伦呢
Where... where's Cameron?

727
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,340
卡梅伦呢
Where's Cameron?

728
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:11,980
我得跟她谈谈  出事了
I got... I need to talk to her. Something's wrong.

729
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,860
卡梅伦呢
Uh, where's... where's Cameron?

730
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,940
我直接跑过来了
I came straight here.

731
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,610
我完全不知情
I didn't know about this.

732
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,600
我不知道会这样
I didn't know that this was happening.

733
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,640
我完全不知道  维勒什么都没告诉我
I had no idea that... Wheeler shut me out and...

734
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,680
不  我...
No, I...

735
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,340
我要搬去加州了
I'm... I'm moving to California.

736
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,760
我几周前就交了辞呈
I... I gave my notice weeks ago.

737
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:49,030
我没理由做这种事  我是你这边的
There's no reason I would've done this. I'm on your side.

738
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,590
我不会这么做的
I wouldn't do this.

739
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,330
我保证  我不会的
I promise you, I wouldn't do this.

740
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,400
我不会这么做的
I wouldn't do this.

741
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,430
这根本没道理
It's... it doesn't make any sense.

742
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:06,170
有个人  杰西  是他干的
There's this guy, Jesse... he did this.

743
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,520
我不...我没有
I don't... I mean, I didn't...

744
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:10,990
该死
Damn it! Uh...

745
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,650
我都不在那儿工作了
I don't even work there.

746
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,050
我要去加州了
I'm going to California.

747
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:20,710
卡梅伦  你得听我的
Cameron, I need you to hear me.

748
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,140
你走吧
You need to leave.

749
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,600
不  你不懂
No, you don't understand.

750
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,840
走吧  乔
Now, Joe.

751
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,020
她为什么要这么做
Why would she be doing this?

752
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,820
她为什么要这么做
Why would she be doing this?

753
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,520
她为什么要这么做
Why would she be doing this?

754
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,460
你相信他吗
Do you believe him?

755
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,580
完全不信
Not for a second.

756
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,430
好吧  那我们怎么办
Okay, so what are we gonna do now?

757
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,420
卡梅伦  我们现在怎么办
Cameron, what are we gonna do now?

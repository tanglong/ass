We both know that's not gonna happen.

143
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,080
很遗憾没帮上忙
Sorry we couldn't help each other out.

144
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,380
跟乔·麦克米伦联手可没有好下场
Holding hands with Joe Macmillan never ends well.

145
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,940
相信我  我清楚
Trust me, I know.

146
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,880
你怎么会认为乔跟此事有关呢
What makes you think Joe had anything to do with this?

147
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,630
逗我呢
You gotta be kidding me.

148
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,340
我知道新书写什么了
I think I found my book idea.

149
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,980
上了飞机我就把框架写出来
I'm gonna start outlining it on the plane.

150
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,930
-不错啊  写什么  -你啊
- That's great. What's it about? - You.

151
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,470
当然不是你这一个人
No, not you individually.

152
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,860
是讲适应现代生活的代价
It's more like the price of adaptation on modern life.

153
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,150
各种转型  痛苦
You know, transformation, pain.

154
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,990
你又嗑嗨了吧
How many of those pills have you taken?

155
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,390
没  我说真的
No, seriously.

156
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,590
创造性的破坏
Creative disruption, you know?

157
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,570
你惹别人不开心  但干大事的人都那样
You upset people, but so does anybody who rocks the boat.

158
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,490
同时你也创造了独特的东西
But you also gave birth to some pretty special things.

159
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,680
打一炮再上路
I'm taking one for the road.

160
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,720
搬家工人3点才来
The movers don't get here till 3:00.

161
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,630
乔
Joe.

162
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,450
我可以进去吗
May I?

163
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,850
-爸爸  -宝贝
- Dad. - Hey, sunshine.

164
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,960
抱歉  我邋邋遢遢的
I'm sorry, I'm a mess.

165
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,070
胡说  你这样就很好
Oh, nonsense. You look terrific.

166
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,500
我只是来祝你们一路顺风
I just wanted to wish the happy couple n voyage.

167
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,840
那么
So...

168
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,680
要去西部了  年轻人
go west, young man.

169
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,060
那里前景很广阔呢
Still a wide-open business.

170
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,380
说不定能发展大好  另辟蹊径
Do well, blaze a trail, who knows?

171
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,350
或许西方集团哪天会在那儿开分公司呢
Maybe Westgroup will open an office out there someday.

172
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,760
肯定可以
I have no doubt.

173
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,440
爸  这个真漂亮
Dad, this is beautiful.

174
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,790
谢谢你
Thank you.

175
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,470
你一定会喜欢那里的
Oh, you're gonna love it out there.

176
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,950
那是重新来过之地
It's the land of second chances.

177
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,660
乔  能单独聊聊吗
Joe, may I have a word?

178
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,190
-再见  亲爱的  -再见
- Bye, sweetheart. - Bye.

179
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,660
你不会真以为这套说辞就能封我的口吧
You didn't seriously think that bullshit would buy my silence?

180
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,500
当然
No.

181
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,450
你太意气用事  不会就这么罢休
You're far too emotional for that.

182
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,640
你盗取了别人的知识产权
You stole intellectual property.

183
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,960
事实上  我是先想花钱买的
Actually, I tried to buy it.

184
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,700
而且我记得  开价还不低
A very generous offer, as I recall.

185
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,170
只是那交易不知怎么出了问题
Only the deal went south somehow.

186
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,750
没必要拐弯抹角  是我背着你拆台
No need to dance. I went behind your back.

187
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,140
我建议穆特尼不要卖而且我不后悔
I told Mutiny not to sell and I'm glad.

188
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,850
我对你的看法真是一点没错
Every instinct I had about you was correct,

189
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,890
只是我没看出你会这么卑鄙
except how low you'd stoop.

190
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,920
-说完了吧  -还没呢
- We're done. - Are we?

191
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,640
如果我把此事公诸于众呢
What if I went public?

192
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,120
我是你女婿
I'm your son-in-law.

193
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,040
只要我说对一句话  你的股票就万劫不复了
I string together the right 10 words, your stock's in the toilet.

194
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,310
你不会这么做的
You don't want to do that.

195
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,220
你知道那样的话你想再重新来过会有多难吗
Do you have any idea how hard it's gonna be for you to start over?

196
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,970
没有西方集团  你的简历就是黑历史
Without Westgroup, your resume reads like a rap sheet.

197
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,360
我愿意一试
I'll try my luck.

198
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,400
那莎拉呢  你这么做对她会有多大影响
And Sara? How would your little stunt affect her?

199
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,280
积怨没好处的
There's no upside to grudges.

200
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,780
今天下午来参加股东大会吧
Come to our shareholders' meeting this afternoon.

201
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,590
指望我为你担保
The day I vouch for you...

202
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,210
今天会来很多大人物
There'll be a lot of very important people there.

203
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,870
能影响你未来的大人物
People who can make a difference to your future.

204
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,170
莎拉也会高兴的
Sara will be delighted.

205
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,650
我们可以像朋友那样分别
And we can part friends.

206
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,760
我们不是朋友  是亲人
We're not friends. We're family.

207
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,430
我们每隔一年圣诞节都会见面
We'll see each other at christmas every other year.

208
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,990
我们隔着屋子点头示意
We'll nod to each other across the room,

209
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,570
虚情假意地聊上三刻钟
and after about 45 minutes of fake chit chat and eggnog,

210
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,960
我就找个借口  抱歉还有事  先走了
I'll make an excuse. "We have to be somewhere. I'm so sorry."

211
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,260
等我的孩子问我
And when my children ask me

212
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,880
窗户里那个灰发的陌生人是谁时
who that tall gray stranger in the window is,

213
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,380
我就说一声  那是你外公
I'll remind them, "That's your grandpa."

214
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,980
下午见
I'll see you there.

215
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,020
不  不是双人射击
Oh, no, it's not a two-person shooter,

216
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,570
是双视角射击  所以
it's a two-perspective shooter, so it's--

217
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,970
不  我们确实不兼容那个平台
No, we're not compatible with that platform.

218
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,770
好吧  没有  感谢您抽时间
Okay, no, thank you for your time.

219
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:42,940
再见
Bye.

220
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,280
别来那套了
Hey, cut that out.

221
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,600
什么啊
What?

222
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,260
那副丧气的样子
That down-in-the-mouth crap.

223
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,710
行了  买家听到沮丧的口气
Come on, buyers hear defeat,

224
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,470
肯定退避三舍
they scatter quicker than crawfish at a church boil.

225
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,630
你可是强硬派老大
You're the boss bitch around here.

226
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,860
你是埃及艳后  裙下还有个大金矿
Queen of the nile. Sittin' on a gold mine.

227
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,580
能进来是他们的荣幸才对  懂吗
People be lucky you don't charge admission, get me?

228
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,690
西装笔挺的啊
You look sharp.

229
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,840
那是什么
What's that?

230
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,510
这是...
Oh, this is...

231
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,880
我们的新界面
Our next interface.

232
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,750
看到这些快速链接框了吗
See these quick link boxes?

233
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,190
能将用户跳转到他们感兴趣的内容
They'll kick users right over to their favorite area.

234
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,030
我已经开始写代码了
I've already started coding it.

235
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,940
抱歉  你有话对我说吗
I'm sorry, did you want to talk to me about something?

236
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,910
没  没什么大事
No, nothing important.

237
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,250
-先生  -你好
- Sir? - Oh, yeah, hey.

238
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,340
我在...找我的车
I'm just, uh, looking for my car.

239
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,790
先生  这里仅限员工通行
Sir, this area is for employees only.

240
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,800
没有通行证你不能进来
You can't get in without a pass.

241
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,660
-你有通行证吗  -没有  我...
- Do you have a pass? - No, I, uh...

242
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,030
你记得你停在几楼吗
Do you remember what level you were on?

243
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,930
我没太注意
I wasn't really paying attention.

244
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,950
-也许是五楼  -这儿没有五楼
- Maybe 5F? - There is no 5F.

245
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,760
这里是地下一层西区
This is basement level west.

246
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,520
也许你看见的是东  你停在东五区了吗
Maybe it was an E you saw. Did you park in 5 East?

247
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,350
也许吧
Maybe that's it.

248
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,070
楼梯在那边
Stairwell's right up there.

249
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,120
先生
Sir?

250
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,130
-你没事吧  -没事  没事
- You okay? - Yeah, yeah.

251
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,680
我很好  谢谢
I'm fine, thanks.

252
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,910
这些人是谁
Who are these people?

253
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,430
我打了将近一百通电话
Out of, like, 100 cold calls,

254
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,930
他们是唯一回电话的
they're the ones that called back.

255
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,480
听说他们只成立了几周
Word is they're just a few weeks old.

256
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,640
是啊
Yeah.

257
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,590
西方集团没让步喽
So Westgroup didn't back down?

258
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,850
没  那混蛋对我们的和解协议嗤之以鼻
No, the creep practically blew his nose in our settlement offer.

259
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,220
乔怎么说的
What did Joe say?

260
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,740
他没在
He wasn't there.

261
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,330
我觉得乔不知道西方网络的事
I don't think Joe knew about Westnet.

262
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,810
我觉得也许他说的是真话
I think maybe he was telling us the truth.

263
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,160
好了  可以进来了
Okay, we're ready for you.

264
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,370
实际上  伙计们  今天在这边谈
Oh, actually, guys, we're in here today.

265
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,190
好吧  走吧
Okay, well, here we go.

266
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,180
也许你该去的
Maybe you should go.

267
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,890
去股东大会吗
To the shareholders' meeting?

268
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,970
是啊  他不会料到你会去
Yeah, I mean, he'd never expect it.

269
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,460
他觉得你太骄傲
He thinks you're too proud.

270
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,240
但是想想看
But think about it.

271
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,760
你去参会  站在大家面前
You know, you go there in front of everyone.

272
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,980
让他们知道那是你促成的  你的主意
Let them see that it started with you, your vision.

273
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,280
从这场失败中捞到点好处
Just try and pull something good out of this fiasco.

274
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,080
然后我们把这一切都抛下
Then we can just leave it all behind.

275
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,770
一刀两断
Make a clean break.

276
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,820
你看着办
Look, it's up to you.

277
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,230
无论你怎么做  我都支持你
I'll be by your side either way.

278
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,140
游戏一半内容是间谍主题
So, half the game is a spy thriller.

279
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,030
你的任务是渗透进苏联监狱
Your mission is to infiltrate the soviet prison

280
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,650
拯救挨饿的异见人士  或者...
and rescue the starving dissident or...

281
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,490
你也可以扮演一名克格勃狱卒
You're an elite KGB prison guard.

282
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,830
你的任务是在美国人带着囚犯逃走前
Your orders-- find and shoot the American

283
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,140
找到并杀死他
before he escapes with your prisoner.

284
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,480
每一关都可以选择扮演渗透方或者营救方
So each level can be played as either hide or seek.

285
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,220
打破我们对于冷战的偏见
While totally scrambling our cold war preconceptions.

286
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,590
嗯  就像《高尔基公园》混搭《天狐入侵》
Right, it's like "Gorky Park" meets "Red Dawn."

287
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,890
前提是我们可以移植代码
If we can port the code.

288
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,800
图像方面  它没有理由
Graphically, there's no reason

289
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,710
不能在卡带主机上运行
it can't run off a cartridge.

290
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,220
但如果不是双人玩家
But without the live two-player aspect,

291
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,240
-它不就是个监狱版《战区》吗  -不
- isn't it just "Battlezone" in a prison? - No.

292
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,970
不  我们认为游戏的紧张感
No, we like to think that the tension

293
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,700
和幽闭感使它区别于其他游戏
and the claustrophobia really set it apart.

294
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,480
酷  太酷了
Cool. It's definitely cool.

295
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,950
布莱斯  泡几杯咖啡
Bryce, a couple of coffees?

296
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,030
稍等  伙计们
Um, one second, guys.

297
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,800
-借过一下  -好的
- I gotta just go that way. - Oh, sure.

298
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,680
概念上说  你们的东西很棒
Look, conceptually, it's really strong.

299
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,010
只可惜我们付不起你们的开发成本
I just wish we could cover your development costs.

300
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:09,590
你们的报价  超出我们的承受范围了
What you're asking, it's kind of out of our price range.

301
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,680
这个...
well, uh...

302
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,630
轻松一刻游戏公司
Funtime Games.

303
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,090
我觉得我们应该离开这里
Look, I think we should just get out of here.

304
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,440
先等等
Sit tight.

305
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,980
几位好
Hey there.

306
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,010
我是约翰·博斯沃思  来自穆特尼
John Bosworth, Mutiny, inc.

307
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,240
布莱斯  能让我们单独谈谈吗
Bryce, could you excuse us?

308
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,490
我看看
Let's see.

309
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,160
你们的总部在雷蒙德[华盛顿州]啊
Looks like you're headquartered up in Redmond.

310
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,940
这是什么  销售网吗
What is this? Distribution network?

311
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,350
-那是机密  -覆盖全国呐
- That's confidential. - That's nationwide, mm-mm.

312
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,800
背后金主肯定不小
Gents must have some serious backers.

313
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,540
博斯沃思先生  我得...
Mr. Bosworth, I'm gonna have to insist--

314
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,090
我完全不想
Oh, hell, I got no interest

315
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,900
搞砸你们的宏伟计划  无论是什么
in blowin' your grand plans, whatever they are.

316
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,540
这是个自由的国家嘛
Yeah, it's a free country.

317
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,750
但有几件事想说
Couple things, though.

318
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,470
首先  你们没必要冷落我们
One, well, there ain't no need to cold-room us

319
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,820
让一个菜鸟来跟我们压价
with the toddlers just to drive down our price.

320
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,930
我们是讲道理的人
Hell, we're reasonable people.

321
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,240
第二  在友邦旗帜下
Two, it's a lot easier to

322
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,510
建立滩头堡要容易得多
establish a beachhead under a friendly flag.

323
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,560
你们觉得丰田为什么
Why do you think Toyota's

324
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,930
现在要在菲蒙市造汽车而不是在富士什么地方
building cars in Fremont rather than Fuji-what-now?

325
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,870
原因就四个字  美国制造
Well, four little words-- made in the U.S.A.

326
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,170
你们的合伙人  如果他们推出的产品
Your partners, say they land their product

327
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,160
全装着日本游戏
with strictly Japanese games--

328
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,370
他们雇你们重新命名包装
ones they hire you to retitle and repackage--

329
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,720
听起来有点鬼鬼祟祟  是吧
Man, that sounds kind of sneaky, huh?

330
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,390
有点像入侵
Kind of like an invasion.

331
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,030
可如果他们搭载点当地的东西
But say they ship some homegrown titles,

332
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,690
美国开发的东西
ones they developed on these shores.

333
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,160
那就皆大欢喜了
Boy, that's kumbaya time.

334
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,470
把手伸过大洋
Hands across the ocean.

335
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,880
就算只为公关价值也该买
Might be worth acquiring for the pr value alone.

336
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,850
而且  还显得你们聪明  时尚
Hell, it'll also make you look smart, out ahead of the curve.

337
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,170
听听我们要说的
Hear us out.

338
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,710
你们不会后悔的
You ain't gonna regret it.

339
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,560
我们卖掉了
We sold it.

340
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,380
那下一步怎么办  他们什么时候付钱
So, then, what's next? When do we get paid?

341
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,860
-谁买的  -多少钱
- Who made the purchase? - How much?

342
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,530
-5万  -5万
- 50 grand. - 50 grand?

343
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,110
足够雇家新网络了
Enough to hire a new network

344
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,950
我们还会发一轮工资
and we will make payroll.

345
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,910
-穆特尼  穆特尼  -干什么
- Mutiny! Mutiny! - What?

346
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,000
-穆特尼  穆特尼  -好吧
- Mutiny! Mutiny! - Okay, okay, okay.

347
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:56,310
穆特尼  穆特尼
Mutiny! Mutiny!

348
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,010
天啊
Jesus.

349
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,240
有人吗
Hello!

350
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,490
有人吗
Hello!

351
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,520
恭喜
Congratulations.

352
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,460
谢谢
Thanks.

353
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,460
肯定很难过吧
Must've been hard, right?

354
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,630
其实没有
No, actually.

355
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,010
我感觉轻松了
I feel lighter.

356
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,660
比之前一段时间思路清晰多了
I feel clearer than I've been in a while.

357
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,760
那是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

358
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:29,560
公司想要成功  我就得百分百专注
Look, if this company's gonna survive, it needs me 100% focused.

359
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,530
-我们之间的事...  -你是说咱俩的关系
- What we've been doing-- - You mean our relationship?

360
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,620
对
Yeah.

361
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:38,920
我太过满足  幸福了
I got too complacent and happy.

362
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,720
我放下了防卫  导致我们受了损失
I let my guard down and it cost us.

363
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,020
幸福不是什么副作用
Happiness is not some side effect.

364
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,950
-它是人生的全部意义  -好吧
- It's kind of the whole point. - Okay.

365
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,990
我不是在怪你
I'm not blaming you.

366
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,680
我是在承担责任
I'm taking responsibility.

367
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,150
这是我造成的
I made this happen.

368
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,790
其实  我觉得这是乔造成的
Actually, I think Joe is making this happen,

369
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,590
我觉得你就是翻不过篇
and I think you can't get over it.

370
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,230
或许你一直都没有
Maybe you never have.

371
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,920
你利用了我
You used me.

372
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,150
你让我相信了我们所做的事
You made me believe in what we were doing here.

373
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,440
知道吗
You know...

374
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,490
你比自己想的更像他
You're a lot more like him than you think.

375
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,940
可以让我单独待会儿吗
Do you mind?

376
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,610
需要帮忙吗
Need help with that?

377
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,890
这是技术活儿
It's technical.

378
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,230
在董事会面前做主讲
Keynote in front of the board,

379
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,690
好个结婚礼物
that's quite the wedding gift.

380
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,150
帮帮忙  自己滚下台  省得我把你丢下去
Do me a favor, get off the stage before I throw you off.

381
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,430
对了  有个记者找你
By the way, a reporter wants a word with you.

382
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,010
说是你的老朋友
She says she's an old friend.

383
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,690
你是来当着几百人羞辱我的吗
I assume you're here to humiliate me in front of hundreds of people?

384
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,150
真想啊
Tempting.

385
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,010
但是不  这已经没必要了
But, no, I guess that's no longer necessary.

386
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,220
是啊  我要走了
Yeah. I'm done.

387
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,390
我的生活一完蛋
I guess when my life goes up in a mushroom cloud,

388
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:56,620
我就会自然而然认为是你干的
I just naturally assume you're behind it somehow.

389
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,720
习惯了嘛
Old habits.

390
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,360
你要走了
You leaving town?

391
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,520
是啊
That's right.

392
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,220
跟你未婚妻吗
With your fiancée?

393
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,340
其实  我们已经结婚了
Wife, actually.

394
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,560
去加州本来是我的主意
Going to California was my idea.

395
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,130
记得吗
Remember?

396
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,140
在计算机分销商展览上
At comdex.

397
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,360
我差点被你说动了
You almost convinced me.

398
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,820
有个跟我亲近的人说  你依然在我的生活中
Someone close to me said that there must be a reason

399
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,150
这一定是有原因的
why you're still a part of my life.

400
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,040
你想过吗
Do you ever wonder?

401
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,360
如果
I mean, what if

402
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,720
我们不是
instead of

403
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,940
分开执迷地追逐
chasing what each of us wanted

404
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,260
各自想要的东西
separately and obsessively...

405
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,670
而是抓住彼此会怎样
We just held on to each other instead?

406
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,800
我知道你没抄袭我们的界面
I know you didn't copy our interface.

407
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,330
我知道那事不怪你
I know it wasn't your fault.

408
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:26,190
我希望你走前能听到我说这话
I didn't want you to leave without hearing that.

409
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,080
还有
And...

410
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,200
我一定是完全疯了  因为我心里有一部分
I must be totally mental, because part of me

411
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,060
根本不希望你走
doesn't want you to go away at all.

412
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,200
你根本不知道
You have no idea...

413
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,530
卡梅伦  我不能这样
Cameron, I can't do this.

414
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,260
不
No.

415
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,680
你是乔·麦克米伦  你想做什么都行

这是通往新世界的道路

All this...

456
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,700
这一切都始于一个很有才华的

这不是我建造的  不是我所有的
I didn't build this. I don't own it,

460
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,340
它也不属于这里任何人
and neither does anyone here.

461
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,130
如果我们对此一笔带过  我们就是在摧残
If we skate past that, we're doing violence to the one thing,

462
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:16,850
这行或许唯一神圣的东西  原创性
maybe the only sacred thing in our business... innovation.

463
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,120
卡梅伦今天不能到场
Cameron couldn't be here today,

464
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,660
但她的天才却无处不在
but her genius is all around us.

我相信  在今后几年中都会如此
And will be, I suspect, for years to come.

然后放我出院

533
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,360
你拿到果汁了

- Just a moment? - Yeah.

536
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,950
抱歉  戈登告诉我他的病情在控制之中
I'm so sorry. Gordon told me his cte was under control.

537
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:16,200
是的  我们上周做过核磁共振
It is. We did an mri last week.

538
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,100
病情没有加重
The disease hasn't progressed.

539
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,620
那我就不懂了
Then I don't understand.

540
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,290
这次发作并非是病症
This episode was not symptomatic.

541
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,570
是心理问题
It was psychological.

542
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,790
他脱水  迷路了
He was dehydrated. He got lost.

医护人员说他在救护车里崩溃了
The paramedics said that he broke down in the ambulance.

545
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,890
他跟你说了吗
Did he mention that to you?

546
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,110
重症确诊有时候会使潜在问题浮出水面
A serious diagnosis can sometimes bring out underlying problems.

547
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:48,530
戈登过去有过狂暴行为
Has Gordon ever experienced manic behavior

548
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,660
或偏执症吗
or paranoia in the past?

549
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,760
这么严重啊
That bad, huh?

550
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,620

你今晚恐怕不能回家了
I don't think you're gonna get to come home tonight.

552

赛摩尔医生认为  我也认同
Dr. Semel thinks, and I believe him,

553
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,060
情况可能不像我们说的那么简单
that this goes beyond what we talked about.

00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,850
我需要帮助
I need help.

556
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:28,000
我被下了套  她给我搞了破坏
I was set up. She sabotaged me.

557
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:32,220
天呐  你听到自己在怎么解释了吗
Christ, can you even hear your own rationalizations anymore?

558
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,910
我受够了别人的怀疑
You know, I'm getting tired of being second-guessed

559
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:37,090
摆布和不信任
and manipulated and distrusted

560
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:39,620
我没做错任何事
when I have done absolutely nothing wrong.

561
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,520
我凭什么要相信你
Well, why should I believe a word you say?

562
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,550
因为你是我老婆
Because you're my goddamn wife!

563
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,410
我不管你对我爸做了什么
I don't care about what you did to my dad.

564
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,310
你俩就是一丘之貉
You two deserve each other.

565
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,610
而是你那么做的原因
It's why you did it.

566
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,920
这么久以来
All this time,

567
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,030
我以为你是受自己的天才所累
I thought that you were a victim of your genius,

568
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,440
是不被看好的预言者
some sidetracked prophet...

569
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,570
而我是你的第二次机会
and that I was your second chance.

570
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:19,260
但你不是  对吗  乔
But you're not, are you, Joe?

571
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,800
你就是个意外
You're an accident.

572
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,490
你是别人不该遭遇的不幸
You're something that happens to people who deserve better.

573
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,470
我不是个意外
I'm not an accident.

574
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,120
我该拥有更好的
I deserve better.

575
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,060
我该拥有你
I deserve you.

576
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:03,660
我真希望你知道这是什么感觉
I just wish that you knew what this felt like.

577
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,950
希望你能看到你说出她名字时自己的脸
That you could just see your face when you say her name.

578
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,160
说啊  乔
Say it, Joe.

579
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,030
说卡梅伦
Say Cameron.

580
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,410
天呐  你太迷失了
God, you're lost.

581
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,120
我们要你们能拿出来的一切
We'll take anything you can give us...

582
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,660
编程笔记  各关卡布局
programming notes, level layouts.

583
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,390
嗯  我都打包
Yeah, okay, I'll pack it up

584
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,020
明天叫人送去
and have someone drop it off tomorrow.

585
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:53,740
谢了  我知道放弃自己的孩子不容易
Thanks. I know it's not easy letting go of your baby.

586
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,080
嗯  你们怎么打算的
Yeah, so what's your plan?

587
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,930
你们找到发布平台了吗
Did you guys find a platform to launch it on?

588
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:02,260
嗯  我们有人选了
Yeah, I think we've got someone in mind.

589
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:04,540
但名字估计得改
Probably have to change the name, though.

590
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,710
《营救保卫战》  这是你还是汤姆的主意啊
"Extract & defend," Was that your idea or Tom's?

591
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,700
-什么  -汤姆·兰顿  他好有才
- What? - Tom Rendon. He's so talented.

592
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,030
我们还想挖他的墙角
Tried to poach him from you guys,

593
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,720
但他说他更想单飞
but he said he'd rather go it alone.

594
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,880
你看过他克隆的《视差》吧
You've seen his "Parallax" clone, right?

595
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,940
太有才了
Genius.

596
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,870
你认识他啊
Do you know him?

597
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,730
我们切磋交流好几年了
Yeah, we've been trading hacks for years.

598
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,630
你以为我们怎么知道你们的
How do you think we found out about you?

599
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,020
是他告诉我们的
He tipped us off.

600
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,720
我不肯跟你们见面简直就不放过我了
Practically broke my arm till I took the meeting.

601
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,080
喂
Hello?

602
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,600
你为什么不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

603
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:39,220
有什么好说的  你已经拿定主意了
What was there to say? You already made your decision.

604
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,450
等等
Wait.

605
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,370
汤姆  站住
Tom, stop.

606
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,210
站住
Stop!

607
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,520
你会回来的
You'll come back.

608
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,650
你明早醒来
You'll wake up tomorrow morning

609
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:59,240
骑着你的破自行车过来
and you'll ride your stupid bike back here

610
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,480
我煮咖啡  你倒你的提子麦片
and I'll make coffee and you'll pour your raisin bran

611
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,310
我们再想个新东西出来
and we'll just come up with something new.

612
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,050
等等
Wait.

613
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,200
如果没有你  我是做不到的
I couldn't have done any of this without you!

614
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,330
不  卡梅伦
No, Cameron.

615
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,520
这事完全是你一个人做的
You did this all by yourself.

-戈登  -0.28分
- Gordon? - Uh, ahem, 0.28.

142
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,760
很低啊  这周很顺心吧
That's pretty low. Must've been a good week.

143
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,020
是啊  也没什么好说的
Yeah, nothing to report.

144
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,560
我就待在家里  按时吃药
I'm home, taking my medication.

145
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,590
孩子们都上学去了  所以
Kids are headed back to school, so...

146
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,000
那你这0.28分是打给哪件事的呢
What registered the .28 of stress?

147
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,550
我的眼镜找不到了
Oh, uh, I couldn't find my glasses.

148
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,920
还有别的事吗
Anything else come to mind?

149
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,150
有没有什么事你忘了记下来了
Something you might've failed to capture in your journal?

150
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,440
没有
Nope.

151
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,370
就眼镜这一件事  布伦顿
Just seeing the glasses thing here, Brendan.

152
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,390
好吧
Okay, well...

153
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,960
既然你就这一件事  那我们就说说这件事吧
Since that's all we've got, that's what we'll workshop.

154
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,780
你不妨把你的压力给我们情景再现一下
Why don't you role-play your stress for us?

155
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,790
好啊
Sure.

156
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,930
我醒过来  就想着
I woke up and I thought...

157
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,660
"我眼镜哪去了"
"Where are my glasses?"

158
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,120
然后我找到了  我说
And then I found them and I said...

159
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,200
"在这儿呢"
"Here they are."

160
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,230
不  请站起来
No, let's get you on your feet.

161
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,710
我想请你在中间
I'd like to see you act it out

162
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,930
把当时的情况演出来
in the center of the group.

163
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,480
来  把眼镜摘下来
Here, why don't you take them off

164
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,200
我帮你拿着  你来找
and I'll hold them while you look for them?

165
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,760
好  现在是早上
Okay, it's the morning.

166
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:55,960
你刚刚醒来  可是找不到眼镜了
You just woke up, but can't find your glasses.

167
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,020
开始
Go.

168
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,150
不
Oh, no.

169
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,130
我找不到眼镜了
I can't find my glasses.

170
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,810
眼镜哪去了
Where are they?

171
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,380
我再也看不到东西了
I'm never gonna be able to see again.

172
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:13,430
我瞎了  不
I'm blind. Oh, no.

173
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,750
与其描述情况
Rather than caption what's happening,

174
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,120
你不如跟大家讲一下自己的感受
why don't you tell us how you're feeling?

175
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,990
我现在觉得是在浪费时间
Right now I feel like I'm wasting my time.

176
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,140
丢了眼镜你有什么感觉
How do you feel about losing your glasses?

177
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,220
我找不到它  气得发狂
I'm mad that I can't find them.

178
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,070
还有呢
What else?

179
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,240
我...我很沮丧
I'm, uh-- I'm frustrated

180
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,220
很担心
and I'm-- I'm worried.

181
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,250
为什么担心
Why are you worried?

182
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,240
因为我都找了好几分钟了
Because it's been a few minutes

183
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,910
我担心眼镜丢了
and I'm worried that I lost them

184
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,330
说不清
and, I don't know,

185
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,870
我记不清把它放哪了
I can't remember where they are,

186
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,190
是我忘了
and is this just me forgetting

187
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,870
还是别的什么
or is this something more?

188
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,280
你的病情可能会加重让你害怕吗
Does it scare you that your illness might progress?

189
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:57,440
不
No.

190
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,480
因为它就在厨房台面上
'Cause they were on the damn kitchen counter.

191
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,810
花生酱哪去了
Where is the peanut butter?

192
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,160
爸爸给放上面了
Daddy keeps it up there.

193
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,430
我的华夫饼没热透
My eggo's still cold in the middle.

194
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,250
你还放了一堆糖浆呢
Well, it's also drowning in syrup,

195
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,200
这也算弥补了不足
so maybe that makes up for it.

196
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,460
你干什么
Excuse me!

197
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,330
你这是什么态度
What kind of behavior is that?

198
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,520
为什么不让爸爸做早餐  你做饭难吃死了
Why can't daddy make breakfast? You suck at this.

199
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,960
琼妮·玛丽
Joanie Marie!

200
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,240
我们都心齐一点  好吗
We all need to work together, okay?

201
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,490
你爸爸有点心烦
Your dad got a little upset.

202
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,510
-像在加州时那样吗  -闭嘴  蠢货
- Like in California? - Shut up, stupid.

203
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,930
不许骂人
Hey, no name-calling.

204
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,350
加州发生什么事了
What happened in California?

205
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,440
没什么
Nothing.

206
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,120
琼妮
Joanie?

207
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,190
爸爸和亨利叔叔吵架了
Daddy and uncle Henry got into a yelling fight,

208
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,040
我们三个只好睡破旅馆
and the three of us had to sleep in a crummy motel.

209
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,060
你们为什么不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

210
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,480
如果告诉你  你和爸爸也会吵架的
Because then you and daddy would fight like him and uncle Henry.

211
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,880
他们吵什么
Oh, what was the fight about?

212
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,900
琼妮
Joanie.

213
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,970
没事吧
Everything okay?

214
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,780
没事  琼妮对早餐不满意
Yeah, uh, Joanie didn't like her breakfast.

215
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,940
橙汁喝完了
We're out of orange juice.

216
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,950
咖啡也没了
And there's no coffee.

217
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,630
没事  亲爱的
It's okay, sweetheart.

218
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,480
接待处
Reception.

219
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,250
我这就告诉他
I'll let him know.

220
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,170
麦克米伦先生  可以进去了
Mr. Macmillan, they're ready.

221
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,590
{\pos(160.4,151.621)}{\an9}斯托克斯          资本

222
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,920
没错  我们见过穆特尼
Yeah, we had Mutiny in here,

223
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,040
老实说  从一开始我对他们就持观望态度
but frankly I was on the fence about them from the get-go.

224
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,140
听说他们最近做得很好
And I heard they're doing pretty well recently.

225
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,130
我说那是瞎猫遇上死耗子
I'm chalking that up to dumb luck.

226
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,390
穆特尼虽然不是万灵药
Mutiny certainly isn't the answer to anything,

227
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,410
但这个萌芽阶段的线上社区
But I will say this burgeoning online sector

228
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,650
是现在科技界的潮流
is the place to be in technology right now.

229
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,070
你想说什么
Do you have something in mind?

230
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,430
对达拉斯的人  穆特尼就足够了
Mutiny's fine if I live in Dallas,

231
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,470
但如果我想接触到
but what if I want to access information

232
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,610
多伦多  旧金山  东京的资讯呢
in Toronto, San Francisco, Tokyo?

233
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,580
假如我住在没有网络的内布拉斯加乡村呢
What if I live in rural Nebraska where there is no service?

234
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:36,150
你打算做奥马哈市在线服务第一人吗
So, what, you want to do the first online service in Omaha?

235
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,070
奥马哈只是随口说的地方
Omaha is just a place on the map.

236
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,940
我想让地域不再成为制约因素
I'm trying to make maps irrelevant.

237
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,170
这项服务让客户可从一个地方拨入
This service allows customers to dial in from one location

238
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,880
而从另一座城市的银行拨出
and dial out from banks in a completely different city.

239
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,570
这样就避免了长途费用
Something like this sidesteps long-distance fees.

240
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,490
我得叫你打住了
I'm gonna stop you right there.

241
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,590
是你把西方集团带进技术领域的  对吧
Now, you brought Westgroup into tech recently, right?

242
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,930
西方网络  那些东西
Westnet? All that?

243
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,060
我让西方集团转型去做分时
I transitioned Westgroup into time-sharing

244
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,900
帮他们打开了潜在的被动收入源
and helped them realize a dormant passive income stream.

245
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,080
那你怎么又毁了这一切
So why did you torch it?

246
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,420
-我没有  -跟我听说的可不一样
- I didn't. - No, that's not what I heard.

247
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,060
我老实说吧
Here's the honest truth.

248
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,260
我们一个子都不会给你
We don't have a dime for ya.

249
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,430
这次会面只是出于病态的好奇心
We took this meeting out of morbid curiosity.

250
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,640
媒体的说法是  维勒进军技术领域搞砸了
Now, the press story is that Wheeler botched the tech move,

251
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,180
但我认识的内部人员
but I know some guys on the inside over there

252
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,720
跟我讲了真实情况
who told me the real story,

253
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,900
而我只想知道
and what I want to know is...

254
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,830
为什么
Why?

255
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,490
以及如何做到的
Also how?

256
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,300
是个破坏程序  对吧
Some destructive program? Right?

257
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,060
病毒什么的
A virus or something?

258
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,200
我调查过你  你在卡迪夫的时候...
You know, I looked into you, what you did at Cardiff...

259
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,690
在德马湖畔烧毁了100台电脑
immolating 100 computers out by Lake Texoma.

260
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,870
真是的
Holy shit.

261
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,770
我真是震惊了
I am blown away.

262
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,510
我还从没见过一个真正的精神变态呢
I've never met a legitimate psychopath before.

263
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,620
应该买下来
We should buy this.

264
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,730
IBM 3033主机  需要翻修
IBM 3033 mainframe. It's a refurbish job.

265
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,810
需要点呵护  但这就是我们的了
It needs a little love, but then we'd own it.

266
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,810
-再不需要找网络搭档  -卡梅伦...
- No more network partners. - Cameron...

267
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,240
你猜怎么找到的
You know where I found this?

268
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,730
社区
Community.

269
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,960
我进了技术聊天室
I went into the tech talk room,

270
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,870
说明了需要的规格
I wrote out the specs we'd need,

271
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,050
一下子穆特尼就有了100位一线特工
and suddenly I had 100 Mutiny field agents on it.

272
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,430
两天之内就找到了
They found this thing in two days.

273
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,790
这台机器已经10年了  用的是磁带驱动设备
This machine is 10 years old. It uses tape drives--

274
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,730
-我们...  -也没有控制器
- Which we... - Control unit is missing.

275
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,070
即使它不在加州戴利城
And even if it wasn't in Daly City, California,

276
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,950
这个报价也是我们所有流动资金
this is all of our liquid cash

277
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,220
加上明年预期收入的大部分的总和
plus most of our projected income for the next year,

278
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,010
还不算运费
and that's before shipping.

279
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,760
即使我们把它买下运过来
And even if we could get it on a truck to move it out here,

280
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,530
又能搁哪呢
where would we put it?

281
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,210
没错  挑战不小
Yes, there are challenges, sure,

282
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,070
但我们需要往...
but we need to start moving in a...

00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,790
如果你想开潜水艇  先得加入海军
If you want to drive a submarine, you gotta join the navy.

284
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,850
虽然有时候你得向别人敬礼
Yeah, you might have to salute somebody every once in a while,

285
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,550
但是...
but I--

286
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,720
这总比买一艘会让你沉入海底的
it's better than buying a rickety old diesel boat

287
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,430
破烂柴油机船好
that sinks you to the bottom of the ocean.

288
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,070
这太勉强了  即使是对我们
This is a reach, even for us.

289
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,520
好吧
Okay.

290

I rang the doorbell, but then I heard the music, so...

292
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,680
你看上去挺忙的  我...
I see you're busy. I'll--

293
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,590
不不  我只是在试用蒸汽驱动的CPU
No, no, I'm just trying out a steam-powered CPU.

294
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,750
听着  我知道这情景看上去怎样
Look, I know what this looks like--

295
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,690
像是疯子和他的幼稚玩具被扔在后院
like they parked the loony bird out back with his kiddy toys,

296
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:30,230
但我告诉你  这些不仅仅是玩具
but I'll have you know that these aren't just toys.

297
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,410
这是个铁路运输模型
This is rail transport modeling.

我还在卡迪夫时买的
I got this back when I was at Cardiff.

299
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,150
只是一直抽不出时间摆弄
I just never got around to it.

300
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,370
发生什么事了
What's going on?

301
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,510
我只是过来
I, uh-- I just came by

302
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,680
给你点东西
to give you something.

303
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,600
这是什么  可编程只读存储器吗
What is this, a prom?

304
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,120
是我们逆向工程的那台电脑上的
It's from the one we reverse engineered.

305
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,160
你还留着它
You saved this.

306
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,670
我一直把它当自己的试金石留着
I've always kept it as kind of a private touchstone.

307
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,740
在困难时期激励自己
Nice to have when times are tough.

308
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,030
听上去有点傻  但是
Sounds stupid, but...

309
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,040
它一直是我前进的动力
It always kept me going.

310
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,830
或许你该留着它
Maybe you should hold on to it.

311
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,020
那些事仿佛就在昨天  对吧
Boy, it seems like yesterday, doesn't it?

312
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,050
是啊  简直恍如隔世
Yeah, it seems like forever ago.

313
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,690
听着  我听说西方集团的事了
Look, I heard about what happened at Westgroup,

314
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,000
如果我能帮上什么忙的话...
and if there's anything I can do to help...

315
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,200
主机也许有办法修好

搞砸了穆特尼之后

317
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,050
我研究了索纳里斯的代码
I tooled around with the Sonaris code,

318
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,820
想试试能否逆转其损害
tried to see if there was any way to reverse it.

319
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,080
你看上去不错
You look good.

320
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,270
我很高兴
I'm glad.

321
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,220
你和莎拉怎么样
W-what about you and sara?

322
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,880
照顾好自己  戈登

约翰逊城有家公司要出售3081主机
There's a company off LBJ that's letting go of their 3081.

324
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,240

That sounds promising.

325
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,290
一百万
For a million bucks.

326
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,070
我就知道他是个疯子
I knew he was crazy!

327
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,920
兰顿走回那女孩面前  说道
So, Rendon walks back up to this girl and he goes,

328
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,250
"你大可以再拔一次自动点唱机的插头
"Look, you can unplug the jukebox again if you want to,

329
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,690
但我知道你内心深处
but I know that deep down inside

330
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:16,980
是喜欢汤姆·佩蒂[美国歌手]的
you like Tom Petty,

331
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,580
因为这酒吧里的每个人

00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,230
不  整个美国都爱汤姆·佩蒂

333
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,710
你意识到这点只是早晚的事"
and it's only a matter of time before you realize that."

334
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,320
汤姆·兰顿和女人杀手啊

335
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,490
你该给他打电话

336
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,600
天哪
Jesus.

我一直希望我有个发明能名留青史
I always hoped one of my inventions would go down in history.

350
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,880
只是没料到会是个电脑病毒
I just never knew it was gonna be a goddamn computer virus.

351
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,180
我们能谈谈别的吗
Let's talk about something else, huh?

352
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,560
乔今天来过
Joe stopped by today.

353
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,240
我不是说乔
I didn't mean Joe.

354
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,160
他看上去糟透了
He looked like hell.

355
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,270
我觉得他过得好像不太好
I don't think he's doing well.

356
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,800
那我很遗憾
I'm sorry to hear that.

357
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,610
他来是为了把我们逆向工程的
You know, he stopped by to give me the prom chip

358
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,460
IBM机可编程只读存储器芯片给我
from the IBM we reverse engineered.

359
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,330
他一直留着呢
He had saved it.

360
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,030
我从没见过他那样
I've never seen him like this.

361
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,430
我觉得他会做什么  孤注一掷的事
I feel like he could do something...something desperate.

362
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,290
就因为卡梅伦对他做的事
All because of what Cameron did to him.

363
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,320
你不觉得恶心吗
Doesn't that disgust you?

364
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,840
哪怕就一点点
I mean, even just a little bit?

365
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,100
我觉得你这么激动
You know, I don't think it's a good idea

366
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,180
可没什么好处
for you to get so worked up like this.

367
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,370
你清楚医嘱的
You know what the doctor said.

368
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,050
她毁了他的整个生活
She destroyed his entire life,

369
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,170
为什么  因为他试图帮她吗
and for what, because he tried to help her?

370
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,180
听上去你只相信
Well, it sounds like you're just

371
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,590
乔那个版本的故事是吧
going with Joe's version of events, then.

372
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,020
因为我觉得他说的是真话
Because I think he's telling the truth.

373
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,770
你还记得他是个什么样的合伙人吗
Do you remember what kind of a partner he is?

374
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,420
你去年和他合作的时候
When you were in business with him last year,

375
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,700
你说他做的那些事呢
all the things that you accused him of?

376
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,910
-但这不一样  -为什么
- But this is different. - Why?

377
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,590
为什么现在不一样了
Why is it different now?

378
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,350
当我经历了和你相同的事
Now suddenly when I experience the exact same thing you do,

379
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,020
乔就突然是好人了吗  为什么他是受害者
Joe is a nice guy? Why is he the victim?

380
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,210
乔也许不是这世界上最值得信任的人
Joe might not be the most trustworthy person in the world,

381
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,870
但卡梅伦对他做的事是最...
but what Cameron did to him is the most...

382
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,010
是我们做的
We did it.

383
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,240
给他那个病毒
Giving him the virus--

384
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,260
是我们的主意  卡梅伦和我的
It was our idea, Cameron's and mine.

385
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,460
你知道他当时要离开西方集团了
You knew he was leaving Westgroup.

386
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,240
-我告诉你了  -对
- I told you that. - Yeah.

387
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,430
他怎么会和西方网络有任何关系呢
Why would he have anything to do with WestNet?

388
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,010
他一只脚都踏进加州了
He already had one foot in California.

389
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,250
事实是  这不重要
The truth is, it doesn't matter.

390
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,800
-你什么意思  -他不是好东西
- What do you mean it... - He's toxic.

391
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,080
你和我一样清楚这点
You know that as well as I do.

392
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,850
-什么  -上个月你还那么担心
- What? - Last month when you were so worried

393
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,790
有人剽窃了你的创意
that someone was stealing your idea,

394
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,670
这事真的发生在我身上了
well, that actually happened to me.

395
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,760
-而且不是我的想象  -你是谁啊
- It wasn't just in my head. - Who are you?

396
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,510
我简直都不认识你了
It's like I don't even know you anymore.

397
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,010
-这整整一年来  -我是谁
- I mean, this entire year-- - Who am I?

398
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,760
你得了重病居然瞒了我近两个月
You kept a serious illness from me for nearly two months.

399
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,960
说真的  我都不知道
Frankly, I don't know how

400
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,400
在这事上你对自己又有多诚实
honest you're being with yourself about it

401
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,500
因为这些日子来你简直都失控了
considering how out of control you've been.

402
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,360
-我已经尽力在应对了  -是吗
- I am doing my best to deal with this, okay? - Oh, yeah.

403
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,220
我在吃药  参加互助会
I'm taking the pills, I'm going to group.

404
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,960
-你根本就把互助会当玩笑  -我已经
- Which you think is a joke. - I'm doing the--

405
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,960
-什么  -我看到你拿它开玩笑来着
- What? - I saw you there making fun of it.

406
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,530
你根本就没有认真做
You were not even trying.

407
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,940
连心理治疗你都监视我吗
So you're spying on me in therapy?

408
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,340
真难以置信  唐娜
Unbelievable, Donna.

409
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,080
没错  因为你有事瞒我
Yeah, because you keep things from me.

410
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,600
我觉得现在是我们都有事瞒着对方
Well, it sounds like to me we're keeping things from each other.

411
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,360
既然说到了秘密
Well, while we're on the topic of secrets...

412
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,130
那我问你在加州发生了什么事
I would like to know what happened in California.

413
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,880
琼妮跟我说你和亨利大吵了一架
Joanie told me that you and Henry got in a shouting match

414
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,790
严重到你得带着女儿们去旅馆住
that was apparently so bad you had to take the girls to a motel.

415
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,350
你为什么不告诉我
Why would you not tell me that?

416
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,480
因为  唐娜  我出轨了
Because, Donna, I had an affair!

417
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,450
什么
What?

418
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,470
就一晚上  毫无意义的
It was one night. It was meaningless.

419
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,260
完全是件蠢事
It was absolutely stupid.

420
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,220
我后悔吗
Do I regret it?

421
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,090
后悔  每一分每一秒
Yeah, every minute of every day.

422
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,740
当我发现自己病了
When I found out I was sick,

423
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,080
我想在婚姻中找到精神支柱
I looked around for my marriage

424
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,100
但我找不到
and it wasn't there.

425
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,350
你不在我身边
You weren't there.

426
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,530
也许
Maybe--

427
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,700
也许我们的婚姻早已出现问题
Maybe this has been broken for a long time,

428
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,190
只有我们俩还不自知
and we're the only ones who don't know it.

429
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,070
琼妮
Joanie.

430
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,410
琼妮  宝贝
Joanie, sweetheart.

431
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,980
你今天来得好早
You're here early.

432
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,470
我已经不知道我和戈登是否还相爱
I don't know that gordon and I love each other anymore.

433
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,390
我也不知道
And I don't know--

434
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,660
我们还能不能和好如初
I don't know if we can fix it.

435
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,790
我甚至都不知道自己还想不想跟他和好
And I don't even know if I wanna fix it.

436
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,420
这事我不是很懂  婚姻的事
I don't know what it's like-- um, marriage.

437
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,720
结婚什么样  这种事
Being married, it's--

438
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,820
我不清楚  我也不想装懂
I don't know, I won't pretend to understand.

439
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:19,480
你和戈登拥有的  或者曾经拥有的
What you and Gordon have, or don't,

440
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,870
那是只有你们俩自己能想明白的
um, I mean, that's something only you two can figure out.

441
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,780
但我知道
I do know

442
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,770
有的时候
that once in a while, you know,

443
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,980
生活会给出些征兆
life can give us a sign...

444
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,390
为我们指出新的方向
point us to a different place,

445
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,700
让我们因祸得福
make good things come out of bad.

446
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,680
如果没有卡迪夫电子
If it weren't for Cardiff Electric,

447
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,000
也绝不会有穆特尼
there would've never been a Mutiny, and...

448
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,630
如果没有戈登·克拉克
You know, if it weren't for Gordon Clark,

449
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,210
我也不会认识你了
I would've never met you.

450
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,120
我真的不想再增加你的痛苦了
Listen, I don't want to add to your misery here,

451
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,910
但是咖啡机坏掉了
but the coffeemaker is broken,

452
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,390
所以
so...

453
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,320
我觉得我们应该搬去加州
I think we should move to California.

454
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,870
你看
Here.

455
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,420
柴油潜艇
The diesel sub.

456
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,930
如果我们无法把主机运来穆特尼
Look, if we can't bring the mainframe to Mutiny,

457
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,670
也许我们该把穆特尼搬去主机那里
maybe we bring Mutiny to the mainframe.

458
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,630
我觉得这是生活给我们的征兆
I think life is giving us a sign here.

459
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,710
没错  我们得为此到处求人借款搞钱
Yes, we will have to beg, borrow, and steal the money for it,

460
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,910
但我...
but I--

461
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,600
那会是个崭新的开端
It would be a fresh start.

462
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,550
而我觉得这
And I think that that's something that

463
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,900
我们都需要
we could both use.

464
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,680
怎么了
What's up?

465
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,630
我能进来吗
Can I come in?

466
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,830
我喜欢你对这里做的改装
I love what you've done to the place.

467
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,870
听着  那个搞砸一切的代码
Listen, I was the one who wrote the code

468
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,440
是我写的
that took everything down.

469
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,800
是我...
Okay? It was me--

470
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,270
你没做什么错事
You didn't do anything wrong.

471
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,910
是啊  但你也是啊
Yeah, but neither did you.

472
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,660
谢谢你  但是...
I appreciate that, but...

473
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,610
这不重要了
It doesn't really matter.

474
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,880
那莎拉呢
What about Sara?

475
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,170
乔
Joe?

476
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,040
该死
Damn it.

477
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,790
你是个好人
You're a good man.

478
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,450
虽然你百般掩饰让人很难看出来
You make it really difficult for other people to see that,

479
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,720
但我看得出来
but I see it,

480
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,460
而且我觉得这跟她有一定关系
and I suspect she had something to do with that.

481
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,330
你这是安慰我吗
That supposed to make me feel better?

482
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,890
我只是来给你这个的
Look, I just came by to give you this.

483
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,890
{\pos(254.4,133.571)}白板

484
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,310
我修整了索纳里斯的代码
I went into the Sonaris code,

485
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,010
修复了未知输出结果错误
fixed the missing branch error.

486
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,580
不止如此
Not only that,

487
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,810
这一版能找到之前的版本
this version targets older copies.

488
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,170
将其完全消除
It eradicates them.

489
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,430
我还做了一些改进
I muscled it up some, too,

490
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,450
可以预防以后可能出现的病毒感染
so it'll inoculate machines from future infection.

491
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,450
这是很棒的解药
I mean, it's-- it's one hell of an antidote.

492
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,170
虽然不能修复已造成的伤害
I mean, it won't undo the damage done,

493
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:43,320
但也许你能利用这个平复一切
but maybe you can use it to make things right.

494
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,730
或者算向雅各布·维勒示好
Or a sign of good faith to Jacob Wheeler.

495
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,220
我不在乎雅各布·维勒
I don't care about Jacob Wheeler.

496
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,070
那就不管他  就当是为了莎拉
Then screw him. Do it for Sara.

497
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,210
那天晚上我们来这里吃饭时  你对我说
When we came to dinner here that night, you said to me,

498
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,180
"她让我们为事业承受的一切都变得有意义"
"She makes all the suffering of what we do worth it."

499
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,670
我告诉你
And I'm telling you,

500
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,790
这不是天天能遇到的
that is not an easy thing to come by.

501
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,790
你遇到后...
And when you do, it's--

502
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,630
想坚持下来甚至更难
it's even harder to make it last,

503
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,150
我也不知道
and, I don't know.

504
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,540
也许坚持不下来  但是...
Maybe it can't, but...

505
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,790
我知道如果你甚至都没有一试
I do know that you'll hate yourself

506
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,940
你每天都会恨自己
every day if you don't at least try.

507
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,830
好吧
Okay.

508
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,100
好吧
Yeah, okay.

509
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,860
伙计  过来
Hey, man, come here.

510
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,240
照顾好自己  乔
Take care of yourself, Joe.

511
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,750
我进去  告诉他
So I go in and I tell him, I said,

512
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,770
"看上去我们今年要完成110%的配额了"
"Now, it looks like we're gonna finish the year 110% of quota."

513
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,640
那个会计看着数据
My god, the accountant's looking at the numbers.

514
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,470
他说"这里写着83%  博斯沃思先生
He's going, "Well, it says here 83%, Mr. Bosworth.

515
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,620
这里写着是83%啊"
says here 83."

516
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,040
我说  "你算班尼斯特了吗
And I go, "Man, are you including Bannister?

517
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,980
那是两百万的交易啊"
That's a $2 million deal, man."

518
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,410
他说  "那不是第四季度完成的啊"
He goes, "Well... well, Bannister didn't close in Q4."

519
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,850
我说  "就是啊
And I said, "Sure, it did.

520
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:32,180
我12月35日亲自完成的交易"
I closed that son of a bitch on the 35th of december myself."

521
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,170
他这种笑话一大把呢
I tell ya, he's full of these.

522
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,870
不劝都停不住
Get him going, he won't stop.

523
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,380
詹姆斯  你真没说错你老爸
Well, James, you were right about your daddy.

524
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,060
不到一个月  他已经把这里打点利索了
A month in, he's already whipping this place into shape.

525
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,900
我从没怀疑过
I had no doubt.

526
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,640
在这里工作真是太棒了
Well, it's a damn fine place to work, I gotta say.

527
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,270
也谢谢你请我参加这种大人物的午宴
And thank you for inviting me to this big muckety-muck lunch here.

528
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,700
我知道你现在只是经理
Ah, I know you're only manager level now

529
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,930
我们也不是想破格升职你
and we're not fast-tracking anything here,

530
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,220
但我们觉得让你听听
but, well, we thought it'd be good for you to hear

531
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,150
上层的运作方式会比较好
how things are operating at the upper levels,

532
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,240
让你也谈谈看法
have your voice in the room.

533
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,970
斯特恩先生  不用说
And, Mr. Stern, it goes without saying

534
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,950
我很高兴今天能
that I sincerely appreciate the invite

535
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,860
受邀跟高级团队坐下谈谈
to sit down with the senior team today.

536
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,830
我这种后辈可不常出席这种场合
A junior boy like me is a guppy at this table.

537
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,420
要不是你  我们就请不来约翰
Well, without you, we wouldn't have John.

538
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,080
嗯
Well...

539
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,390
这个笑话我大概说过无数遍了
You know, I... I must've told this one about a million times,

540
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:24,820
但我记得我年轻点的时候  有个经理走进来
but I remember when I was a kid, a manager comes in and...

541
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,370
他说  "乔  你没达到配额
...He says, "Now, Joe, you're under quota.

542
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,010
我们得有盈余[黑]啊"
We need to be in the black."

543
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:32,440
我看着他  把咖啡倒在预估报告上
So I look at him, I toss my coffee cup up on the forecast,

544
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,830
我说  "这下够黑了吧"
and I say, "Now how's that for bein' in the black?"

545
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,360
唐娜
Donna?

546
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,030
唐娜
Donna?

547
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,280
戈登  你想干什么
Whoa, Gordon, what do you want?

548
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,560
-唐娜呢  -戈登
- Hey, where's Donna? - Okay, Gordon,

549
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,080
你还是先离她远点吧
I think you need to back off for a little bit.

550
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,950
该死  这跟你无关
Damn it, this has nothing to do with you.

551
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,880
戈登  我要你离开我家
Gordon, I want you out of my house.

552
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,990
她在这儿吗
Is she here?

553
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,500
-怎么回事啊  -她在这儿吗
- What the heck is going on? - Is she here?

554
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,840
-谁啊  -天呐  我以为她在你这儿
- Who? - Oh, christ, I thought she was with you.

555
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,800
戈登  你说什么呢
Gordon, what are you talking about?

556
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,520
我找不到琼妮了  她不在家
I can't find Joanie. She's not at the house.

557
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,050
也不在你爸妈家
She's not at your parents' house.

558
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,350
-海莉说她出走了  -好吧
- Haley said she ran away. - Okay...

559
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,600
你没见着她吗
You haven't seen her at all?

560
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,400
有时候她放学后跟海瑟一起骑自行车
Sometimes she rides bikes with Heather after school.

561
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,860
好吧  有消息告诉我  谢谢
Okay, well, just let me know. Thanks.

562
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,530
-你...  -玛莉安街上没有
- Did you... - I didn't see her on Marion

563
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,220
我一直开到了环形线那边
and I went all the way to belt line.

564
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,670
-那还有...  -她不在死巷里
- Oh, what about the, um... - She's not in the cul-de-sac

565
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,470
也不在小溪边
and she's not down by the creek either.

566
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,780
她的背包不见了
Okay, so, uh, her backpack is gone,

567
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,120
她的午餐盒也不见了  睡袋...
her lunch box is gone, her sleeping bag...

568
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,950
唐娜  我要你知道我没有...
Donna, I need you to know that I didn't...

569
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,530
这不怪我  我没有...
Look, this wasn't me. I didn't...

570
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,300
该死的  我没把她弄丢
God damn it, I didn't lose her.

571
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,970
海莉说她是自己出走了
Haley said that she ran away, okay?

572
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,960
唐娜  我需要你知道这不是我干的
Donna, I need you to know that this wasn't me.

573
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,420
妈妈  爸爸  看啊
Mommy, daddy, look.

574
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,570
-那是什么  -我们的宿营灯
- What is that? - It's our camping lantern.

575
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,980
我必须离开
I had to leave.

576
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,620
我说出了秘密
I told a secret.

577
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,880
结果导致你们不相爱了
And it made you not in love anymore.

578
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,480
听我说
Hey, hey, listen.

579
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:03,550
你妈妈和我有时候可能会吵架
Your mom and I may get into an argument sometimes, okay?

580
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:06,500
但那绝不会是因为你
But it's never because of you, okay?

581
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,940
你们会离婚吗
Are you gonna get divorced?

582
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,420
妈妈和爸爸很相爱
Mommy and daddy love each other very much.

583
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,940
但有些事我们需要谈谈
But there are some things that we need to talk about.

584
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,550
所以你回家里去吧
So why don't you go up to the house,

585
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,510
好好抱抱你妹妹
give your sister a big old hug,

586
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,510
然后一起选好
and you two can pick out

587
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:32,390
我们晚餐吃的披萨  好吗
what kind of pizza to get for dinner, okay?

588
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,070
乖
Good girl.

589
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,190
过来
Come here.

590
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,270
我不想做那种
I don't want to be the woman

591
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,240
抛弃患了病的丈夫的女人
that leaves her husband when he's sick,

592
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,180
但那不代表我就不会那么做
but that doesn't mean I won't.

593
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,210
我想了你说的话  我觉得你说得对
I thought a lot about what you said and I think you're right.

594
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,990
我们的婚姻有问题
This marriage isn't working,

595
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:10,880
所以我们得做对孩子  对我们自己最好的事
so we need to do what's best for the kids and what's best for us.

596
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,940
这是我的要求
So here are my terms.

597
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,950
你要写一张支票
You're gonna write a check.

598
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:25,860
金额几乎是我们所有的钱
It's gonna be for almost as much money as we have,

599
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,750
我们要用这张支票买一台3033主机
and we're gonna use it to buy a 3033 mainframe.

600
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,140
不仅如此  你还得帮我修好它
Not only that, you are gonna help me fix it up

601
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,600
让它再次运行起来
and get it running again.

602
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,450
主机在戴利城
The mainframe is in Daly City,

603
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,730
所以  没错  你要搬去加州
so, yes, you are going to move to California.

604
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:40,940
我们都要去
We all are.

605
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,880
这就是修复我们婚姻的代价
That is what it costs to fix our marriage.

606
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,090
这算什么  敲诈吗
So what is this, extortion?

607
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:53,310
不  这是投资
No, it's an investment.

608
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,480
不仅是投资主机  也是投资一件你相信
Not just in a mainframe, but in something that you believe in

609
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,450
或者说是我以为你相信的事
or something I thought you believed in

610
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,790
至少在你做出那种事之前
before you did what you did.

611
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,410
我知道我那样不对  我也很抱歉
Look, I know it was wrong and I'm sorry.

612
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,940
我说了  那是个错误
I told you it was a mistake.

613
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,180
不  我现在不想谈那个
No, I can't... I don't want to talk about that.

614
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,640
卡梅伦会在穆特尼给你份工作
Cameron is going to offer you a job at Mutiny

615
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,390
你要接受它
and you are gonna take it.

616
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,240
你要我去穆特尼工作
You want me to work at Mutiny?

617
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,900
不  我希望你配合我
No, I want you to work with me.

618
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,230
我们这样轮流
And this taking turns,

619
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:32,260
一个人拽着风筝线
this one person holding the kite strings

620
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,650
另一个去追逐梦想的方式
while the other person is off chasing something,

621
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,450
这是行不通的
that isn't working.

622
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,820
你真觉得
You really think that

623
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,210
搬去加州就能解决一切了吗
moving to California is gonna fix everything?

624
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:45,880
我不知道
I don't know.

625
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,560
但这是我能想到的最好的了
But it's the best thing I could come up with.

626
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:55,990
我只知道  如果我们留下
And I do know that if we stay here,

627
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,890
我们是撑不下去的
we are not gonna make it.

628
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:15,090
先生  已经三个小时了
Sir, it's already been three hours.

629
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,780
你还是预约一下
I suggest you make an appointment,

630
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,850
找个合适时机再来吧
come back at a more reasonable time.

631
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,700
我还想你会等多久呢
I was wondering how long you'd wait.

632
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,290
没想到啊  乔
I'm surprised, Joe.

633
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,910
你真有毅力  这我承认
You are persistent. I'll give you that much.

634
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:37,660
我想给你看样东西
I, uh... I wanted to show you something.

635
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,480
我离开卡迪夫后  去了别处
See, after my time at Cardiff, I went away.

636
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,680
我决定改变做事方式
I decided I should do things differently,

637
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,590
真实地做事
operate from a place of total authenticity.

638
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,740
开诚布公  有人情味  做正确的事
Be open, be human, do the right thing.

639
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:00,250
但事实就是
But the truth is,

640
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,260
再没有别人会下这种决心了
no one else made that pact with themselves.

641
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,930
所以我凭什么呢
So why should I?

642
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,800
这怎么回事
What is this?

643
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,290
该死
Damn it.

644
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,440
你的电脑现在中病毒了
Your computer's now infected with a virus,

645
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,590
就是毁掉了西方网络的那个
the same one that took down WestGroup.

646
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,470
是一个恶意下载程序
It's a malignant fetch program,

647
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,420
它会从这台电脑
and it will spread from this box

648
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,590
扩散到你们公司其他所有联网的电脑上
to every other networked computer in your organization.

649
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,180
天呐  我要叫保安了
Oh, my god. I'm calling security.

650
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,260
保安  你想要安全吗
Security? You want security?

651
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,980
为什么  因为你不信任我吗
Why, 'cause you don't trust me?

652
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,300
你不知道我会干出什么事来
You don't know what I'll do.

653
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,670
谁知道我能干出什么事呢
Who knows what I'll do?

654
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,350
没有信任  你就容易受到攻击
When there's no trust, you're vulnerable.

655
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:35,280
你虽然照规矩来  不代表别人也会
Just bause you play by the rules doesn't mean anyone else will.

656
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,390
你要怎么办呢
So what should you do?

657
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,080
你应该保护自己  建一堵墙
You should protect yourself, build a wall.

658
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,760
不是那样  这样
Not like that, like this.

659
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,850
你知道疫苗是什么吗
Do you know what a vaccine is?

660
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,660
不是药物  而是病毒的一部分
It's not medicine; it's a little bit of the virus.

661
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,190
你利用一点坏的东西
You take a little bit of something bad

662
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,280
来避免再受这样的伤害
So you can never be hurt like that again.

663
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,400
看看吧
Check it out.

664
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:24,730
你怎么做到的
It's... how'd you do that?

665
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,680
用解毒的解药
With an antidote to the poison.

666
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,260
没错  这个程序
Sure, this program only

667
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,440
只能防范这一种病毒
protects your machine from this specific virus,

668
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,590
但真正的产品  是安全
but the real product here is security,

669
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,900
一个抵御想伤害你的人的盾牌
a shield against those who would hurt you,

670
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,030
这些人或许是大意
perhaps because of their own carelessness

671
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,360
或许就是想摧毁你
or simply because they want to destroy you.

672
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,110
再加上西方网络的事引起了全国关注
And after the national exposure of what happened at WestGroup,

673
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:48,920
所有大企业都会想要这东西
entire organizations are going to be ravenous for this.

674
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,080
真正的安全  就是不信任任何人
The real security is trusting no one.

675
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,030
这是你自己的主意吗
And you came up with this all on your own?

676
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,130
披萨来了
Pizza's here!

677
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,980
好了  你们小心点
All right, guys, be careful.

678
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,510
别烫着了
Don't burn yourselves, okay?

679
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,410
-喂  -戈登  是我
- Hello? - Gordon, it's me.

680
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,690
"制造疾病  售卖解药"
"Create the sickness, sell the cure."

681
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,250
-什么  -"制造疾病  售卖解药"
- What? - "Create the sickness, sell the cure."

682
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,200
记得你之前来我家时吗
You remember when you came over to my place?

683
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,600
我现在没法说话  乔
I can't talk right now, Joe.

684
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,440
不不  我听取了你的建议  戈登
No, no, no, I took your advice, Gordon,

685
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,250
我把坏事变成好事了  大好事
and I turned this into something good, really good.

686
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,120
好啊  我很高兴  但我得挂了
That's great. I'm glad, but, look, I gotta go.

不不  你得听我说
No, no, you gotta hear me out.

688

你日后会庆幸的  我们该庆祝一下  戈登
You'll be glad you did. We should celebrate, Gordon.

我们有个天大的好机会
We've got an incredible opportunity.

690
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,400
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

691
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,510
我是说  你和我  我们一起
I'm talking about you and me together,

692

再次做搭档

693
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,910
你在干什么呢
What... what are you doing right now?

694
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,580
我们得好好谈谈  我去你家
We gotta talk this through. I'll come over.

695
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,560
我不能再跟你合伙了
Look, I can't do this anymore.

696
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,550
唐娜和我要搬去加州了
Donna and I are moving to California.

697
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,880
好啊  那我们去加州做  就该这么做
Great, we can do this in California. In fact, we should.

698
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,610
我要去穆特尼工作
I'm going to work for Mutiny.

699
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,770
我现在得把心放在家里
I need to focus on my family right now.

700
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,590
你要去穆特尼工作
You're going to work for Mutiny?

701
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:18,260
乔  听我说  我不...
Listen, Joe, I... I didn't...

702
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:28,430
{\pos(194.1,212.189)}一个月后

703
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,390
早上好啊
Good morning.

704
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,070
这是我的提议
So, here's my offer.

705
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,720
穆特尼已经不再做游戏了
While Mutiny is no longer a games company,

706
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,510
我们要迁往加州
we are relocating to California

707
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,680
我们需要你这样有才华的人
and could use a talented hand like yours

708
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,880
帮助我们把业务扩展到全国范围内
as we attempt to take our service national.

709
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,700
你不需要马上答复我
I don't need an answer right away.

710
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,370
我...你可以自己决定
I just... you can decide

711
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,570
今晚8:45是不是想搭上离开达拉斯机场的班机
if you want to be on the 8:45 out of DFW tonight.

712
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:05,270
即使你不想要这份工作  也来吧
And even if you don't want the job, just come anyways.

713
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,100
机票是免费的
It's a free plane ticket.

714
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:12,530
这可没给我多少时间做决定啊
That's not a lot of time to decide.

715
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:16,900
或许是没多少时间让你想太多
Or maybe it's just enough time not to overthink it.

716
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:49,960
如果她1955年爱上一个叫马蒂的人
Look, if she's in love with a guy named Marty in 1955,

717
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,730
然后她生了个孩子  给他起名叫马蒂
then she has a kid, she names him Marty

718
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:52,780
那孩子长大后跟她当初
and that kid grows up to look exactly like

719
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,160
爱上的马蒂一模一样
the Marty that she fell in love with,

720
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,910
他们要么会上床
they're either gonna bone

721
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,520
要么她会精神崩溃  要么两者都是
or she's gonna have a nervous breakdown or both.

722
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:00,650
要么我不在乎  你就把嘴闭上吧
Or I don't care. Just shut up and stop talking about it.

723
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,700
莱夫
Hey, Lev.

724
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,780
我还担心她们
You know, I was worried about them,

725
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,240
离开学校
pulling them out of school

726
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:16,190
离开朋友和我爸妈会不适应
and away from their friends and my folks,

727
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:20,050
但她们是机上最开心的人了
but they are the happiest people on this plane.

728
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,450
知道吗
You know...

729
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,530
我们可以再次幸福起来
We could be happy again.

730
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,900
我真心相信
I really believe that.

731
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,610
谁知道呢
And who knows?

732
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,570
或许等我们到了加州
Maybe when we get to California...

733
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,450
说不定
I don't know,

734
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,750
我们可以再要一个
maybe we'll have another.

735
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:58,060
我要趁起飞前用下洗手间
I'm gonna go use the bathroom before we take off.

736
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,760
女士们先生们  欢迎登上

请大家坐好
If everyone could please take your seats,

739
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,710
我们马上就将起飞

740
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,960
行了  女士们
All right, ladies.

741
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,190
我从没想到我会说这话
You know, I never thought I'd say this, but

742
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:10,600
看来我们该搬去东海岸了
I guess it's time to move out to the Left Coast.

743
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,370
准备好了吗
Are you ready for this?

744
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,090
好
Okay.

745
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:50,300
麦克米伦实用网络获得一千万风投开发新"病毒防护"软件

746
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,050

整个一层楼都归你们
You'll have the entire floor.

748
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,080
足够放下一百多张办公桌
Enough space for a 100-plus desks.

749
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:14,570
但由于地处旧金山湾黄金地段  我...
But because of the prime Bay Area location I'll just...

750
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,400
得告诉你  还有别人对这里感兴趣呢
let you know I have several other interested parties.

751
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,530
我要了
I'll take it.

752
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,920
要谈谈价钱吗
We'll need to discuss price?

753
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:28,780
那我去办手续了
Then I'll go get the paper work.

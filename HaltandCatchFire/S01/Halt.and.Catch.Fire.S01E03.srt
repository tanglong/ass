- Is it alive? - Mommy, is it okay?

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,610
妈妈  救救它
Mommy, fix it. Make it better.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,020
姑娘们  妈妈马上就回来  好吗
Girls, girls, Mommy's gonna be right back, okay?

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,500
它的翅膀怎么了
Why don't its wings work?

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,040
戈登  它还有气吗
Gordon, is it breathing?

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,370
快没了
Barely.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,270
小心沾上螨虫
Yeah, watch out for mites.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,530
我们能做点什么吗
Well, is there something we can do?

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,180
-喂点水  或者...  -那都无济于事了
- Give it some water, or... - I think we're beyond that.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,080
我该带它去看兽医
I should take it to the vet.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,250
亲爱的  孩子们要去上学
Honey, the girls have to get to school.

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,790
你的车还在修理店
And with your car in the shop...

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,250
是  你说得对
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,970
要搭车吗  邻居
Hey, you need a ride, neighbor?

15
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,880
那真是太好了
Oh, that would be so great.

16
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,400
-多谢了  布莱恩  -没关系
- Yeah, thanks, Brian. - Hey, no problemo.

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,410
可怜的小东西
Poor little sucker.

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,240
放手听凭天意  对吧
Let go, let God, right?

19
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,580
伙计
Hey, man.

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,400
今天别紧张
Don't sweat today.

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,480
你能行的
You can do this.

{\pos(193,250)}声级表

23
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,750
不是你的错
Look, it's not your fault.

24
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,310
不是任何人的错
It's no one's fault.

25
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,880
这就像冬天下了场早雪
It's like when you get an early snow

26
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,920
把柑橘林冻坏了
and it freezes your orange grove.

27
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,020
果农不得已只能另寻办法供应果汁了
And then the farmer has to find another way to deliver the juice.

28
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,650
哪怕每片雪花都和你一样
Even if every snowflake is totally unique 

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,370
独特
like you.

-戈登  你搞什么  -你安排在11点45
- Gordon, what the hell? - You're my 11:45.

31
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,150
你让我们像一群白痴似的在外面乱转
You got us milling around out there like a bunch of Frenchmen.

32
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,080
兰迪  我正和人谈事呢
Randy, I'm with someone.

33
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,570
我可以排队等着坐摩天轮
I'll wait in line for a Ferris wheel.

34
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,010
排队等着买啤酒
I'll wait in line for a beer.

35
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,020
但绝不会坐等到11点45
But damned if I'll wait around till 11:45 

36
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,220
让你和乔·麦克米伦开除我
to get fired by flipping you or flipping Joe MacMillan.

37
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,630
你要开除我吗
Wait, you're firing me? 

38
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,350
-我这是要被开除了吗  -冷静点
- I'm being fired? - Just calm down.

39
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,040
我的推荐信
My reference letter.

40
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,970
别担心  我都写好了
And don't worry, I wrote it myself.

代表这个曾经辉煌的公司

我很期待有天开车经过这里
I look forward to driving past here

看到草坪上钉着"出租"的牌子
when the "For Lease" signs get nailed to the lawn

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,140
而你的个人电脑幻想则土崩瓦解
and your little PC vision quest crashes and burns.

00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,380
28磅
28 pounds.

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,290
这不是便携  顶多是可携
That's not portable, that's luggable.

50
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,050
分发的资料上的销售额
And those are the combined sales figures

51
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,420
是科乐  微泰和雅达利三家的总和

52
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,150
-那是电子游戏  -是微机

这证明美国人渴望拥有这些电器
Proof that America wants these machines in their homes.

54
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,950
而个人电脑行业作何回应呢
And how did the PC business respond?

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,360
他们塞给消费者的是录音机  缝纫机和化油器
With a cassette deck, a sewing machine, and a carburetor.

56
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,850
我们才不要造这些大块头
We're not making a carburetor.

00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,170
我们要造的  是这个
We're making this.

你是不是算错数了  戈登
You've got that number wrong, right, Gordon?

65
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,390
这配置至少得花个一百万
It's gonna take a million dollars

这的确很有野心
It's ambitious.

You know who was good with screens?

-兰迪  -没错
- Randy. - Sure was.

71
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,650

Say, where is Randy? Oh, that's right, you fired him.

Run out to the parking lot. Maybe you can flag him down.

-戈登  出来一下  -几位  冷静一下
- Gordon, outside. - Guys, relax.

- No, I'm not relaxing. - Wake up, Brian.

75
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,100
过去好歹我们造的东西还卖得出去
We used to build products that people would buy.

76
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,370
现在净说疯话了
We're not even in reality anymore.

After I let go of 46 people this morning,

00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,660
我本来就不该负责开人
something I'm in no way qualified to do.

81
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,650
我更担心他们的态度
I'm worried about their attitude.

82
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,950
他们的态度基于物理定律
Their attitude is based on the laws of physics,

83
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,950
换做我是你  就认真学学物理
which, if I were you, I'd bone up on.

84
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,170
这些工程师是我们仅剩的
You're looking at our only engineers

有微处理器相关经验的人了
with any microprocessor experience at all.

86
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,140
就剩他们了  所以没错  就这几块料
They're what's left, so, yeah, these are my guys.

00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,510
你最起码等我们走了再来扫荡吧
You could at least wait until we've left the building.

如果限频是4兆赫的话  也许用不着散热器
Well, we run it at four megahertz, maybe we don't need one.

There's gotta be a way to add speed without adding heat.

Or you can build in a griddle and fry steaks on it.

你打算给这房间起个什么名字
What do you want to call this place?

They have cash to spend and they want exposure to this market.

我们的个人电脑是个不错的切入点
Our PC could be a nice entry point.

但更重要的是键盘回弹问题
But the bigger problem is with the keyboard bouncing.

我们最好能重新设计这个...
If we could just redesign the trim, then--

但那不属于我们的责任  对吧
But that's not our purview, right?

她以为在德州仪器干就不用离开德州呢
Well, she thought that Texas Instruments meant staying in Texas.

136
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,570
这是我们5年来的第三站了
This is our third stop in five years, so...

137
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,410
我觉得她想要安定下来  但...
I think she wants to settle down, but--

138
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,700
但往上爬可不能停下
But that's not the way you climb the ladder.

139
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,540
真不敢相信我们的谈话
I can't believe we're talking like this--

140
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,250
往上爬  季度目标什么的
climbing ladders, quarterly targets.

141
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,820
我们离开高中真是好久了
We are a long way from high school.

142
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,350
感谢上帝  我那时的发型和乐队队服
Oh, well, thank God. My hair and that band uniform.

143
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,580
我们都知道你不合适做乐队
Hey, we all knew that you weren't cut out for band.

144
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,710
你只是想打发时间
You were just marking time,

145
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,730
等待更好的未来
waiting for something better to come along.

146
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,190
唐娜
Donna...

147
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,110
不是想为难你
not to be a pain,

148
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,560
但是我明天要和马克见面
but I'm meeting with Mark tomorrow

149
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,330
你的报告会很有用
and that report would be helpful.

150
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,910
好的
Oh, okay.

151
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,640
我会交给你的
You'll have it.

152
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,000
麦克米伦先生办公室
Mr. MacMillan's office.

153
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,500
卡梅伦吗
Cameron?

154
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,970
我们有理想的商业环境  无可限量的发展前景
We have got an ideal business climate. Unlimited growth curve.

155
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,440
而且刚被IBM打得屁滚尿流
And you just got your ass handed to you by IBM.

156
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,080
他们试过了  但没成功
They took their shot. They missed.

157
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,970
但系统程序包挣的钱快花光了  对吧
But the cash from your system packages is running out, correct?

158
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,820
伙计们  我迟早也会知道
Guys, I'm gonna find out anyway.

159
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,200
-怎么说  -我们跟你们合伙
- How's that? - Well, we partner with you,

160
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,270
就得详细审查你们的账面
we audit your books top to bottom,

161
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,530
任命高管到你们公司
install upper management on-site,

162
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,910
应该是罗杰
probably Roger.

163
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,960
-你向他报告  -罗杰
- You'd report to him. - Roger?

164
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,810
这个想法还在讨论中
It's just an option we're discussing.

165
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,080
-午饭时谈的吗  -没错
- At lunch? - That's right.

166
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,860
或许与其派一个人来
You know, maybe instead of sending someone out, 

167
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,560
不如你每周打个电话
you do a weekly call.

168
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,600
伙计们  展示日期都还没谈呢
Guys, I haven't even heard a rollout date yet, okay?

169
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,000
你们的营销策略是什么
What's your marketing strategy?

170
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,280
打算怎么重新建立客户群体
How do you plan on rebuilding your client base here?

171
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,430
我们有全新的客户群了
We got a whole new client base.

172
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,950
是的  乔打算让这款机器面向大众
Yeah, Joe here wants to take this machine to the people.

173
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,120
不再只卖给企业
Yeah, no more biz-to-biz.

174
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,300
我们要挨家挨户  走街串巷
We're pushing doorbells and pounding pavement.

175
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,290
还会有高端的媒体宣传
Along with a sophisticated media campaign.

176
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,200
高端什么啊  得了吧  乔
Oh, sophisticated, my ass. Come on, Joe.

177
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,610
我们受够了这些华而不实的发布和公司策略
We're tired of these doodad launches and corporate suites.

178
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,850
我想接地气
No, I wanna breathe me some air.

179
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,670
小店啦  乡村集市啦
You know, mom-and-pop stores, county fairs.

180
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,190
我们目前是没有业绩也没有资产负债表
Now, we may not have the track record or the balance sheet,

181
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,240
但我发誓  我们有决心
but, by God, we got heart.

182
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,010
有诚挚的德州精神
The can-do Texas spirit, y'all.

183
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,960
我家电话在背面
My home number's on the back.

184
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,750
随时欢迎致电
I want you to call the ranch anytime.

185
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,690
我会的
Sure will.

186
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,670
我给你看些策划吧
Let me show you some sketches.

187
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,960
很高兴再次见到你  乔
It's so good seeing you again, Joe.

188
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,080
我们再联系
I'll be in touch.

189
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,710
让他们走吧  好吗
What do you think? Let 'em go?

190
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,920
午夜之前就走吗
What, before midnight?

191
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,230
靠最后冲刺是赢不了的
You can't win a race at the quarter pole.

192
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,730
真的  对他们好一点
Seriously, buy yourself some goodwill with these guys.

193
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,950
好吧  谢谢大家
All right, thanks, everyone.

194
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,150
回家吧
Have a good night.

195
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,620
尤其我们还想
Especially if we try 

196
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,950
把一块更大的主板塞进一个更小的箱子里
and cram a bigger motherboard into a smaller case.

197
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,540
不管怎样  换晶振  超频CPU
Either way, we swap out the crystal and we overclock the CPU.

198
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,560
那样内部温度会升高  就需要更大的散热器
Which heats up the innards, which means a bigger heat sink.

199
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,900
别忘了  我们才抛弃了散热器
And may I remind you, we just ditched the heat sink.

200
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,300
怎么样了
Hey, how's it going?

201
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,960
-不准接触  忘了吗  -我知道
- No contact, remember? - I know, I know.

202
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,730
我不是想打听什么
Look, I don't mean to pry.

203
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,000
我知道才过了一周  你压力也很大
I know it's only been a week and you're under a lot of pressure,

204
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,520
但要是你能给我们透露点大致...
but if you could just give us some sort of idea as to--

205
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,760
我去订披萨
I'll order a pizza.

206
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,880
她拿走了我的苏打水
She took my soda.

207
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,510
要想忘了生活多不顺心  泡泡浴是最佳办法
Nothing like a bubble bath to make you forget life's little traumas.

208
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,080
-我觉得管用  -我们还给他们买了点东西
- Works for me. - Oh, we also got them a little something.

209
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,430
不用这么客气的
Oh, you shouldn't have.

210
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,410
{\an8}安息吧  鲍瑟

211
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,730
"鲍瑟"吗
"Bowser"?

212
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,680
可不像鸟的名字
It's not exactly a bird's name.

213
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,320
可怜的小家伙现在应该已经死了
Poor thing's dead by now.

214
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,220
随便怎么叫他都行了
I expect you can call it whatever you like.

215
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,940
那是肖邦的《葬礼进行曲》吗
Is that Chopin's "Funeral March"?

216
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,190
日本人勤奋得过头  看这个
The Japanese never sleep. Look here.

217
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,550
这是我们杂志这个月的封底
It's our back pager this month.

218
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,160
你父亲觉得我们能卖个五十万
Your father thinks we'll move half a million.

219
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,740
真像他  我"毫不怀疑"
"No-doubt" dad.

220
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,360
这可是做分类广告  亲爱的
It's a catalogue business, darling.

221
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,870
"怀疑总是存在"
"There's always doubt."

222
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,810
别告诉戈登是我们送的
Now, don't go telling Gordon it's from us.

223
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,880
我知道他不喜欢这样
I know he doesn't approve.

224
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,810
他加班吗
He working late?

225
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,430
他有个新项目
He's got a new project.

226
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,330
一定让他时不时洗洗盘子啊
Well, make sure he does the dishes sometime.

227
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,110
我爱我女婿
I love my son-in-law,

228
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,990
但我不希望你忙活到人老珠黄
but I don't wanna see you worn down to a nub.

229
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,860
怎么  你觉得我人老珠黄吗
Why, do I seem nubbish to you?

230
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,630
你还是那么容光焕发
You are radiant, as always.

231
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,260
在德州仪器干得怎么样
How's life at TI?

232
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,390
亨特搬回来后  我们还没在俱乐部里见过他
You know, we haven't even seen Hunt at the club since he moved back.

233
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,730
埋头苦干着呢
Well, nose to the grindstone.

234
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,250
可能独立日那天
Well, maybe Fourth of July,

235
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,660
他会来炫耀下他的外国老婆
he'll show off that foreign wife of his.

236
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,100
-妈  她是加拿大人  -她现在客居我们国家
- Mom, she's Canadian. - She is a guest of this country.

237
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:45,320
完全可以像我们一样挥挥旗子  点点火
She can wave a flag and light something on fire like the rest of us.

238
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,110
我觉得他们不会在达拉斯久留
Well, I don't think they'll be in Dallas long.

239
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,090
如果高层喜欢他  可能会外派
If management likes him, they'll probably ship him overseas.

240
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,990
老亨特在维也纳  或是意大利罗马
Old Hunt in Vienna or Rome, Italy.

241
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,850
想象得到吗
Can you imagine?

242
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,180
-这里不错啊  -人得有个逃避的地方
- This is very nice. - A man needs to seek shelter.

243
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,760
相信在这点上我们是一样的
I believe we have that in common.

244
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,780
我们不只需要投资  还得找明白人投资
We don't just need money. We need smart money.

245
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,470
需要名声  需要人帮我们出名
A name. Someone who puts us on the map.

246
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,570
是的  我知道
Yeah, I know.

247
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,120
你没有做错
You weren't wrong to do what you did,

248
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,750
但约翰也没做错
but then, neither was John.

249
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,370
点了两杯威士忌  我替你挑了个
A little scotch here, and... I guessed.

250
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,840
我们放你进来  乔  也给了你机会
We let you in the door, Joe, we gave you the rope.

251
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,180
但只有一个人能做主
But only one boss-dick can swing it.

252
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,090
你是目标远大的那个
Now, you're the vision guy

253
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,610
我已经退休了  不想重出江湖
and I'm retired and I want to stay retired.

254
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,160
所以约翰得给我寄支票
The way that works is that John here sends me my checks,

255
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,180
让我锦衣玉食  开开心心
keeps me fat and happy.

256
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,570
所以由约翰来做这个项目的财政决策
So John makes the financial decisions on this project, 

257
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,760
所有财政决策
all of them.

258
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,370
同意
Agreed.

259
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,010
很好
Good.

260
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,590
别再在背后搞什么鬼了
No more backstage bullshit.

261
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,500
我会安排你跟露易丝·卢瑟福会面
I'm gonna set you up with Louise Lutherford.

262
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,860
-她是我们的老朋友  -挺不好对付的
- An old friend of ours. - Mm-hmm, she is a handful...

263
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,060
但她有足够的资金帮我们度过这关
but she's got more than enough capital to see us through.

264
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,980
而且她是当地人  不是外来的
And she's local, so no "Rogers."

265
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,620
这是挺好
Yeah, that's all well and good,

266
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,730
但她是否了解...
but does she have a background in--

267
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,970
晚上好  赛斯
Good evening, Seth.

268
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,010
卡迪夫先生  还要点餐吗
Mr. Cardiff. Are we dining tonight?

269
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,460
你知道的  我要小份菲力牛排
Oh, you know it. I'll have the petit fillet.

270
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,320
全熟  配豌豆和土豆泥
Burn it, and peas and mash.

271
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,570
牛腰肉  一分熟
Porterhouse, rare. Rare.

272
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,870
我要和他一样的
I'll have the same.

273
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,220
我们可以把键盘嵌在底盖上
I mean, we could recess the keyboard in the bottom cover

274
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,080
然后让线缆穿过铰链
and run the connector cable through the hinges.

275
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,730
好啊  从来没人这么做过
Okay. No one's ever done that before.

276
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,690
那就不能这么做了吗
Well, does that mean it can't be done?

277
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,830
不是  只是成本太高
No, just expensive.

278
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,780
不然要怎么留出安装屏幕的地方啊
Well, how else are we gonna make room for the screen?

279
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,030
戈登  不是我要扫你的兴
Gordon, I'm not trying to yuck your yum here.

280
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,460
没人比我更希望这能成功了
No one wants this to work more than me.

281
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,120
这个概念惊为天人  但要执行起来
It's a hell of a concept, but to execute it...

282
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,800
-很不容易  -我知道  我知道
- ...that's tough sleddin'. - I know, I know.

283
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,430
明天一大早  坐下来跟乔好好谈谈
First thing tomorrow, we sit down with Joe,

284
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,490
让他认清现实  告诉他这是不可能的
bring him back to Earth, tell him it can't be done.

285
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,730
如果需要  我可以陪着你
I'll fly wingman if you want.

286
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,670
不不  我来告诉他
No, no, I'll tell him.

287

怎么了
What?

288
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,550
你之前来过电话
You called earlier.

289
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,600
不  我没有
No, I don't--

290
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,070
好吧  好吧  我打错了
yes, fine, yes, I did by mistake.

291
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:09,960
你想怎么样
What? What do you want?

292
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,670
我就是问问情况
Just checking in.

293
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,670
我这儿一切正常
Okay, I'm all checked.

294
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,430
-我就是想知道  -怎么花这么久
- I just wanted to know... - What's taking so long?

295
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,510
你是个很有天赋的程序员
You're a talented coder,

296
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,070
可现在你是我们的瓶颈
but right now you're a bottleneck.

297
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,650
你考虑过去做励志演讲吗
Have you considered motivational speaking?

298
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,480
你蛮有天赋的  伙计
'Cause you've got a gift, man.

299
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,730
说真的  我报名参加  把磁带寄给我吧
Seriously, sign me up. Send me the tapes.

300
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,810
需要我下去找你吗
Do I need to come down there?

301
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,420
不
No.

302
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,200
-那我就...  -再见
- Then I guess I'll-- - See ya.

303
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,340
抱歉我没见着你妈
Sorry I missed your mother.

304
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,250
你偷着乐呢吧
No, you're not.

305
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,640
至少鸟已经死了
At least the bird's gone.

306
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,350
孩子们都很不开心  几乎没吃东西
The girls were so upset, they barely ate.

307
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,860
是吗
Yeah?

308
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,580
也许不是吃鸡肉的最佳时机
Maybe not the best night for chicken.

309
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,440
你觉得还要花多久
So, how much longer, do you think?

310
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,970
几个小时吧
Couple hours.

311
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,340
你这设计挺有意思的
That's an interesting layout.

312
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,480
如果都能放下的话
If I can make it all fit.

313
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,260
你能帮我...
Can you take a--

314
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,620
不行  戈登  我得先做完这个
No, Gordon, I have to finish this.

315
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,570
你说得对  我很抱歉
You're right, you're right. I'm sorry.

316
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,570
-其实有个地方可以改一下  -哪里
- Well, you know what you could do? - What?

317
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,000
你可以改变中断控制器的位置
You could move the interrupt controller

318
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,610
然后可以把奇偶校验内存芯片挪到下面
and then maybe scootch those parity RAM chips down.

319
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,260
-你介不介意我...  -不不  你来
- Do you mind if I-- - No, no, no.

320
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,720
-归你了  -这里  还有这里
- All yours. - Here and here.

321
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,450
如果你旋转这些DMA控制器  腾出空间
Then if you rotate these DMA controllers to make room,

{\pos(208,252)}直接内存访问控制器  用于提升外设通讯效率

you can...

324
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,500
等等  等等  什么
Wait, wait, wait, what?

做成复式的
Piggyback it.

- Software comes and goes... - Hardware is forever.

327
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,500
好吧
Okay.

328
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,490
好吧  这有点意思
Okay, okay, that's interesting.

329
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,120
那是劳埃德的鞋子吗
Those Lloyd's shoes?

330
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,830
劳埃德是什么人
Who the hell's Lloyd?

331
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,040
拜托
Come on.

332
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,040
劳埃德是个很厉害的保龄球手
Lloyd... one hell of a bowler.

Good Lutheran, three kids.

334

今早我不得不把他开除了
I had to fire him this morning.

335
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,230
你觉得这样好吗
You think it's a good idea

336
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,540
穿着被开除的人的鞋子走来走去
walking around in a dead man's shoes?

337
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,260
你要去哪  小丫头
Where are you headed, young lady?

338
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,410
这是你第一份工作吧  我没猜错吧
This is your first job, huh? Am I right?

339
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,940
这就下班之后在办公室里到处乱翻了
You're already rooting around the offices after hours?

340
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,100
我听说公司最近资金紧张
I heard money's tight around here.

341
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,120
所以想关灯省点电
I thought I'd switch off your light.

"Go To"和"Go Sub"有什么区别

"Go To" executes the next line.

345
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,870
而"Go Sub"需要在结尾加上返回命令
"Go Sub," You need, like, a return command at the end.

346
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,430
我完全看不懂
That makes no sense to me.

347
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,360
一开始是有点难
Yeah, it's hard at the beginning.

348
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,510
如果不是因为你朋友乔
If it weren't for your friend Joe...

349
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,190
我现在已经回家了
I'd be home right now.

但不能住在这里
You cannot live here.

356
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,340
我们有办法了
I think we can make this work.

357
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,600
如果我们将主板分成两部分
If we actually split the motherboard

358
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,040
然后叠在一起
and then layer

one half on top of the other,

00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,830
将跳线垂直放置
run the jumpers vertically.

361
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,220
这样每一部分上面的芯片数可以翻倍
So you're doubling the amount of chips on each half.

362
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,900
-没错  -有意思
- Yeah. - Interesting.

363
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,220
你怎么想到的
Where'd you get that idea?

364

In my kitchen.

365
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,280
这是能给我们省下几厘米的空间
It'd buy us a couple centimeters, for sure.

366
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,940
-干得好  -如果我们能固定住支持点的话
- Nice work. - If we can stabilize the vertices.

367
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,530
就不能让我们乐呵会儿吗  斯坦
Hey, why don't you let it ride for a cycle, Stan?

372

Not like this. I call it a layered array.

00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,860

For Cardiff Electric? Is that reasonable?

I mean, what are we doing here?

那都是贪婪物欲的小仓鼠在转轮子
Materialistic greed hamsters spinning their wheels.

404
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,960
你不还想要汽车吗
Oh, says the guy who wants a car.

405
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,570
等天黑我们要去雅皮士街
Come nightfall we're gonna head up to Yuppie Row

406
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,640
在那儿到处留名
and tag the living crap out of it.

407
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,780
在那之前  我们就在这儿待着
Until then we're just gonna hole up here, you know,

408
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,090
随便玩玩  喝点伏特加
thrash a bit, pound some vodka.

409
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,540
但我们没有伏特加了
Thing is, we're short on vodka.

410
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,410
那么就只剩下闲待着了呗
So, you're just gonna hang out here till then?

411
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,910
你有更好的主意吗
Yeah, you got a better idea?

412
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,700

钱就是钱  对吧
Well, money's money, right?

416
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,530
没事  进去吧

乔瑟夫  你是哪人啊
So, Joseph, where do you hail from?

425
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,230
崔维斯和我每年都去  他...
Travis and I go annually. He 

426
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,110
不愿去看我资助的歌剧
ignores the opera, I sponsor it.

427
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,680
上一季我们去看了《费加罗的婚礼》
Last season, we saw "Figaro."

428
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,370
结果怎么样
How'd that turn out?

429
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,140
一如既往  约翰
Same way it always does, John.

430
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,510
那是有两百年历史的剧了
It's 200 years old.

431
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,510
但我真不忍看着他们
But I do hate when they try to force 

432
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,230
强迫那可怜的孩子娶他母亲
that poor boy to marry his own mother.

433
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,540
没办法  他欠她钱嘛
Of course. He owes her money.

434
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,840
约翰  我看你是带了只鲨鱼来
John, I believe you brought a shark to my table.

435
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,610
没有  就是做生意而已
No, dear. Just a deal.

436
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,860
是啊  内森跟我说了
Yes, yes. Nathan mentioned it.

437
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,480
我自己也去查了一下
I did a little research of my own.

438
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,670
你们的个人电脑项目  我出一千万
I will take 80% of your PC project 

439
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,990
占80%的股份
for $10 million.

440
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,890
这有点过分了吧
That's a little aggressive.

441
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,790
约翰  IBM要把你们搅黄了
John, IBM has poisoned your well.

442
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,190
我知道我不是内森·卡迪夫最先想到的人
I know I'm not the first name on Nathan Cardiff's Rolodex,

443
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,960
所以你们现在肯定资金不畅
which means your cash flow is a little stopped up,

444
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,750
就像我第二任丈夫的主动脉
kind of like my second husband's aorta.

445
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,660
我们的预计收入比那要多好几番
Our projected earnings are many multiples of that.

446
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,300
如果你能搞到更好的合同
If there's a better deal for you elsewhere,

447
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,650
你就去吧
you are welcome to take it.

448
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,710
失陪了
Y'all excuse us?

449
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,320
-这简直是疯了  -你小声点
- This is insane. - Keep your voice down.

450
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,250
就这价格  我们不如去银行
At that price, we're better off going to the banks

451
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,610
或是卖给坦迪公司
or selling to Tandy.

452
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,170
好吧  让我跟她谈谈
All right, let me talk her off the ledge.

453
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,690
她对我们的电脑一无所知
This person knows nothing about our machine.

454
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,690
她会给它改头换面然后推出去
She'll wrap it in velvet, call it "Bonnie Blue,"

455
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,040
我们到时根本无力阻止
and we won't be able to stop her.

456
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,620
伙计  我们已经没辙了
Hey, partner, we're already there.

457
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,450
乔瑟夫  一切还好吧
Joseph, is everything all right?

458
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,660
太好了  晚餐上好了
Oh, glorious. Dinner's served.

459
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,410
-他在打电话  -跟马克吗
- He's on the call. - With Mark?

460
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,240
天呐  那我偷偷溜进去递给他吧
Oh, God. Maybe I could just sneak in and hand it to him.

461
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,840
-还是别了  -我可以...
- I wouldn't. - I could just--

462
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,660
马克  这你清楚  我也清楚
Mark, you know that and I know that,

463
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,640
但我们要怎么说服萨默维尔那边
but how can we get Somerville on board?

464
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,590
我已经竭尽全力了
Well, I'm doing everything I can.

465
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,170
你的工作是做什么的

Oh, yeah.

468
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,600
我爸爸好像也是做那个的
I think my dad does something like that.

469
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,870
好像吧
I think.

484
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,420
别闹了  你可真坏
Stop, you're so bad.

485
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,990
乔瑟夫  你怎么看
So, Joseph, what do we think?

486
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,910
奥马哈市吗
About Omaha?

太空计划  萨莉·莱德小姐

就是骗人的把戏
It's a gimmick.

489
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,380
你不为宇航局打破性别界限感到骄傲吗
You're not proud of NASA for breaking the gender barrier?

490
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,990
苏联人早就做到了  两次
The Soviets did it-- twice.

491

Now, now, go easy on him, Loulu. He's a Yankee.

494
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,940
抱歉
Sorry.

495
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,700
我要跟你们合作
Getting into bed with you boys.

496
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,640
至少得搞清楚你们是什么样的人啊
Least I can do is check the sheets and fluff the pillows.

497
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,670
是不是  崔维斯
Isn't that right, Travis?

498
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,290
我们不会合作的
We're not gonna be partners.

499
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,670
为什么
Why's that?

500
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,690
因为你就是个无聊  恶毒的外行
Because you're a bored, poisonous dilettante

501
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,910
有大把的闲暇时间  却毫无品味
with time on her hands and no taste.

平庸  和以自我为中心
mediocrity and making it about yourself.

504
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,900
而你这人就是事事以自我为中心
I think you make everything about yourself.

505
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,850
所以你的朋友都是租来的  其他人都讨厌你
That's why you rent your friends and repel everyone else.

506
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,630
博斯  我们还做不做生意了

我会让巴瑞起草文件
I'll have Barry draw up the papers.

508

这就对了  乔瑟夫  你看  这并不难
There, you see? Joseph, it's not hard.

509
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,350
要知道自己的地位
It's just knowing your side of the saddle.

510
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,870
还要酒吗
More wine?

511
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,190
崔维斯  给我们拿些白兰地来  我们要庆祝

- Yo, Cam, let me finish. - No.

513
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,390
我其实
I don't know 

514
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,130
对白兰地毫不了解
jack squat about brandy.

515
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,860
这糖霜太好吃了
Fantastic meringue.

516
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,020
怎么去了这么久
What took you so long?

517
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,670
现在喝白兰地太晚了
It's too late for brandy.

518
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,750
不是白兰地
It's not brandy.

给我来一杯吧
I'll take a snort.

523

给她倒一杯  崔维斯

把我们都握在手腕里了
had us right where she wanted us and 

526
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,420
然后又把我们踢走
she kicked us to the curb.

527
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,650
我们都说好了的
Hell, we had a deal. 

528

我们不需要她
We don't need her.

529
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,870
你去跟内森说啊

然后拿着我们的筹码去见投资商
then show investors when we have leverage.

534
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,430
你对她说了什么
What'd you say to her?

535
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,020
你做了什么
What'd you do?

00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,240
我知道他会出红桃A
I know he's gonna cash the heart ace

539
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,320
拿方片飞
and take the diamond finesse.

540
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,100
可他却把明手牌里的黑桃丢出去
Instead, he discards spade from the dummy

541
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,100
拿皇后打
and plays the queen.

542
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,280
我就说"纳威  你是喜欢红人队吗"
I'm like, "Neville, are you a Redskins fan?"

543
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,110
懂吗
You know?

544
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,800
伙计  你还好吗
Hey, man, are you all right?

545
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,240
你真该一起来
I'm telling you, you oughta think about joining 'cause 

546
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,130
我真是不想再给这些
I'm getting tired of carrying cards

547
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:06,270
北方佬和天主教徒拿牌了
for these damn Yanks and mackerel snappers.

548
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,000
老天啊
Aw, man.

549
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:24,960
你没事吧
Are you all right?

550
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,580
谢天谢地
Oh, thank Christ.

551
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,810
我就跟薇姬说  那些树枝得修剪了啊
I mean, I told Vicky they have got to trim those branches.

552
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,860
人行道被树挡得严严实实
How are you supposed to see cross traffic

553
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,680
叫人怎么看交叉车流啊
when the sidewalk's a damn jungle?

554
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,530
你被解雇了
You're fired.

555
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:39,940
什么
What?

556
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:43,890
你被解雇了
You're fired.

557
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,530
地址计算码太长了
The address calculation code. It's too long.

558
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,110
占用太多字节
It takes up too many bytes.

559
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:10,960
我需要想个办法  抓取地址
What I need is some way of grabbing the addresses

560
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,530
而不用告诉CPU去哪找这个地址
without telling the CPU where to look for them,

561
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:16,440
就像一个同时是地图的地址簿
like an address book that's also a map.

562
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,120
卡梅伦
Cameron...

563
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,010
你来这儿干什么
why are you here?

564
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,290
我想不出了
I'm stuck.

565
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,030
又干到很晚吗
Another late night, huh?

566
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,430
戈登  你流血了
Gordon, you're bleeding. 

567
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:48,420
听到了吗
You hear that? 

568
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:51,720
它还活着
It's alive.

569
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,030
我给动物管理处打了电话
I called Animal Control.

570
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,860
他们说最仁慈的办法就是直接杀了它
They said the kindest thing is to just kill it.

571
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,700
-或许你可以...  -唐娜
- Maybe you could-- - Look, Donna, 

572
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,830
我不会出去的
I'm not going back out there.

573
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,670
-我今天真的很不顺  -好吧
- I've had kind of a day. - Okay--

574
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,400
我会脱下鞋
I'm gonna take off my shoes, 

575
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,760
去吻女儿  然后去洗洗
kiss the girls, and wash up,

576
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,020
好吗
all right?

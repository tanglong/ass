是的  我想叫辆车去伊顿微技术实验室
Yeah, I need a taxi to take me to Eaton Microtech Labs.

2
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,240
不  我不是本地人
Oh, I'm not from here.

3
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,330
你能让那个叫法国名的男人替我叫车吗
Can you get the guy with the French name on that?

4
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,290
对对  就是礼宾员
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Mr. Concierge.

It's alive, it's alive, it's alive.

8
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,240
你今早能回家太好了  谢谢你
I really appreciate you coming home this morning. Thank you.

9
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,790
我还得洗个澡刮刮脸赶紧去上班
I gotta shower and shave and get back to the office.

10
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,550
我是想让你看看这个
I just wanted to bring you this.

- You were quoted several times. - Oh, you mean...

13
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,810
引述了"苏珊·费尔柴德"的话吗
"Susan Fairchild" Was quoted?

14
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,590
-法式吐司  今天什么日子  -我爸的生日
- French toast. What's the occasion? - Dad's birthday.

15
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,130
我还以为你是特地回家祝寿呢
I thought that's why you came home.

16
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:45,820
你送给他一支球杆
You got him a putter.

17
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,190
瞧瞧  什么风把你刮回来了
Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in.

18
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,470
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

19
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,580
他可喜欢你送的球杆了
He loves the putter.

20
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,960
你道谢了吗  亲爱的
Did you thank him, sweetheart?

21
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,440
今天跟我去俱乐部打一局吧
You should come to the club with me today. Play a quick nine?

我...还得上班去呢
Um, I gotta-- I got work I gotta do.

23
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,180
早上好啊  女儿们
Good morning, girls.

24
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,040
两天没见我了
Hey, no hello for Daddy,

25
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,740
都不跟爸爸打招呼吗
who you haven't seen in almost two days?

26
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,150
爸爸好
Hi, Daddy.

27
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,900
我们能带这个上学去吗
Can we take this to school?

28
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,080
-是计算器吗  -不  是电视
- Is it a calculator? - No, it's a TV.

29
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,310
你说这小玩意多厉害
Isn't that thing incredible?

30
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,980
是啊  这下可以整天黏在电视上了
Yeah, now they can watch TV all the time.

31
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,250
我刚和华族签了份独家协议
I just arranged an exclusive deal with Kazoku

32
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,510
把这玩意收进我们的秋季新品目录里
to carry them in our fall catalogue.

33
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,080
祝我生日快乐  是吧
Happy birthday to me, right?

34
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,850
你的电脑和IBM  XT相比怎么样
Well, how will your computer compare to the IBM XT?

35
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,080
我们的电脑不仅有IBM的全部优点
Ours has all the same features as the XT,

36
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,960
还另有额外的优势
plus-- plus a few bonus extras.

37
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,020
-比如呢  -比如
- Like what? - Like what?

38
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,090
比如你能带着这电脑去开房
Like you can haul it down to the no-tell motel

39
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,160
一边干你的秘书
when you screw your secretary

40
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,990
一边打你的备忘录
and you'd still get your memos typed up.

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,650
就比如这个
"Like what?"

42
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,400
你要是想拿IBM电脑玩这套
You try that with an IBM PC,

43
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,330
当心闪了老腰
hell, you'd throw out your back.

44
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,870
说说你们电脑的速度吧
Now, what about speed?

45
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,720
我们的顾客似乎只关心这个
That seems to be all our customers care about.

46
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,570
-我听说你们正在鼓捣286  -嗯
- I heard you guys were flirting with the 286. - Yeah.

47
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,060
我只是个纽约来的投机客
Oh, I'm just a carpetbagger from New York.

48
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,890
他们才不会信我
They won't listen to me.

49
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,890
先生们  我想所有的相关参数
Gentlemen, I think-- I think all the specs

50
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,210
都在你们手中的资料集里了
are right there in those packets that we gave you.

51
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,060
你们都认字吧
Y'all can read, right?

52
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,370
首先  我要澄清一下
First of all, to clarify,

53
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,630
包养小秘的费用不包括在电脑售价里
secretary isn't included at that price.

54
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,390
至于具体参数  我们的确在拿286试验
As for the specs, we were experimenting with the 286,

55
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,780
但如果真用286  你们的顾客得卖肾了
but in the end, it would only cost your customers an arm and a leg,

56
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,460
所以我们要用8兆赫兹的8086处理器
so we're going with an eight megahertz 8086.

57
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,960
这样不仅速度比市面上的产品快一倍
That's almost twice as fast as any PC on the market,

58
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,300
我们还集成了浮点运算协处理器
plus we're including a floating-point math coprocessor

59
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,110
其性能足以把IBM所有产品甩出几条街
that will run circles around any IBM PC.

60
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,110
我不妨开门见山
Let's cut to the chase

61
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,510
直截了当地回答你们想问的问题
and get to the question you came here to have answered.

62
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,190
而你们的总裁也会在
The question your CEO 

63
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,810
计算机分销商展览后的会议上问这个问题
will ask you at your post-COMDEX powwow.

64
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,410
"第三排货架上该摆什么货"
"What do we put on our third shelf?"

65
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,160
不是第一排  那是留给IBM的
Not the first shelf-- that's reserved for IBM.

66
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,700
甚至不是第二排
Not even the second shelf.

67
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,960
那是留给你们的品牌电脑的
That's where your name brand computer goes.

68
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,020
就是在台湾组装  再贴上你们标签的电脑
The ones you have manufactured in Taiwan and slap your insignia on.

69
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,700
我说的是第三排
The third shelf.

70
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,650
杂牌电脑
The "Kludge" Shelf.

71
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,430
连理货勤杂工都不看好
The shelf your stock boys detest...

72
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,570
因为那些电脑太笨重
because the computers are so heavy...

73
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,620
又放在那么下面
and the shelves are so low.

74
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,470
那才是我们的位置
That's the shelf we're talking about.

75
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,550
这才是我们这些笨蛋的市场  对吗
That's the shelf us schmucks are aiming for, am I right?

76
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,400
不对
Wrong.

77
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,020
这不是一款IBM兼容克隆机
This isn't an IBM compatible clone.

78
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,210
这是新的兼容机
This is the new compatible.

79
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,840
IBM到时候得模仿我们
IBM will have to clone us.

80
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,510
把这话转达给你们总裁  我保证明年这时候
Tell that to your CEO and I promise you this time next year,

81
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,280
坐在总裁位子上的就是你们  问着
you'll be sitting in his chair asking,

82
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,190
我们在第三排架子上放什么
"What do we put on our third shelf?"

83
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,970
欢迎回来  旅行愉快吗
Welcome back. How was your trip?

84
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,450
-这都谁啊  -新来的软件工程师
- Who are all these people? - New team of software engineers.

85
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,650
这位是史蒂夫  软件开发部经理
This is Steve, our software development manager.

86
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,260
史蒂夫  这是卡梅伦
Steve, this is Cameron.

87
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,050
你的事我都跟他们说过了
I told them all about you.

88
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,400
但你没说她是女的
You didn't tell me she was a girl.

89
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,500
我就知道以你敏锐的分析能力一定猜得到
I knew your keen analytical skills would sniff it out.

90
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,770
把这些拿给戈登
Run those to Gordon.

91
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,890
我自己就能搞定所有软件
Look, I can handle all the software myself.

92
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,780
我在飞机上都设计好了
I already mapped out the design on the plane.

93
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,100
谁让你做的
Who told you to do that?

94
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,270
没谁  我只是以为...
No one. I thought that --

95
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,740
你以为这种大工程都怎么开展啊
Why? How do you think a project this big works?

96
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,420
在博斯沃思许可的范围内  人越多越好
Throwing as many people at the problem as Bosworth will approve.

97
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,100
你让我去辛辛那提旅游
Wait, did you send me to Cincinnati

98
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,930
就是为了
so that you could hire

99
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,740
背着我雇史蒂夫和他的小仆从吗
Steve and his little minions behind my back?

100
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,640
你想多了
Don't be paranoid. 

101
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,770
我让你去辛辛那提是因为你需要休息
I sent you to Cincinnati 'cause you needed the rest.

102
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,540
写BIOS代码差点把你累死
Writing the BIOS almost killed you.

103
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,250
你们起好名字了吗
Have you guys thought of a name yet?

104
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,010

You couldn't fit this crap in a gym bag.

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,560
那就关吧  斯坦
Then turn it off, Stan.

137
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,000
这是什么
What the hell is this?

138
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,310
我要的是故障分析报告
I asked you to do a failure analysis report.

139
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,270
我做了啊
I did.

140
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,280
怎么回事  让我看看行吗
I don't understand. Can I see that?

141
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,310
在这儿  混在我写的补充报告里了
It's here. It got mixed up with the supplemental report I did.

142
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,920
好  谢了
Okay, thanks.

143
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,140
下次把我需要的报告放在最上面
Next time, just make sure the report I need is on top.

144
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,620
{\an8}卡迪夫电子便携个人电脑  工作随时随地

145
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,170
如果去掉风扇  就会有散热问题
If we get rid of fans, we have a heat problem.

146
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,710
如果去掉协处理器  浮点运算速度就会下降
If we get rid of the coprocessor, we lose floating-point speed.

147
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,580
能减轻机身重量
That'll get weight out of the case.

148
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,880
至多就能减轻一两磅
That'll give us one, two pounds max.

149
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,000
乔想把重量减掉10磅
Joe wants this to be 10 pounds lighter.

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,530
我还希望我老婆减掉10磅呢
Yeah, I want my wife to be 10 pounds lighter.

151
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,340
生活不就得妥协
Life is about compromise.

152
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,040
我不是开玩笑  艾德
This isn't a joke, Ed.

153
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,930
一切都指着我们造好这台电脑呢
Everything is riding on us getting this right.

154
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,100
不做成谁都不许走  明白吗
And no one's leaving here until we do, you got that?

155
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,370
好诶  流浪者队得分
Yes. Rangers scored.

156
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,230
-表给我  -放松

158
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,520
下午3点就喝啤酒吗

'Cause that can be arranged.

160

抱歉
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,760
要是我们把显像管显示器换成液晶显示器呢
What if we swapped out the CRT for an LCD?

162
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,620
液晶屏更轻便
It's lighter and smaller.

163
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,360
但远远超出预算
And way over our budget.

164
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,150
找关系就不会
Not if you know a guy.

165

我是莱夫  那位是肯尼斯
I'm Lev. That's Kenneth,

168
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,850
不过大家都叫他悠悠球
but everyone calls him Yo-Yo.

169
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,160
-你在打游戏吗  -老天  你干什么啊
- Are you playing games? - Jesus, do you mind?

170
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,390
我给你的任务是写打印驱动程序  不是玩游戏
I assigned you to write print drivers, not play games.

171
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,290
-什么  什么时候的事  -你没看分工表吗
- What, when? - Well, didn't you check the flowchart?

172
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,880
我分配了所有的子程序任务
I mapped out all the subroutine assignments 

173
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,870
以及完成任务的顺序
and which order to do them in.

174
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,630
打印驱动是边角料  我为什么不能做编译器
Print drivers are remedial. Why aren't I working on a compiler?

175
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,700
因为我已经有个团队在做了  这是其一
Because I already have a team on it, number one.

176
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,100
第二  据说代码存档的事不能交给你
Number two, I hear you can't be trusted to document your code,

177
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,180
第三  你得把自己的代码好好存档
and, number three, I need you to document your code.

178
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,560
欢迎来到衰人俱乐部

一听你敲键盘就猜来了
I could tell by your keystrokes.

184
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,600
那玩意上瘾的
That thing's heroin.

185
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,480
期末考前一晚逃了研讨班打游戏
Took out my graduate seminar the night before our final.

186
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,730
结果全部挂科
We all flunked.

187
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,930
悠悠球  我要把这个放在主机上
Hey, Yo-Yo, I'm putting this up on the mainframe,

188
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,180
跟你说一声啊
so consider yourself warned.

出来得正是时候
Perfect time for you to come out.

190
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,040
周末长假  所以这儿很空
This place empties out for the long weekend.

191
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,150
不会影响别人的比赛
You won't slow down anyone's game.

192
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,800
你给孩子们买的华族表真是个好礼物
That was a really nice gift you got the girls, the Kazoku watch.

193
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,430
我知道你觉得我宠坏她们了
I know you think I spoil them.

194
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,790
没有  你就该宠她们
No, no, you should spoil them.

195
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,890
看来你和华族电子的人
It sounds like you got a really good relationship

196

and I finally get it for you and now you're saying no.

244
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,970
华族的屏幕怎么就月亮了
How is Kazoku's screen the moon?

245
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,110
他们研发出了领先液晶屏技术

你要求电脑不超过12磅
You want our computer to be under 12 pounds

247
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,450

248
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,570

then to dinner if you're interested.

270
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,690
或许吧
Yeah, maybe.

271
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,420
活儿干得怎么样了
Now, how are we doing over here?

272
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,400
我干完了
I'm finished.

273
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,740
你在分工表上登记了吗
Did you check off your module on the flowchart?

274
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,390
没有  我都说我做完了
No, just told you I'm finished.

275
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,210
你还是得去签个名
Well, I still need you to put a check by your name.

276
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,210
这是规程
It's part of the protocol.

277
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,450
我在斯坦福商学院学到的
Learned it at Stanford B-School.

278
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,730
是废话学院吧
Does the B stand for bullshit?

279
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,560
有问题就来我办公室
If you have a problem, you can come by my office

280
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,460
我们像成年人一样好好讨论
and we can discuss it like adults.

281
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,100
没必要发火
No need to get your panties in a wad.

282
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,100
{\pos(235,275)}内裤

283
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,960
我没有穿内裤
Oh, I'm not wearing any panties.

284
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,290
让你的分工表见鬼去吧
But you can stick that in your flowchart.

285
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,310
你得把那混蛋弄走
You have to get rid of that tool.

286
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,050
-哪个  -我没开玩笑  他是个糟糕的经理
- Which one? - I'm not kidding. He's a terrible manager.

287
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,220
简直是舍大取小
He can't see the forest for the trees.

288
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,410
你得把他撵走
You have to get rid of him.

289
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,160
我不用做任何事  你得学着与人合作
I don't have to do anything. Learn to work with people.

290
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,260
他让编程最快的人去写驱动
He's assigning drivers to the fastest coders

291
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,120
却让笨蛋去写编译器  太没效率了
and compilers to the lunkheads. It's inefficient.

292
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,320
放过他吧  他压力很大
Cut him some slack. He's under a lot of pressure.

293
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,060
什么...我能应对这压力
What-- I could handle the pressure.

294
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,520
这很难想象吗
Why is that so crazy?

295
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,050
这么说吧  你不善交际
Let's see-- you're not exactly a people person.

296
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,290
你没有任何管理经验  甚至是工作经验
You have no management experience or any job experience, really.

297
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,060
你从大学辍学
You dropped out of college...

298
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,610
那是因为你求我  混蛋
Because you begged me, asshole.

299
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,330
而且缺乏专业精神
...and you lack professionalism.

300
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,730
合格的经理不会辱骂上级
A manager doesn't swear at his superior,

301
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,880
更不会开着门骂
certainly not with his office door open.

302
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,740
这样更专业一点了吗
Is that more professional?

303
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,110
如果我让你错以为
Look, if I've given you the impression

304
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,060
因为我们的关系
that because of this thing we've got going on

305
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,940
你可以享有特别待遇  那我向你道歉
that you're entitled to special treatment, I'm sorry.

306
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,700
卡梅伦  你干什么
Cameron, what are you doing?

307
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:42,880
我只是想彻底结束"我们的关系"
I'm just taking this little thing we've got going off the table.

308
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,730
也许这能让你清醒点
Maybe that'll wake you up.

309
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:52,320
我落了点东西在你公寓
Uh, I left some stuff at your apartment, so...

310
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,230
你可以告诉史蒂夫我明天再来上班
you can tell Steve I'll report for duty tomorrow.

311
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,870
我听说他们不指望西方人会鞠躬
I read that they don't expect Westerners to bow,

312
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,610
但认为你应当双手接过他们的名片
but you're supposed to receive their business cards with both hands.

313
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,210
以示尊重
It's a sign of respect.

314
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,500
我去过东京9次
I've been to Tokyo nine times.

315
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,270
我是戈登·克拉克  很高兴见到你们
Gordon Clark. It's a pleasure to meet you.

316
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,280
是我们的荣幸
The pleasure is ours.

317
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,860
-我是武田康彦  -谢谢
- Hirohiko Taketa. - Thank you.

318
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,150
我是武田康彦
Hirohiko Taketa.

319
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,790
"武田康彦  华族电子国际销售主管"
"Hirohiko Taketa, head of International Sales, Kazoku Electronics."

320
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,110
武田先生  谢谢您今晚前来
Mr. Taketa, thank you for being our guest tonight.

321
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,720
为了盖瑞·埃默森的女婿  在所不辞
We would do anything for the son-in-law of Gary Emerson.

322
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,580
我...是盖瑞的女婿
I-I-I'm Gary's son-in-law.

323
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,090
是
Oh, hai.

324
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,710
抱歉  希望我没吓到你
Oh, sorry. Hope I didn't scare you.

325
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,070
我是乔·麦克米伦
I'm Joe MacMillan.

326
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,080
我认识乔·麦克米伦
I know Joe MacMillan.

327
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,020
我是老的那个  他是我儿子
Senior. He's my son.

328
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,840
你知道乔什么时候回来吗
Do you know when Joe will be back?

329
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,360
不知道  他...你怎么进来的
Uh, no, he's-- how did you get in here?

330
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,690
我给管理员看了我的证件
I showed the super my license.

331
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,420
如果说话的腔调像模像样
You say something with the right authority,

332
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,410
一般就能如愿以偿
you generally get what you want.

333
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,750
真有意思
Huh, that's fascinating.

334
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,830
我只是过来拿我东西的
I'm just here to get my stuff.

335
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,970
这球棒是我给他买的
I bought this bat for him.

336
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,480
还花了好长时间教他如何正确挥棒
Spent hours teaching him how to swing correctly.

337
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,560
他没这方面天赋
He wasn't exactly a natural.

338
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,020
我不知道乔有女朋友
Didn't know Joe had a girlfriend.

339
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,940
我不是他女朋友
I'm not his girlfriend.

340
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,750
乔的确不是会交女朋友的那种
Well, Joe's not exactly the girlfriend type.

341
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,520
他做了什么让你那么生他的气
So, what did he do to make you so mad at him?

342
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,380
他又做了什么让你那么生他的气
What did he do to make you so mad at him?

343
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,510
他是这么跟你说的吗
Is that what he told you?

344
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,940
不是  他从未提起过你
No, he never talks about you.

345
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,710
但如果你得靠骗管理员才能进他公寓
But if you had to lie to the super to get into his apartment,

346
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,610
我猜你们俩关系并不是很好
I'm guessing you're not exactly chummy.

347
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,840
说得真对
Touch?

348
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,460
事实上  他下午放了我鸽子
Actually, he stood me up this afternoon.

349
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,970
也许我们可以边喝边聊
Maybe we could commiserate over a drink.

350
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,480
谢谢  但我得走了
Thanks, but I've got to get going.

351
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,140
约了人吗
Someone waiting for you?

352
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,340
嗯
Yeah.

353
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,220
见到你很高兴  你是
Well, it was nice to meet you, Miss--

354
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,470
你还没说你叫什么
you know, I never caught your name.

355
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,290
卡梅伦
Cameron.

356
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,800
不是卡梅伦·豪伊吧
Not Cameron Howe?

357
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,760
你怎么知道我名字的
How do you know my name?

358
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,630
我的手下回到纽约后
When my guys came back to New York,

359
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,980
都念念不忘一个叫卡梅伦·豪伊的天才
they couldn't stop talking about this prodigy named Cameron Howe.

360
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,380
-得了吧  -真的
- Right. - Oh, yes.

361
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,690
他们说你是当代的艾达·拉芙蕾丝
They said you're the modern Ada Lovelace.

362
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,740
明天我要搭乘20小时的航班
Tomorrow, I'm taking a 20-hour flight 

363
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,780
和比尔·盖茨去香港  他肯定要唠叨个不停
to Hong Kong with Bill Gates and he's gonna talk circles around me and 

364
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,120
我想喝一杯壮壮胆
I could use some liquid courage.

365
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,220
可我又不想一个人喝
I hate to drink alone.

366
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,950
别管我  我是想查查
Don't mind me, I'm just gonna check

367
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,270
今天天气什么样
the weather report on the local news.

368
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:29,410
真是工程杰作
No, but it's-- it's really an amazing work of engineering.

369
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,440
我只有一个问题  你们怎么做到放大屏幕
The one question I have is how do you scale this to a bigger size 

370
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,150
而不让它模糊的
without the display blurring?

371
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,730
调高电压
Oh, we make the voltage higher.

372
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,190
调高5伏通常就够了
Five volts usually enough, yeah.

373
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,510
可是电压那么高  往屏幕上投射一个像素
But if you zap a pixel with a voltage that high,

374
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,760
周围的像素都会扭曲  那不就重影了吗
the adjacent pixels twist, too. Don't you get ghosting?

375
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,980
要是加上第三层微电容呢
What if you laid in a third layer of microcapacitors?

376
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,130
这种技术你们不是已经试验过了吗
Aren't you experimenting with that technology already?

377
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,380
索尼试过了
Sony is.

378
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,840
那样价钱更高
It would cost you more.

379
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,780
-也许  -我们定价不能过高
- Well, maybe-- - We can't drive up the price

380
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,810
导致失去竞争力  我们的提议是
till we're no longer competitive. Here's our offer.

381
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,690
降低你们每台显示器的利润
You take a lower margin on the individual screens,

382
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,330
但是最终的利润给你们分成
we'll give you a percentage of our profits on the back end.

383
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,410
我已经尽力了  而且说实话
It's the best I can do, and, frankly,

384
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,650
别的个人电脑厂家
I don't think you'll get a better deal 

385
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,720
不会有更好的提议了
from another PC manufacturer.

386
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,210
-干杯  -干杯
- Kanpai. - Kanpai.

387
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,410
慢点
Easy.

388
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,650
还有谁卡在这个变态的过道迷宫里了吗
Is anyone else stuck in the maze of twisty little passages?

389
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,050
扔一件物品试试
Try dropping an item.

390
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,210
什么
What?

391
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,320
有个海盗袭击了我  把装备抢了
A pirate just pounced on me and stole my treasure.

392
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:51,060
不不不  你闭嘴
No, no, no, no, you shut up!

393
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,880
你全家都语法错误
You have bad grammar.

394
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,600
你跟我走
You, come with me.

395
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,780
-我吗  -是你
- Me? - Yeah, you.

396
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,970
随便谁  所有人
Any of you. All of you.

397
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,260
快点  都进来
Get your asses in here, come on.

398
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,720
快点
Come on.

399
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,020
过来  进来
Come here, get in.

400
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,310
我他妈怎么从这洞里出去
How the hell do I get out of this godforsaken cave?

401
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,460
很期待与你合作
Really looking forward to working with you.

402
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,750
是
Hai.

403
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:30,160
做销售的不理解我们的工作
And the sales guys, they don't get what we do.

404
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,120
没法体会其中的艺术
You know, the artistry that's involved.

405
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,160
他们只在乎利润
All they care about's profit.

406
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,190
比如我岳父
Take my father-in-law.

407
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,150
你仔细翻过《刀锋》吗
Have you ever even looked through the "Razor's Edge"?

408
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,150
那家伙净卖些次品
I mean, you wouldn't believe the schlock that guy sells.

409
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,050
次品  很差的东西
Schlock, you know, like stupid stuff.

410
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,210
是
Hai.

411

00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,350
我看你包上有空军的徽章
I noticed an Air Force pin on your backpack.

414
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,130
-你爸爸的吗  -嗯
- Your father's? - Yeah.

415

直升机机工长

那活儿不好干
Tough job.

418
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,490
太平洋战争时  我是海军军官
I was a naval officer in the Pacific.

419
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,700
没想到如今我每月都要飞去东京
If anyone had told me one day I'd be flying to Tokyo 

420
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,410
低头哈腰...
every month and bowing to them...

421
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,680
你什么时候开始在IBM工作的
So, when did you start working for IBM?

422
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,010
1945年我被招去研发马克一号Oh, they recruited me in 1945 to work on the Mark I.

423
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,010

和葛丽丝·霍普一起吗  你见到她了
With Grace Hopper? Did you meet her?

我还是不明白乔为什么要离开公司
And I still don't understand what possessed Joe to leave.

432
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,120
我很惊讶你拒绝了我们
I was surprised you turned us down.

433

你本可以成为下一个葛丽丝·霍普
You could've been the next Grace Hopper.

Oh, my God, you're right.

437
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,390
我真不该去给全新的电脑写软件
Yeah, instead of writing software for a brand-new machine,

438
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,880
而是该去给

我怎么想的啊
What was I thinking?

441
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,980
对不起  我太过分了
Yeah, I'm sorry. That was out of line.

442
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,670
我不是在生你的气
You're not the one I'm angry at.

他没能活着回来  对吧
He didn't make it back, did he?

00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,870
你当时肯定连十岁都不到
You couldn't have been more than 10 years old at the time.

449
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,970

I-- excuse me.

他们付了账单
They picked up the check.

451
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:56,200
你醉到看不出来这代表他们不跟我们合作了吗
Are you too drunk to comprehend that means they're done with us?

452
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,640
我就不该让你来
I should never have let you come.

No, Gary did, and then you insulted him.

455
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,620
说你自己岳父的坏话
Nothing says, "Don't trust us"

456
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,670
就等于是告诉别人"别相信我们"
quite like bad-mouthing your own father-in-law.

457
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,790
你爸爸在IBM工作
Look, your father works at IBM

你整天到处

00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,740
-说他们坏话  -没跟日本人说
- to everyone. - Not to the Japanese.

460
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,380
技术你是厉害
Look, you may be good with a soldering iron,

461
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,880
但谈生意
but when it comes to business,

462
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,740
考虑大局  你什么都不懂
the big picture, you have no idea.

463
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,950
跟那个疯女人上床的可不是我
Hey, hey. I'm not the one screwing "Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs."

464
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,230
-别提她  -这事将来肯定要毁了我们
- Leave her out of this. - Like that's not gonna blow up in our face!

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,730
回去跟其他工作人员一起待着吧
Go back to your workstation with the rest of the grunts.

466
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,050
我明早解决这个问题
I'll fix this in the morning.

467
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,160
怎么解决  凭你的三寸不烂之舌吗
With what, Joe, your words?

468
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,260
唐娜说得对  你只会夸夸其谈
Donna was right. You're all hat and no cattle.

469
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,840
那你怎么不和唐娜一起搭建个电脑
Why don't you build a computer with Donna?

470
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,890
对了  你们失败了
Oh, wait, you tried that.

471
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,320
你爸爸会杀了我的
Your dad's gonna kill me.

472
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,590
肯定没你想得那么糟
Well, I bet it wasn't as bad as you think.

473
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,440
就是这么糟
Look, I'm telling you, it was.

474
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,650
我这次真的搞砸了
I really screwed the pooch this time.

475
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,810
肯定会有解决方法的
Well, I'm sure it'll work out somehow.

476
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,430
亲爱的  我烤箱里还烤着派呢
Oh, honey, I've got pies in the oven.

477
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,540
-等你回家我们再谈吧  -好吧
- We can talk more about this when you get home. - Okay.

478
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,520
好吧  那我...
Okay, yeah, I'll--

479

怎么了  戈登
What, Gordon?

480
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,950
我是亨特
Uh, it's Hunt.

481

我打得不是时候吗
Am I catching you at a bad time?

482
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:32,480
不不不  时候很好
No, no, no. It's wonderful.

483
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,390
我是说  有事吗
I mean... what's up?

484
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,550
我打给你是因为
Well, the reason I'm calling is 'cause 

485
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:42,210
我看了你的另一份报告
I had a chance to go over that other report of yours,

486
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,640
写得很好
and I wanna say I was really impressed.

487
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,610
很高兴你能这么积极
I love that you took the initiative.

488
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,290
谢谢
Well, thank you.

489
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,100
那个
Listen...

490
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,280
我想跟你道歉  那天不该冲你发火
I wanted to apologize for snapping at you the other day.

491
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,800
上边骂了我  没办法
I was getting hammered from upstairs and, what can I say?

492
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,990
但我不该拿你撒气
I shouldn't have taken it out on you.

493
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,430
没事的
Oh, it's no big deal, really. I just 

494
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,320
我回家还吼我女儿了呢
yelled at my kids when I got home.

495
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,700
孩子不就干这个用的吗
Well, that's what they're there for.

496
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,440
我不想再叨扰
Well, I don't want to cut into your evening 

497
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,690
你晚上休息了
any more than I already have.

498
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:15,840
没有  我在做桃子派呢
Oh, no, I'm just making some peach pies

499
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,600
给我父母烧烤派对准备的
for my parents' barbecue.

500
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,260
桃子派啊
Peach pies?

501
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,540
我可喜欢了
I love peach pie.

502
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,850
你往面团里掺伏特加吗
Do you put vodka in your dough?

503
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,120
伏特加
Vodka?

504
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,780
我奶奶  她会
My granny, she used to

505
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,690
放一半水  一半伏特加
substitute half the water for a shot of vodka.

506
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,550
她说这样硬皮就不会因为水果馅
She said it kept the crust from getting all soggy

507
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,600
而变得软绵绵的
from the fruit filling.

508
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,980
我倒觉得她是为万一派做得不好
I think she did it so if her pie didn't turn out,

509
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,730
大家也都醉醺醺的  尝不出来
everyone would be too drunk to notice.

510
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,910
她听上去好机智啊
Oh, well, she sounds like a smart lady.

511
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,680
是啊  她最好了
Yeah, she was the best.

512
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,240
那...
Well, I...

513
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,540
就不打扰你做派了
better let you get back to bakin'.

514
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:00,580
如果还有剩  回头给我拿点来吧
If you have any left over, feel free to save me a slice.

515
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,200
好啊  明天见
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

516
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,980
晚安  唐娜
Good night, Donna.

517
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,620
能让他早上再找你吗  现在不是时候
Can he call you in the morning? Now's not a really good time.

518
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,430
是急事
It's kinda urgent.

519
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,090
亲爱的  能到门口来一下吗
Sweetheart, can you come to the door for a second?

520
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,690
我们在主持比赛之夜
We're hosting game night.

521
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,300
真有趣
Fun.

522
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:40,970
他喝醉了
He's drunk.

523
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,570
怎么回事
What happened?

524
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,800
你没事吧
Are you okay?

525
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:14,290
-抱歉  我一般不...  -没事的
- Sorry, I don't usually... - No, it's perfectly all right.

526
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,110
我猜你工作压力一定很大
I think you're under a lot of stress at work.

527
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,850
乔看错你了
Joe's all wrong about you.

528
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,310
乔的错误有很多
Joe's wrong about a lot of things.

529
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,620
他什么时候会放弃这一切啊
How close is he to giving up on all this?

530
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,080
不好说  他看上去挺有决心的
I don't know. He's pretty determined.

531
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,700
他刚刚背着我雇了一堆程序员
He just hired a whole team of programmers

532
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,790
和一个经理
and a manager behind my back.

533
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,570
气死我了
Really pissed me off.

534
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:46,150
我真不想这么说  但乔就这样
I hate to say it, but that sounds like Joe.

535
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,170
他在IBM也这么干过吗
Did he pull this at IBM?

536
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,950
总是如此
All the time.

537
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,340
你知道他在IBM的三次升职是怎么得到的吗
You know how he got his three promotions at IBM?

538
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,740
强取
He took them.

539
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,600
一次  他对一位上司撒谎
One time, he actually lied to a supervisor--

540
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,910
那人都跟我们干了20年了
guy who'd been with us for over 20 years--

541
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,720
跟他说他就要被解雇了
warned him that he was going to be let go

542
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,090
强烈建议他自己辞职
and then strongly suggested that he tender his resignation to 

543
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,120
以保住面子
maintain his dignity.

544
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,260
那可怜人就信了
Poor guy believed him.

545
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,100
如果说话的腔调像模像样
Well, if you say something with the right authority,

546
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,860
一般就能如愿以偿
you generally get what you want.

547
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,900
你真是满嘴胡话
You're so full of shit.

548
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,430
你真觉得我就会乖乖
What, did you actually think I was gonna roll over

549
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,610
跑去告诉乔你是个大好人吗
and just tell Joe what a great guy you were?

550
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,190
你俩都是混蛋
You're both disgusting.

551
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,360
我看你并不清楚
I don't think you understand 

552
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,220
你是跟什么样的人搅在了一起
who you've gotten into bed with.

553
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:43,470
他迟早会毁了一切
It's only a matter of time until he blows everything up.

554
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,430
他向来如此
He always does.

555
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,160
-那你肯定最清楚了  -我给了他一切
- Well, you would know. - I gave him the world...

556
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,050
他却羞辱我
and he spat in my face.

557
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,290
他觉得一切都该是他的
He thinks everything belongs to him...

558
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,840
也包括你
you included.

559
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,180

For when you figure that out.

我们昨晚犯了错

我们冒犯了你们  为此  我十分抱歉
We offended you, and for that, I am sorry.

564
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,490
克拉克先生没脸来见你们
Mr. Clark was too ashamed to come,

565
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:47,150
所以我答应会替他表示道歉
so I promised I would apologize on his behalf

566
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,290
他很抱歉他喝醉了  还让你们觉得
for getting drunk, for giving the impression

567
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,090
他不尊重他的岳父
that he doesn't respect his father-in-law,

568
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:54,530
本来就是他岳父好心替我们安排了这次见面
the man who was gracious enough to put us into contact with you.

569
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,130
但其实他绝无轻慢的意思
That is not the case. Not for him,

570
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,990
我更没有
and certainly not for me

571

我可以毫不夸张地说
I'm m not exaggeratg when I say

572
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,790
如果不是我父亲  我不会有今日的成就
that I wouldn't be where I am today if it weren't for my father.

573
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,290
我从他母校一毕业
The day I graduated from his alma mater,

574
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:10,320
他就带我进了他的公司  IBM
he brought me into his company, IBM.

575
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,830
他教会了我一切一切
He taught me the ropes. He taught me everything I know.

576
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,580
他要我全力以赴
He told me to swing for the fences 

577
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,290
从此我就一直在努力
and I've never stopped swinging.

578
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,050
我知道这么跑来很冒险
I know it's a risk showing up like this,

579
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,160
但我愿尽一切努力
but I will do anything

580
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,830
争取让你们再考虑跟我们合作

我看完了
I'm done with that.

585

别费事了
Oh, don't bother.

586
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,440
-你被解雇了  -你说什么
- You're fired. - Excuse you?

587
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,050
倒不是因为你是个混蛋  虽然你的确是
Oh, and it's not 'cause you're a tool, which you are.

588
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,340
你不能解雇我  我是你上司
You can't fire me. I'm your boss.

Do you want all your software programmed in 11 weeks

00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:13,970
而且开销减半吗
for half of what you're spending?

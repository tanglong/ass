1
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,840
搞什么
What the hell?

2
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,240
飓风艾丽西娅即将登陆
...Alicia's arrival is imminent,

3
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,930
目前正向西行进

4
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,270
风速即将达到75英里

5
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,330
并预计将在

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,490
明天凌晨登陆前  突破这一速度
before reaching shore sometime late tomorrow morning.

7
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,680
有报道称  石油公司用直升机
Reports of oil company employees

8
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,840
疏散了飓风行进路线上的
being evacuated by helicopter

9
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,610
海上钻井平台工作人员
from offshore rigs in the path of the storm

10
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,450
这消息加剧了公众的恐慌情绪
have punctuated the fear and trepidation that's felt by many.

11
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,870
先进计算机可能...
Advanced computer probability...

12
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,050
等等  等等
Hold on, wait. Wait.

13
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,360
-怎么了  -这些...
- What's wrong? - Where did you--

14
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,300
这些伤疤到底哪来的
how did you get these?

15
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,740
别骗我
Really?

16
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,340
我上高中的时候
I was in high school.

17
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,460
攒了好久的钱
I'd been saving up money for a long time.

18
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,670
暑期打工什么的
Summer jobs and everything.

19
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,510
我买了辆64年的雪佛兰
And I bought a '64 Chevy Nova.

20
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,350
明黄色  一眼就看中了
Bright yellow, love at first sight.

21
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,290
拿到车的那天  我带几个朋友出去兜风
The day I got it, I took some friends out.

22
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,150
当时是二月中旬  天气很冷  非常冷
And it was mid-February and cold. I mean, bitter cold.

23
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,490
路上结了冰  那种晚上不该出去的
Ice on the roads. No one should've been out that night.

24
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,530
等等
Hold on.

25
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,330
是真的吗
Is this true?

26
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,080
什么意思
What do you mean?

27
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,990
你在骗我
You're lying to me.

28
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,940
好吧
Okay.

29
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,840
天啊
Oh, my God.

30
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,660
真相是...天呐  这可真丢人
The truth is-- God, this is embarrassing.

31
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,450
我小时候有个朋友
When I was a kid, I had a buddy

32
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,520
住在农圃道上
who lived out on this farm road

33
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,360
有座很老旧的磨坊
and there was this mill rusted to hell.

34
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,070
一天我挑衅他  说"迈克..."
One day I dared him. I said, "Mike"--

35
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,560
天啊  别说了
Oh, my God. Stop.

36
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,320
这又是谎话吗
Is this another lie?

37
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,960
说真的  你问这干吗  卡梅伦
Why do you care, Cameron? I mean, honestly.

38
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,740
别敷衍我  只是想问问
Stop handling me. It's just a question.

39
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,870
你为什么在乎答案呢
But why do you care about the answer?

40
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,560
你真是一张嘴就坏事
You are too screwed up for words.

41
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,450
就因为我不想在床上给你讲悲伤往事吗
Because I don't want to tell sad stories in bed with you?

42
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,640
-我们的关系怎么变成这样了  -什么"关系"
- When did this become that? - What's "This"?

43
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,840
我们的老规矩  你有需要的时候就过来
Our routine? You come over whenever, I don't know, you need to,

44
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,590
我也很愿意满足你
and I'm happy to oblige.

45
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,650
现在你却突然气我
Now all of a sudden you're getting pissed 

46
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,710
不肯跟你玩过家家
'cause I don't want to play house.

47
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,070
别犯浑  只是个问题
Don't do that. It's just a question.

48
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,880
规矩可是你定的
You designed the routine.

49
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,070
这招现在不好使了
Well, it's no longer doing anything for me.

50
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,260
变无聊了
This has gotten boring.

51
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,330
你想走随时可以走
You're free to leave whenever you like.

52
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,730
-你变无聊了  -我说过了
- You have gotten boring. - Like I said.

53
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,090
-你想要建议吗  乔  -不是很想  
- You want a piece of advice, Joe? - Not really.

54
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,320
你这一套  是挺吸引人的
Your whole thing, it attracts people,

55
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,060
但不足以留住他们
but it won't keep them around.

56
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,760
真诚才能鼓舞人心
Authenticity is what inspires people.

57
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,780
如果你想成为领袖
If you want to lead people,

58
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,200
就得让人们看到真实的你
you have to show them who you really are.

59
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,670
不然的话
Otherwise, 

60
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,390
你只是绣金花的枕头
you're just a thousand-dollar suit with nothing inside.

61
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,850
谁都不会在乎你
No one gives a shit.

62
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,670
几点了
What time is it? 

63
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,330
继续睡吧  很晚了
Go back to sleep. It's late.

64
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,460
你满身酒气
Mm, you smell like beer.

65
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,310
我好爱你
I love you so much.

66
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,420
戈登
Gordon.

67
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,430
你太美了
You're so beautiful.

68
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,790
别这样  我要睡觉
Stop it. I have to sleep.

69
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,260
我停不下来
I can't.

70
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,180
我明天还有很多事情  我得去拿蛋糕
I have so much tomorrow. I have to pick up the cake.

71
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,880
那家店6点就关门  我得上班前过去
And I have to do it before work 'cause they close at 6:00.

72
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,670
真可怜
You poor lady.

73
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,480
琼妮最近迷上了椰菜娃娃
And Joanie's become fixated on this Cabbage Patch Doll

74
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,190
还是椰菜仔什么的
or Kid or whatever.

75
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,510
一提起那个  她激动得都哭了
She got so worked up talking about it she started crying...

76
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,290
满脸狂热
tears of mania.

77
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:54,900
什么东西来着
What is it?

78
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,030
一个玩偶
It's a doll.

79
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,380
就是那种毛公仔
It's a stuffed baby.

80
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,620
我去买一个
I'll get it.

81
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,060
-什么  -我会去买的
- What? - I'm getting it.

82
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,610
戈登·克拉克来拯救你了
Gordon Clark to the rescue.

83
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,370
天哪  真的吗  那真是太棒了
Oh, my God, really? That would be amazing.

84
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,690
别操心了
Don't give it another thought.

85
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,400
快睡吧  小醉鬼
Oh, go to sleep, drunky.

86
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,360
给你个赠券  马上要下暴雨了
Rain check. Big storm's supposed to be coming in.

87
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:08,810
谢了
Thanks.

88
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,390
昨天晚上的演出怎么样
How was your show last night?

89
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,750
我的吉他着火了
My amp caught on fire.

90
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,750
估计是最精彩的部分了
Probably the best part.

91
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,580
我以为你会来的  你去哪了
I thought you'd be there. Where were you?

92
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,570
出去了
Out.

93
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,820
那是什么
What is that?

94
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,160
《巨洞冒险》的改进版本
Modified version of "Adventure."

95
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,090
我为你做的
I made it for you.

96
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,810
只是图个乐子而已
A stupid thing I did for fun.

97
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,740
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

98

"天才降临于世并非为他自己
"A gifted man bears his gifts into the world not for himself,

100
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,890
而是为了身边的人
but for the people among whom he is placed.

101
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,870
因为天赋并不为他所有
Because the gifts are not his.

102
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,360
他本人就是社会所得到的馈赠"
He himself is a gift to his community."

103
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,140
这话是亨利·福特说的  这话对他很受用
Henry Ford said that. Did pretty well for himself.

104
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,630
这房间里英才云集
There are many gifted men and women in this room,

105
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,650
而此时此刻
and this moment,

106
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,070
我们自己的创造诞生了
we bring our creation into the world.

107
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,720
今天按下这个按钮之后

我们产生的涟漪效应
we start a ripple effect

109
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,090
今后将惠及本产业的好几代人
that will be felt through our community for generations.

110
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,130
感谢我们的工程师  为我们制造了一台原型机

All right. Okay.

124
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,660
女士们先生们
Well, ladies and gentlemen...

125
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,490
有时候人总得
a time comes when...

126
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,370
有种冒冒险  是吧
well, you gotta grab your balls and jump, am I right?

127
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,510
{\pos(204,60)}世界  你好

128

-我们没事了吧  -嗯

133
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,750
这段时间  抱歉了
Sorry about how things have been.

134
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,300
这个过程有时候会让我很混蛋
This process doesn't always bring out my best.

135
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,740
我也一样
That's true of us both.

136
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,080
我们该庆祝一下
We should celebrate.

137
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,890
明晚来吃晚饭吧

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,840
这就成了
So, that's it.

143
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,970
外围驱动你团队写得怎么样了
When can we expect the peripheral drivers from your team?

144
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,430
你今后就打算这么和我说话了吗
Is this how you're gonna talk to me from now on?

145
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,440
那你要我怎么和你说话
How would you like me to talk to you?

146
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,840
像个人那样说话
Like you're flesh and blood.

147
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,580
你要觉得我太公事公办  那抱歉
I'm sorry if my tone is businesslike, 

148
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,480
但我的确是你上司
but I am your boss

149
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,870
而且这毕竟是工作
and this is, in fact, a business.

150
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,430
老天  真像活人啊
Oh, my God. So lifelike.

151
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,490
{\an7}{\pos(234,74)}你是卡梅伦·豪伊吗

152
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,570
{\an7}{\pos(164,54)}你是卡梅伦·豪伊吗

153
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,570
{\an7}{\pos(163,74)}是的

154
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,570
{\an7}{\pos(162,118)}恭喜  你是个应用程序快速开发编程员
这游戏是为你准备的  需要指示吗

155
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,140
{\an7}{\pos(290,150)}好

156
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:13,520
{\an7}{\pos(162,192)}你正站在IBM公司总部大厦里
据说有些人进来后就失踪了
你必须离开  你有一颗手榴弹

157
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,410
{\an7}{\pos(278,220)}扔出

158
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,770
{\an7}{\pos(140,190)}扔出手榴弹

159
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,640
戈登
Gordon.

160
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,010
我们的电脑要有性格
Our computer's gonna have a personality.

161
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,330
操作系统向用户提问  用户再回答
An operating system that asks you questions, you answer it back.

162
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,650
可以互动
You interact.

163
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,210
什么
What?

164
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,240
我需要再加384k内存
Um, I need an additional 384k of RAM.

165
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,110
不行
Um... no.

166
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,560
"不行"是什么意思
What do you mean, no?

167
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,250
我的意思是  绝对不行
I mean, it's completely out of the question.

168
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,980
操作系统像猪一样能吃
Operating systems are total pigs.

169
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,980
就算增加了内存
Even with the added memory,

170
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,300
也还是要跟其他应用抢...
you're gonna be stealing from the other applications...

171
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,780
-是啊  -整台电脑都会慢下来
- Yeah. - ...and slowing the entire machine down.

172
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,510
我知道  但是戈登  想想办法
I know, but, Gordon, figure out a way around that.

173
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,820
-卡梅隆  没得商量  -不...
- Cameron, it's done. - No, it's--

174
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,170
看看电脑吧  已经完成了
Look at it. It's done. 

175
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,320
不  还有完成  电脑...
No, it's not done. It's-- it's--

176
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,400
电脑运行良好  但它需要灵魂
it works fine, but it needs a soul.

177
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,390
要让人们能爱上我们的电脑
It needs to be something that people can fall in love with.

178
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,380
我们能做到
We can do that.

179
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,710
我干这行15年  如果说学会了什么
Okay, if there's one thing that I've learned in the 15 years of doing this

180
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,060
那就是  你迟早得停止改来改去
is that at some point, you have to stop changing things.

181
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,500
必须满足于制造出来的东西
You have to be happy with what you've made.

182
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,580
你害怕了
You're scared.

183
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,490
我有什么好怕的
What would I be scared of?

184
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,720
不如造一台能给我们打手枪的电脑吧
Yeah, why don't we make the machine jerk us off, too?

185
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,530
我还可以在操作系统中
And I can program hundreds of commands

186
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,220
编写几百道命令  识别言语的地域差异
in the operating system for it to understand

187
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,270
好让系统理解
accounting for regional variance in speech,

188
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,490
针对每个用户回复编写10种回应
program 10 ways for it to respond to each.

189
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,530
操作系统会很健谈的
It would be conversational.

190
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,210
就好像在与人类交谈
It would be like speaking to a human being.

191
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,940
-慢点说  -你玩过《巨洞冒险》
- Slow down. - You've played "Adventure."

192
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,760
就像那样  但不是"我想过河"
It's like that, except instead of, "I want to cross the stream,"

193
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,710
而是输入"我想运行字星"
you input "I want to run WordStar."

194
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,690
你告诉它想让它做什么
You tell it what you want it to do.

195
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,110
硬件需要做什么改动
What are the hardware implications?

196
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,560
你和戈登谈过了吗
Have you talked to Gordon about this?

197
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,370
戈登太胆小了
Gordon is too scared 

198
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,570
不敢尝试任何新的  不同寻常的东西
to try anything new or different

199
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,800
因为他一直失败  心里有阴影
because he's traumatized from being a loser his entire life.

200
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,260
我觉得这话有点夸张了
I think you might be overstating that slightly.

201
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,660
好吧
Okay.

202
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,250
看这个
See this?

203
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,360
这是小时候我和我爸一起做的
This I made with my dad when I was a little kid.

204
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,350
就是个破毛公仔
It's a stupid, stuffed thing,

205
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,170
但我爸操控它  还假装它说话
but my dad wiggled its head and he gave it a voice

206
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,000
这给了它生命
and he brought it to life.

207
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,710
我给它起了名字  爱上了它
I named it. I fell in love with it.

208
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,410
我们就是要创造这样的感情联系
This is the sort of loyalty we can create.

209
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,670
我们得先占有一定的市场份额
We have to get a share of the market first.

210
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,820
得先证明我们有能力和大对手竞争
We have to show that we can compete with the majors

211
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,920
然后才能继续改进
before we start changing things up.

212
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,050
也许第二代机器可以做这方面的尝试
Maybe for a second generation, we could do something like this.

213
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,180
是因为昨晚的事吗
This is because of last night.

214
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,050
我都没想那事
I haven't given that a second thought.

215
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,100
你不是说要公事公办吗
I thought you said this was a business.

216
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,930
没错  如果采取标准操作系统
It is. If we go with a standard operating system,

217
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,600
我告诉你将会如何
I know what is going to happen.

218
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,500
不会有什么意外或者困难
There are no surprises down that road, no pitfalls.

219
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,660
我们能进入计算机分销商展览
We will go to COMDEX,

220
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,770
摆上西尔斯的货架
we will make it into Sears,

221
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,490
至少能卖出十五万台
we will sell 150,000 units, guaranteed.

222
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,050
而你的提议保证不了任何一点
You're offering me none of that.

223
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,440
天哪  你说的没错
Gosh, you're right.

224
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,650
真不知道我怎么搞的
I don't know what's wrong with me.

225
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,650
大概听了你的那些漂亮话
I guess with all your grandstanding,

226
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,080
我真当你是个有远见的人呢
I somehow got you confused with a visionary.

227
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,780
原来你只是随便说说
I guess it just doesn't matter what you're saying

228
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,420
哗众取宠而已
as long as people are listening, right?

229
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,010
你这是什么意思
What the hell does that mean?

230
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,860
对不起
Forgive me.

231
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,980
我只是觉得总该有个人或物有点灵魂
I just thought something around here should have a soul.

232
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,250
恐怕你还得帮我梳理一遍
I may need you to walk me through this.

233
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,100
还是有些地方我不太懂
It's possible some of it's going over my head.

234
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,860
当然  没问题
Yeah, no problem.

235
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,710
你的话戈登都能听懂吗
Does Gordon understand everything that comes out of your mouth?

236
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,160
那必须是和电脑有关的
Yeah, as long as it's about computers.

237
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,490
他的项目进展如何
How's his project coming along?

238
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,190
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

239
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,350
他的绝密项目
His super secret project.

240
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,910
挺好的
It's going well.

241
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,400
占了他不少时间呢
It's eating up a lot of his time.

242
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,170
因为没有最快最小只有更快更小嘛
You know, it can always be faster, it can always be smaller.

243
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,840
他们已经解决了主板空间的问题
They solved the real estate problem, though.

244
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,760
你帮忙了吧
Did you help them with that?

245
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,830
或许吧
Maybe.

246
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,360
怎么解决的
What was the solve?

247
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,090
主板双面都装芯片
Chips on both sides of the board.

248
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,580
就这么简单
So simple.

249
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,790
看来你不光是我一个人的秘密武器啊
I guess you're everyone's secret weapon, huh?

250
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,470
绝密武器
Super secret.

251
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,650
说到这个
Speaking of,

252
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,380
公司那边需要人去介绍一下工作
corporate's gonna want a presentation of this work.

253
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,260
我需要你帮忙
I'm gonna need you by my side.

254
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,660
你能来吗
Would you be up for that?

255
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,610
出趟差
A little business trip?

256
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,160
当然能
Of course.

257
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,200
太好了
Good.

258
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,910
嗯  太好了
Yes, good.

259
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,750
卡梅伦跟你说了她关于操作系统的金点子了吗
Cameron tell you her bright idea about the operating system?

260
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,450
简直疯了  是吧
It's insane, right?

261
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,410
你肯定拒绝她了吧
I trust that you told her no.

262
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,170
你跟她说了不予考虑了吧
Tell me you told her it was out of the question.

263
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,240
我不知道  这也许是个好主意
I don't know. She might be onto something.

264
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,190
-这点子很独特  -独特
- It's certainly unique. - "Unique"?

265
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,280
三个月前你可没在白板上写"独特"这俩字
You didn't write "Unique" On the board three months ago.

266
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,520
-没准该写上  -你写的是更快  更便宜
- Maybe I should have. - You wrote "Faster," You wrote "Cheaper."

267
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,800
而且重点不在这儿
Anyway, that's not the point.

268
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,940
你知道这要占用多少主板空间吗
Do you know how much real estate that would take?

269
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,490
我得重新规划整个主板的布局
I'd have to rethink the entire layout of the board.

270
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,360
伟大就得付出代价  对吧
Greatness comes at a price, no?

271
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,560
没错  代价我已经付了
Yeah, and I've paid that price.

272
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,020
你知道我有多少个晚上没哄女儿睡觉了吗
Do you know how many nights I've missed putting my kids to bed?

273
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,110
你知道我在这儿熬了多少个通宵吗
You know how many all-nighters I've spent here?

274
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,590
你对我提出了要求  我也做到了
You asked me to do something and I did it.

275
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,890
本来是不可能的事  我也做到了
It was impossible and I did it anyway.

276
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,550
这只是个思想实验  我还在考虑
It's a thought experiment. And I'm considering it.

277
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,780
别  别去考虑
Well, don't. Just don't consider it.

278
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,970
我想考虑什么就考虑什么
I'm gonna do whatever I want to do

279
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,350
我让你做什么你就做什么
and you're gonna do whatever I tell you to do

280
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,900
你我之间的关系就是这样的
because that's the way this relationship works.

281
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,940
然后乔告诉我他真的在考虑
And Joe tells me he's actually considering it.

282
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,290
你不能再改了  现在已经很完美了
You can't change it. It's a thing of beauty.

283
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,420
我不清楚  没准他说得对呢
I don't know. Maybe he's right.

284
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,980
不  戈登  你的电脑很完美
No, Gordon, you built a beautiful machine.

285
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,120
你得维护自己的作品
You have to stand up for it.

286
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,540
乔·麦克米伦就是一混蛋
Joe MacMillan's an asshole.

287
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,090
他对你的工作毫不了解
He doesn't know a fraction of what you do

288
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,920
根本不知道什么叫好电脑
about what makes a good computer.

289
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,520
老爸  飓风要来了吗
Daddy, is the hurricane gonna come?

290
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,130
不会  这边可能会刮大风  下点雨
No, no, no, no. We might get a big storm, some rain,

291
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,940
但是飓风到不了这儿的
but the hurricane can't reach us here.

292
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,160
休斯顿大概会被吹惨了  但是
Houston might get walloped, but--

293
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,760
咱这儿很安全  去玩吧
We're safe here. You guys go play.

294
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:33,060
你买了那个什么了吗
Oh, hey, did you get the you-know-what?

295
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,560
-什么  -那个椰菜...
- What's that? - The Cabbage...

296
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,270
什么椰菜
Did I get cabbage?

297
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,290
不是  是那个
No, the--

298
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,340
椰菜娃娃
the Cabbage Patch Kid.

299
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,730
啊买了  我放在办公室了
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I left it at the office.

300
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,120
我不想让琼妮找到  她老是到处乱翻
I didn't want Joanie to find it. She snoops, you know?

301
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,050
对了  最糟糕的是
Anyway, sort of the worst part of it is--

302
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,460
你要记住  你是爱我的
please keep in mind that you love me when I tell you this,

303
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,140
在我俩吵架之前
but before everything went down,

304
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,770
我请乔来吃晚饭了
I invited Joe for dinner tomorrow.

305
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,910
-来家里吗  -我当时觉得这主意挺好
- Dinner here? - I know, it felt like the right thing to do.

306
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,620
能让我俩更和睦点
You know? Smooth things over.

307
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,020
那你觉得这个想法
Well, do you think this idea

308
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,120
真会毁了你的成果吗
could really compromise what you've done?

309
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,620
会
Yeah.

310
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,130
那你得尽全力改变他的想法
Well, you have to do whatever you can to change his mind.

311
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,540
哪怕得请他来吃饭
Even if that means inviting him into our home.

312
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,290
这是你的机器  戈登  别让他毁了
It's your machine, Gordon. Don't let him ruin it.

313
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,450
嗯
Yeah.

314
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,780
怎么了这是
So, what's going on in there?

315
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,380
出什么问题了
Is something wrong?

316
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,150
我卡壳了
I'm stuck.

317
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,080
进来吧
Come in.

318
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,190
要搭车吗
Hey, you need a ride to work?

319
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,160
不用  我得写完
Uh, no, I'm on a roll.

320
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,540
怎么了
What?

321
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,780
你测试驱动了吗
Hey, did you start the tests on those drivers?

322
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,410
没  程序员还没给我
No, I'm waiting for the coders to give them to me.

323
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,170
-莱夫  -我知道  莱夫
- Lev. - Yeah, I know. Lev.

324
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,100
我想问驱动什么时候能完成
Listen, I was wondering when we were gonna get some of the drivers.

325
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,320
得尽快进行端到端测试
We need to start end-to-end testing as soon as possible.

326
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,540
我在写操作系统扩展
I'm working on the OS expansion.

327
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,530
什么  谁让你干这个的
What? Who told you to work on that?

328
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,590
卡梅伦
Cameron did.

329
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,470
乔也同意了吗
Did Joe approve that?

330
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,520
你接着写驱动
Go back to working on the driver, okay?

331
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,380
老大是我  不是卡梅伦
I'm the boss, not Cameron.

332
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,320
卡梅伦负责软件部分
Well, Cameron's in charge of software.

333
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,150
我负责不让别人干傻事
Well, I'm in charge of stopping idiotic things from happening.

334
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,220
你可以相信我
And you can trust me. 

335
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,920
我不是靠睡产品经理得逞的
I'm not screwing the product manager to get my way.

336
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,670
什么
What?

337
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,170
莱夫  接着写驱动  好吗
Lev, just go back to working on the driver, okay?

338
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,760
我来解决
I'll straighten this out.

339
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,660
戈登  你妻子来电话
Gordon, your wife called.

340
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,420
她要我提醒你那个
She wanted me to remind you about the...

341
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,420
椰菜娃娃
The Cabbage Patch.

342
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,800
附近有玩具店吗
Do you know of a toy store nearby?

343
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,270
帮我找一找呗  黛比
Well, can you find one, Debbie?

344
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,860
-好的  -太好了
- Yes. - That'd be great.

345

346
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,730
{\pos(220,80)}椰菜娃娃售罄

347
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,460

348
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,420
-该死的  -哥们  你好啊
- Son of a bitch. - Hey, pal. Hey there.

349
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,340
你不会是想买椰菜娃娃吧
You ain't looking for a Cabbage Patch by any chance?

350
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,600
-没错  -我有一个
- Yeah. Yeah, I am. - I got one.

351
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,840
这些混蛋高价卖我80块
I paid 80 bucks for it 'cause these jerks marked it up

352
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,020
就因为是最后一个
 'cause it was the last one.

353
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,450
现在他们又不让我退
And now they won't let me return it.

354
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,130
-我买了  -真的吗
- I'll take it. - Honestly?

355
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,300
-真的  -你真是我的救世主
- Yeah, yeah. - Oh, you're a lifesaver.

356
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,560
-我买了  -谢谢  就在这儿
- Yeah, yeah. - Thank you. It's right here.

357
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,980
你可帮了我大忙
You are really saving my butt.

358
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,930
彼此彼此  相信我
Likewise, believe me.

359
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,700
现在我能回家求我老婆上床了
All right, well, now I might go home and beg the wife for sex.

360
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,300
或许还能成功呢
Probably get some, too.

361
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,440
祝你好运
Well, good luck.

362
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,050

No!

364
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,720
模块弄得怎么样了
Hey, where are you with that module?

365
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,480
-你逗我呢  -怎么了
- Are you kidding me? - What?

366
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,980
戈登让我们所有人去写驱动
Gordon retasked us all with drivers.

367
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,560
你们总改变指示  烦死了
You keep changing directions on us. This sucks.

368
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,110
想好到底要我们做什么  我们会照做的  天呐
Just figure out what you want us to do and we'll do it, Jesus.

369
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,240
把所有程序员叫到我办公室来
Get all the coders in my office.

370
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,180
马上
Now.

371
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,980
我不知道别人跟你们说了什么
I don't know what anyone else has told you,

372
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,850
但我是你们的经理  你们听我的指示  好吗
but I'm your manager. You take instructions from me, okay?

373
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,060
别人也都这么说
That's what everyone else is saying.

374
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,500
他们错了  好吗
Well, they're wrong, okay?

375
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,050
今天就把操作系统的模块做出来
I need that module for the OS and I need it today.

376
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,090
还有问题吗
Any questions?

377
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,860
我有个问题  你在上乔·麦克米伦吗
I got a question. Are you banging Joe MacMillan?

378
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,300
我傻到以为一个玩具店
Oh, yeah, I'm stupid for thinking a toy store

379
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,490
会卖世界上最流行的玩具
might carry the world's most popular toy.

380
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,400
喂

我要找一个椰菜娃娃
Uh, yes, I'm looking for a Cabbage Patch Kid.

384
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,600

You do?

385
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,540
真的吗
Uh, really?

386
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,070
你能先留住它吗
C-can you put it on hold?

387
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,110
我现在就去
No, I will come right now.

388
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,850
别卖掉那个椰菜娃娃
Look, do not sell that Cabbage Patch.

389
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,740
喂
Hello?

390
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,490

00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,390
你昨晚太销魂了
You were incredible last night.

392
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,500
我绝不会跟她上床的  好吗
I-- I would never, okay?

393
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,210
你们见过唐娜的  对吧
Y-y-you guys know Donna, right?

394
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:50,190
乔  很高兴这么大雨你还能来赴约
Joe, glad you could make it in this downpour.

395
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,570
快请进  戈登还没回来
Oh, come in. Gordon's not back yet, but 

396
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,000
但他应该马上就到了
he should be here soon.

397
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,390
66年的波尔多葡萄酒  值得一品
Uh, '66 Bordeaux. Really interesting.

398
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,730
谢谢  你真周到
Thank you. How thoughtful.

399
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,130
你认识琼妮和海莉吧
You know Joanie and Haley, right?

400
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,550
姑娘们  打招呼  这是乔  爸爸的同事
Girls, say hi. This is Joe, Daddy's work friend.

401
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,270
-乔  你好  -晚上好
- Hi, Joe. - Evening.

402
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,430
工作怎么样
So, how's everything going at work?

403
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:17,640
戈登跟我说一切进展顺利
Gordon tells me things are progressing nicely.

404
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,070
嗯  挺顺利的
Yeah, moving right along.

405
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,780
你坐的那只鞋可是从意大利来的呢
That shoe you're sitting on comes all the way from Italy.

406
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,820
那是哪里
Where's that?

407
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,500
很远的地方
Far away from here.

408
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,570
戈登应该就快回来了
Gordon should be back any minute.

409
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,470
我是不是都说过了
Did I say that already?

410
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:57,230
今晚  加尔维斯顿又将遭遇强飓风
Galveston is once again braced for a major hurricane tonight.

411
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,230
风速超过时速110英里
Winds exceeding 110 miles per hour...

412
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,520
-你去哪  -回家
- Where are you going? - Home.

413
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,270
得了  外面雨那么大
Oh, come on. It's pissing rain out there.

414
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,730
来跟我喝杯酒
Come have a drink with me.

415
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,770
来吧  我给你调卡迪夫特色酒
Come on, I'll make you a Cardiff Special.

416
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,910
我不接受拒绝
I'm not taking no for an answer.

417
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,000
赶快点  丫头
Come on, shake it, kid.

418
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,570
一切还好吧
Hope everything's all right.

419
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,240
没事的  就我对我丈夫的了解
No, everything's fine. If I know my husband,

420
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,320
他正在外面疯子似的到处跑
he's out right now running around frantically,

421
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,430
找椰菜娃娃呢
trying to find a Cabbage Patch Kid.

422
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,810
姑娘们  别去折腾他了
Oh, girls, would you leave him alone, please?

423
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:47,290
-你多大了  -35  怎么了
- How old are you? - I'm 35, why?

424
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,250
不知道  我六岁
I don't know. I'm six.

425
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,880
行了  你们想搭城堡吗
Hey, okay, okay. What about a fort?

426
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,680
-好  -要搭城堡吗
- Okay. - Would you like to build a fort?

427
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,960
好嘞
All right, uh...

428
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,440
你们知道哪有毯子吗
Do you girls know if we can find any blankets?

429
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,360
-好  -把那把椅子转过来
- Okay. - Okay, let's turn that chair around.

430
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,310
好
Okay. 

431
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,380
好嘞
Here we go.

432
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,690
行了  都进去
All right, everyone in.

433
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,420
来  都进来  都进来
Come on, everyone in. Everyone in.

434
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,320
戈登跟我说你打算
So, Gordon tells me you're thinking of 

435
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,960
对操作系统进行试验性的改进
doing something experimental with the OS?

436
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,680
我在考虑
I'm considering it.

437
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,050
事实上  我就是想做件大事
The truth is, I just want to do something great.

438
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,990
那么折磨卡梅伦算什么
How did torturing Cameron fit into that?

439
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,620
那事我很后悔
I regret that...

440
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,790
但我是为了让世人注意我们
but it was about getting the world's attention.

441
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,690
我还想成功
I guess I also want to do something successful.

442
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,520
那你就该听戈登的
Well, then you should listen to Gordon.

443
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,530
他真的很天才
He's actually a genius.

444
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,320
要不我干吗选他啊
Why do you think I chose him?

445
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,120
你了解对手
You know the competition.

446
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,850
想要挤进他们的市场
The only way to cut into their market share is 

447
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,070
就得质量比他们好或价格比他们低  或都做到
by doing what they do better or cheaper or both,

448
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,360
这你是能做到的  只要你不再做改动
and you can do that if you stick with what you've got.

449
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,240
独创性也很重要  不是吗
There's something to be said for ingenuity, no?

450
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,180
当然了  我就是这意思
Well, sure. Exactly. That's what I'm saying. 

451
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,100
你们的机器很有独创性
There's ingenuity in there.

452
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,810
这台机器你都看了几个月了
You've been sitting with this machine for a few months now.

453
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,690
有时候人会看不出
It's easy to lose sight of what's great

454
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,220
眼前的东西有多伟大  因为太习惯成自然
when it's right in front of you. You get used to it.

455
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,970
你们造的电脑简直是艺术品
The computer you two built is a work of art,

456
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,180
不止如此  还能热卖
and not only that, it'll sell.

457
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,560
你可以相信你最初的设想
So you can believe in your original vision.

458
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,720
你促成了这一切
You made it all happen.

459
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,080
老天爷啊
Whew, God Alfrighty.

460
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:42,090
天呐  下得真大
Jeez, it's coming down now.

461
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,930
下午在大办公室闹的那是哪一出
What was that dustup in the bullpen this afternoon?

462
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,090
说来话长
It's a long story.

463
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,090
我有的是时间
Yeah, well, I got nothing but time.

464
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,290
克拉克啊
Clark, huh?

465
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,340
戈登挺好的
Gordon is good.

466
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,300
他真的很好
He's really good.

467
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,880
但戈登想建的电脑
But Gordon wants to build a computer

468
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,950
是一台让电脑行业赞叹的电脑
that'll impress all the other people who build computers.

469
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,750
而我想建一台让普通人
I want to build something for people who 

470
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,400
那些从未想过自己想要电脑的人
never thought they'd want a computer,

471
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,010
对电脑毫不了解的人喜欢的电脑
who don't know anything about them.

472
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,350
我想为你这样的人建一台电脑
I want to build a computer for you.

473
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,420
喂喂  我还是了解电脑的
Hey, now. I know my way around a damn computer.

474
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,110
你还垫尿布的时候我就入行了  丫头
I've been in this business since before you were in diapers, kid.

475
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,540
行啦  你懂我的意思
All right. You know what I mean.

476
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,460
我想建一台能让人爱上的电脑
I want to build something that makes people fall in love.

477
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,800
你怎么爱上电脑的
How'd you fall in love?

478
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,650
电脑俱乐部
Computer Club.

479
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,790
我初中的时候朋友不多
I didn't have a ton of friends in junior high.

480
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,550
令人震惊
Oh, I am shocked by that.

481
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,570
嗯
Yeah.

482
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:59,530
有一天午餐的时候  我躲在一间教室里
So, yeah, I was hiding out in a classroom at lunch

483
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,480
然后电脑俱乐部进来了
and the Computer Club came in.

484
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,100
我就装作我本来就该在那儿
I just pretended I was there on purpose.

485
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:09,410
门罗老师教我们BASIC语言
Mr. Monroe taught us BASIC and 

486
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,290
那感觉简直犹如沙漠中找到甘泉
it was like finding water in the middle of the desert.

487
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:18,040
我第一次知道要如何交流
For the first time, I knew how to talk to something.

488
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,310
我终于掌握合适的语言了
I finally had the right language.

489
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,920
我们这不聊得挺好
You're talking just fine now.

490
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,910
我喝醉了嘛
I'm drunk.

491
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,420
听我说
Listen, now, the--

492
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,690
今天的那出闹剧
the theatrics out there today.

493
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,460
你要小心点  卡梅
Be more careful, Cam.

494
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:47,150
我不小了  我能照顾好自己
I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself.

495
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,530
我知道  这还用说吗  但是...
Oh, hell, I know that. That's plain as day. It's just...

496
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,290
这里的一些人
Some of the people around here,

497
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,630
不管他们怎么说  甚至怎么想
no matter what they say, or even what they think--

498
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,550
他们始终有点希望你搞砸
part of them wants to see you shit the bed on this thing.

499
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:02,970
为什么
Why's that?

500
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,310
因为你是未来
'Cause you're the future.

501
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,020
没什么比这更让人害怕的了
Ain't nothing scarier than that.

502
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,890
我小时候  大暴风雨来袭时
When I was little, any time there was a big storm,

503
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,600
我爸会带我们出去
my dad would take us out in it

504
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,150
让我知道这没什么好怕的
to show me there was nothing to be afraid of.

505
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:20,430
之后一个邻居的孩子被倒下的树压在了下面
Then a kid in our neighborhood got pinned under a fallen tree

506
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,430
他就不再那么做了
and so he stopped doing that.

507
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,950
那时候做父母好不一样啊
I feel like parenting used to be different.

508
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,050
我妈以前会带我登上
My mom used to take me up to the 

509
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,940
我们家的屋顶看星星
roof of our old Victorian to look at the stars.

510
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,370
我们居然能活到今天真是奇迹
That any of us survived is a miracle.

511
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,380
好了  没事的
Hey, hey, it's okay.

512
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,340
你们怕飓风吗
You afraid of the hurricane?

513
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,940
但你们有飓风控制器啊
But you've got hurricane zappers right here.

514
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,250
你们不知道这是什么吗  就这个啊
You don't know about hurricane zappers? Oh, yeah, these.

515
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,010
把这个指向风暴  它就伤不到你了
Just point them at the storm and it can't hurt you.

516
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,530
真的  试试吧
Here, I'm telling you the truth. Give it a shot. 

517
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,280
在屋里照就行吗
It'll work through the roof?

518
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,960
嗯  大点的飓风你就得去屋外了
Oh, yeah. A bigger storm, you might need to go outside.

519
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,970
不过这种小风暴  在屋里就行
But a little storm like this, through the roof should be fine.

520
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,800
-去试试吧  -瞧他们
- Let's try it. - There they go.

521
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:41,690
{\pos(193,20)}椰菜娃娃

522
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:44,990
不行啊
It's not working.

523
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,340
我试试行吗
Mind if I give it a shot?

524
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,180
风暴太大了  你得出去
It's a big storm. You have to do it outside.

525
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,050
-不  亲爱的  -大概让你说中了
- No, sweetheart... - You're probably right.

526
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,570
大概真是这样
You're probably right.

527
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,640
-乔  你不用的...  -行了  跟我来
- Joe, you don't have to... - Okay, follow me.

528
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,000
真的
You really don't have to.

529
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,260
-小心  别伤到她  -她
- Be careful, don't let her get hurt. - Her?

530
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:03,410
-安娜塔西亚  -你给它起名了
- Anastasia. - You named it.

531
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:04,940
我的叫莎尔姬
Mine is Sharky.

532
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,070
她们是你的朋友吗
And they're your friends?

533
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,150
我一定小心
I promise to be very careful.

534
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,840
看着
Okay, watch.

535
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,430
-他干什么呢  -我们去看看吧
- What's he doing? - Let's go see.

536
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,650
在外面效果好多了
It works a lot better outside.

537
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,900
好了  好了
OK. All right, all right.

538
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,300
-给你  -谢谢
- Here you go. - Oh, thanks.

539
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,590
-戈登  -爸爸
- Gordon! - Daddy!

540
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,450
我们担心死你了  你没事吧
We were worried about you. Are you all right?

541
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:16,420
嗯  没事  抱歉我这么晚才回来
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm so sorry I'm so late.

542
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,810
你怎么了
What happened to you?

543
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,330
谢谢你留到现在  乔  多谢了
Oh, thanks for sticking around, Joe. I appreciate it.

544
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,400
没事
It's no problem.

545
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,660
我们吃吧  你们吃了吗
Should we eat? Did you guys eat?

546
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,010
我还是走吧  不打扰你们了

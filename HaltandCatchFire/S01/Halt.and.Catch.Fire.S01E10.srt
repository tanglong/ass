Gordon, can we go to bed now?

13

天啊  这是怎么回事
Sheesh, what happened here?

14
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,620
不知道  也许掉下来了吧
I don't know. Maybe it fell?

15
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,230
从房间一头飞到另一头吗
Across the room?

16
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,780
也许响得太频繁了吧
Maybe it was ringing too much.

17
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,490
-那个又是怎么回事  -灾难性故障

Looks like it, don't it?

20

Okay, so just leave them on the desk when you're done.

既然我可以卖个五百万
Why would I want $40 million

36
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,240

在朗维尤制造短波收音机起家

我听说他亲自管理工厂
I heard he ran the factory floor himself.

49

这不是为了钱
I'm not talking about money.

50

公司完全转向经营个人电脑

更加适合21世纪

你俩一起管
You both run it.

56

平起平坐
As equals...

57
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,690
因为你是一条响尾蛇
because you are a rattlesnake,

58
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,770
而你是一只小白兔
and you-- you're a little bunny rabbit,

59
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,040
但你是研发计算机的技术人员
but you're the brains behind this thing.

60
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,400
好
Fine.

61
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,130
我俩各持公司8%的股份
Eight percent of the company,

62
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,280
全面摊薄
fully diluted,

63
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,570
1年后开始兑现股份  期满4年全部兑现
four-year vesting, cliff at one year for each of us.

64
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,230
我就该把你杀了埋了
You know, I should just bury you in a shallow grave.

65
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,490
找别人来管理这个公司
I should get somebody else in here to run this company.

66
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,540
或者自己管理  还能省笔钱
Hell, I should save a few bucks and just run it myself.

67
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,780
那祝你好运了
Good luck with that.

68
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,190
你准备把工厂建在本地  还是省点钱建在台湾
You gonna manufacture locally or in Taiwan to save some coin?

69
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,920
日本的出口设施更好
Japan has better output facilities,

70
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,300
但是关税太高了
but the tariffs are tricky.

71
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,180
要是你知道该找谁
You might be able to do a deal

72
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,230
或许可以跟英特尔谈下批发的合同
with Intel in bulk if you know who to talk to,

73
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,380
不过他还同时管理IBM的批发业务
but it's the same guy who manages IBM's bulk deal,

74
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,470
所以得下点功夫
so it'll take some massaging.

75
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,920
不久就要改用286  转投AMD
Go 286 in the near future and switch to AMD.

76
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,130
绕过英特尔
Bypass Intel. 

77
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,910
而且AMD的产品一般运行更快
Especially since AMD parts almost always clock faster.

78
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,970
兆赫配置  低价买入
Megahertz, minimum bucks.

- Eight percent. - Each.

81

你们平分
Split.

82
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,320

We can live with that.

我需要所有人都来调试这些机子
so I need all hands on deck QA-ing these boxes.

如果是工艺问题  我可以打电话问

什么意思
What do you mean you don't know yet?

那我们手里有个劣品
Then we got a bad egg. 

215
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,890
目前为止五台机器出一台劣品
One bad egg out of the five we've touched so far.

Say one in five computers has the flaw? That's 20,000 units.

会影响出货吗
Oh, will it delay shipment?

223
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,160
我们得检查每一台样机
Well, we'll have to check every test unit.

224
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,260
或许这是个机遇
Maybe this is an opportunity.

225
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,640
我们延迟一两个月上架  修复漏洞
Maybe we delay a month or two to fix the bug

别计较机票钱和派对费用了
This is bigger than plane fares and party costs.

231
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,440
我们在查补漏洞时
We got software just sitting around

232
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,730
软件工程师都在无所事事
while we figure out what's wrong.

233
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,110
我去让他们设计一个杀手应用
Let me run with them and build a killer app.

234
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,240
等到漏洞成功修复
By the time the bug is fixed,

235
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,980
我们在电脑天地上架的就不光是台电脑了
ComputerLand won't just have a computer,

236
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,730
而是一组套装
they'll have a bundled suite.

237
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,020
对我们又是优势了
We'll be out ahead again.

238
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,960
是喜事一桩吧
Now that's something to celebrate.

239
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,270
我知道这很遗憾
Look, I know this is unfortunate.

240
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,800
但人生就是要变劣势为优势  对吧
But life gives you lemons, right?

241
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,130
听好
Okay, listen up.

242
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,530
出货要延期
We've had a little hiccup with shipping,

243
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,990
所以我们多了些额外的时间
which means we've got some extra time,

244
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,020
作为软件工程师
and because we're who we are,

245
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,290
我们不能浪费时间玩游戏  发呆
we're not gonna spend it playing "Pong" and twiddling our thumbs.

246
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,920
我们得好好利用
We're gonna capitalize.

247
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,130
我知道你们一直摩拳擦掌想写些
I know you've been chomping at the bit to write something

248
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,960
外围驱动软件之外的东西
that's not a peripheral driver.

00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,410
然后付诸实践
And then I want us to make them.

256
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,390
你们愿意接受挑战吗
You guys up for a challenge like that?

257
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,670

You bet.

Good, good, good.

259
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,500
第一天不上班怎么样啊
Hey, how was your first day off?

260
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,420

It was euphoric.

261
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,170

Where are the girls?

Do you wanna have one of our own?

264
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,230
有多糟
So, how bad is it?

265
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,970
出货肯定得推迟了
It's definitely gonna delay shipping.

266

我觉得是乔干的
I think Joe did it on purpose.

267
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,330
这对他有什么好处
I-I don't understand the benefit.

268
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,740
他根本不现实
He can't live in reality.

269
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,350
他总是在追逐空想
He's always chasing some fantasy, you know?

270
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,780
他从不知满足
He's never satisfied.

271
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,690
我不知道他的最终目的是什么
I don't know what his endgame is.

272
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,620
那不重要
It doesn't matter.

273
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,960
事实是我无法信任他
The truth is that I can't trust him.

274
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,550
你那么努力
Hey, you have worked too hard

275
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,200
冒了那么大的风险才走到今天  还有我
and risked too much to get here. We both have.

276
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,480
不能允许任何人搞破坏
Nothing can be allowed to jeopardize that.

277
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,770
你什么意思
What are you saying?

278
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,330
我想你懂我的意思
I think you know what I'm saying.

279
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,460
我找了三个小队检测3B5
I've got three teams running diagnostics on the 3B5,

280
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,990
看你是不是破坏了它
checking to see if you've corrupted it in any way.

281
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,260
还有人在检查网络本身是否受损
Also got guys checking the network itself to see if it's damaged.

282
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,220
伊莱  你不会这么笨吧
Come on, Eli. You're not that dumb.

283
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,190
你该知道网速其实可以快很多吧
You know the network can transmit way faster than we're letting it.

284
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,040
我们可以相移  调幅  插入纠错 
We can phase shift, modulate amplitude, insert error correction --

285
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,730
基本上我们想做什么都行
basically whatever we want.

286
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,400
你们的调制解调器没经过认证
Your modems were uncertified.

287
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,500
网络访问条款是我们控制的  你懂吗
We dictate the terms of how the network is accessed. You understand?

288
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,960
让我猜猜
So, let me guess.

289
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,520
南部电信也要建立自己的数据网络啦
Southern Lines is setting up its own data network?

290
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,090
你到底在为谁工作
Who do you really work for?

291
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,260
没谁  现在没了
Nobody. Not anymore.

292
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,370
{\an8}唐娜  工作物品

293
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,930
都有什么想法
All right, what do we got?

294
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,960
来吧  我们好好讨论一下
Come on, let's fire it up.

295
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,010
你  说说你的想法
You, let's hear it.

296
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,870
一个月相日历
It's a moon phase calendar.

297
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,340
只要你输入日期  它就能给出
So you type in the date and it gives you the upcoming 

298
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,370
之后25年里的月相
phases of the moon for the next 25 years.

299
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,820
比如  我生于1997年
So, like, on my birthday in 1997,

300
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,520
那就是个盈凸月
it's going to be a waxing gibbous.

301
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,740
好吧  还有吗
Okay. What else?

302
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,020
你来
You.

303
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,540
准备好  因为你一定会爱上它
Careful, you're gonna love this.

304
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,930
仿真软件  养蜂人
A simulator -- beekeeping.

305
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,000
全仿真模式
Full-on "Zimulation." hardcore.

306
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,350
一开始有三个蜂巢  然后你可以...
You start with three hives and you're able --

307
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,890
各位  杀手应用应该让人爱不释手
Guys, a killer app is something that everyone wants,

308
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,220
无法自拔
they must have.

309
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,340
构想要宏伟
Think bigger.

310
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:01,810
难道卡梅伦是这儿惟一真正有创意的人吗
What, so Cameron was the only one of you that had any real ideas?

311
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,740
那你又有什么创意  哥们
Well, what are your ideas, man?

312
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,140
唐娜
Donna...

313
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,880
我知道怎么做了
I know how I'm gonna do it.

314
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,370
说来听听
Lay it on me.

315
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,980
乔的弱点是什么
What is Joe's Achilles' heel?

316
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,590
休闲装
Casual wear.

317
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,590
不  是卡梅伦
No, Cameron.

318
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,430
他爱上了她  你知道吗
He's in love with her, you know?

319
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,860
我当然知道  你居然才知道吗
Of course I know that. What planet have you been on?

320
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,320
我要去向联调局告发她
I'm gonna turn her in to the feds

321
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,550
和博斯沃思一起入侵电脑
for hacking with Bosworth

322
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,250
除非乔离开卡迪夫
unless Joe leaves Cardiff.

323
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,740
这是不是太邪恶了点
Isn't that a little bit evil?

324
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,130
就为了摆脱乔你就要毁掉卡梅伦的一生吗
You're gonna ruin Cameron's entire life just to get rid of Joe?

325
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,040
放心  我又不会真去
Relax. I'm not actually gonna do it.

326
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,830
只是用来吓唬他的
I'm just gonna threaten to.

327
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,050
乔不会上当的
Joe's too smart for that.

328
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,770
如果被他看出你只是虚张声势
What happens when he calls your bluff

329
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,380
并没有胆量真去告发怎么办
and realizes you don't have the stomach to go through with it?

330
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,050
-不不不  -等等  除非
- No, no, no, no. - Wait, wait, unless...

331
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,430
你拿出证据
you show him proof.

332
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,220
比如银行守护程序的上传记录
Like this uplink from the bank's daemon.

333
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,530
这里显示交易代码的更改
It shows the alteration of transaction codes

334
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,170
能追踪到卡梅伦办公室的电脑上
all routed back to Cameron's office computer.

335
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,920
唐娜  这是打印驱动程序
Donna, this is a print driver.

336
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,190
乔又不知道
Joe doesn't know that.

337
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,220
没你我做不来
I can't do this without you.

338
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,330
做什么  乔
Do what, Joe?

339
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,320
卡梅伦
Cameron...

340
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,370
回卡迪夫吧
come back to Cardiff.

341
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,980
你想做什么都行
You can do whatever you want.

342
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,560
给你全权委托...
You'll have carte blanche--

343
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,810
-不行  -那好  别给卡迪夫干
- No. - Fine, don't work for Cardiff.

344
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,990
自己办公司  我找你做分包
Form your own company. I'll hire you as a vendor.

345
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,620
你可以不用见我  我...我需要你
You'll never have to see my face. I just-- I need you.

346
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,510
天哪  你真可悲
Oh, God, you're pathetic.

347
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,730
我们自己办公司
We can start our own company.

348
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,250
我离开卡迪夫
I'll leave Cardiff.

349
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,470
我们可以去加州  去哪都行
We can go to California, go anywhere.

350
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,570
白手起家
We can start from scratch.

351
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,070
我想和你在一起
I wanna be with you.

352
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,670
听着不错
That sounds nice.

353
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,460
我们合作造点什么东西
We could build something together, a partnership.

354
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,810
开创自己的未来
Make our own future.

355
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,680
不过你不是未来
Except you're not the future.

356
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,820
你只是个陪衬
You're a footnote.

357
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,880
之前你还真唬住我了
For a while, you had me fooled.

358
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,390
我还以为我对你动心了
I mean, I thought I heard a heartbeat.

359
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,960
但不是的
But it wasn't a heartbeat.

360
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,990
那只是回声
It was an echo.

361
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,010
我之前爱你...
I loved you...

362
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,940
是因为你把我的想法复述给我
because you recited my own ideas back to me

363
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,040
还假装那是你的
and pretended they were your own.

364
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,990
你想知道真相吗
You want to know the truth?

365
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,620
你还是你妈妈
You're still exactly what you were

366
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,320
让你掉下屋顶那天的那个人
the day your mom let you fall off that roof.

367
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,940
没错
Yeah.

368
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,620
一个可怜的小男孩
Just a sad little boy...

369
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,240
大有潜力  却毫无作为
with a lot of wasted potential.

370
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,020
你去哪了
Where the hell have you been?

371
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,640
11点半多了  你终于来了
It's past 11:30. Nice of you to show up.

372
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,820
过来  看看这个
Come here, you're gonna want to see this.

373
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,490
他们今天都没来上班
None of them showed up for work today.

374
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,370
去哪了呢
Where are they?

375
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,730
尼尔  告诉他
Neil, tell 'em.

376
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,380
他们跳槽去穆特尼了
They all went to work for Mutiny.

377
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,380
{\pos(267,276}意为反叛

378
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,920
没听说过
I've never heard of it.

379
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,790
这才是最有意思的
Well, that's the best part.

380
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,790
{\an8}欢迎来到穆特尼

381
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,390
好了  你们两个去买X射线管
Okay, I need you guys to buy as many XTs

382
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,550
摆在架子上  一直到放不下
for the shelves as you can until these max out.

383
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,320
好吧  可是调制解调器固件老出毛病
Okay, okay, but the modem firmware is bugging out all over the place.

384
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,680
-我没法预计故障  -好吧
- I can't predict the errors. - Okay--

385
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,860
还得着手写协议  界面  游戏
We need to get onto the protocols, the interface, the games.

386
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,390
-好  -最好找个人专门负责硬件
- Okay. - It'd be awesome to have someone dedicated to hardware.

387
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,190
该死
Shit.

388
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,530
最好是成年人
Preferably an adult.

389
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,050
好吧
Okay.

390
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,950
我不能给你钱
So, I can't pay you,

391
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,800
但可以给你一部分股份
but I can offer you a percentage of the company.

392
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,070
为什么选我
Why me?

393
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,560
我手下全是搞软件的码农
My house is running wild with code monkeys.

394
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,990
我需要个有硬件经验
I need someone with real hardware experience and 

395
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,970
注重细节的人
attention to detail.

396
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,340
-你们想做什么  -建立人与人的联系
- Well, what's the idea? - Connecting people.

397
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,910
一拨号  就能用电话线跟真人一起玩游戏
You dial in, you play games across phone lines with real humans.

398
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,810
我们要编写界面  游戏什么的
We're writing the interface, the games, everything.

399
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,270
但电话线不够快啊
But phone lines aren't fast enough.

400
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,610
我有一个相移调幅协议
I've got a phase-shifting and amplitude modulation protocol 

401
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,520
能达到9600波特
that breaks 9600 baud.

402
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,470
用户订阅  我们邮寄调制解调器和软件
You subscribe. You get a modem and software in the mail.

403
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,580
等等  你到底什么目的
Wait, what is this really?

404
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,900
是想报复吗
Some sort of revenge hire?

405
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,230
用这种方式来报复戈登
Some screwed-up way of getting back at Gordon?

406
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,160
我可不是
Because I am not some pawn

407
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,970
你们三个变态的博弈中的
in whatever twisted chess match

408
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,430
一个小棋子
the three of you play with each other.

409
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,530
唐娜
Donna.

410
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,820
我很荣幸  谢谢
I'm flattered, thanks.

411
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,350
但还是算了
But, no, thanks.

412
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,790
好吧  随你便
Okay. Suit yourself.

413
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,110
你要见我
You wanted to see me?

414
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,690
-乔  -别说了
- Look, Joe-- - Save your breath.

415
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,070
我没招了
You got me.

416
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:30,410
程序员都跑了  别想再搞出什么杀手应用了
Coders are gone. Any chance of a killer app is dead.

417
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,610
你说得对  电脑可以了
You're right. It's ready.

418
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,020
好吧
Okay.

419
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,950
其他样机出现此类问题了吗
Did any other test boxes display the same problem?

420
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,860
就那一台
Just the one.

421
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,660
十万台中的一千台  这是1%
A thousand machines out of a hundred thousand, one percent?

422
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,930
退货率很低
Return rate will be less.

423
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:50,530
不会影响利润率
We won't even feel it in the profit margin.

424
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,490
你什么意思
So, what are you saying, exactly?

425
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,740
发货吧
Ship it.

426
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,560
你在干什么呢
What are you working on?

427
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,430
打印驱动程序
Just a print driver.

428
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,390
裁缝剪裁地怪怪的
I think the tailor cut it weird.

429
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,390
戈登  你穿着太帅气了  真棒
Gordon, that looks so good on you. You look great.

430
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,080
乔肯定会...
Well, you know, Joe's gonna be all--

431
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,070
他是他
Oh, Joe is Joe.

432
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,300
你做自己就好  来
You be yourself. Here.

433
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,340
不好吧
Ah, I don't know.

434
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,940
-等我10分钟  -我们要迟了
- Give me 10 minutes. - We're gonna be late.

435
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,860
这是我的电脑  让他们等吧
Well, it's my computer. They can wait for me.

436
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,030
我已经在跟大力神商讨
I'm already talking to Hercules

437
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,030
{\pos(212,252)}计算机外围设备制造商

438
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,720
下一代电脑直接将他们的
about placing their CGA technology

439
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,070
彩色图形配置器技术添加在我们的主板上
directly onto our motherboard for the next iteration.

440
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,100
太棒了
Fantastic.

441
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,530
抱歉  唐娜
I'm sorry-- Donna--

442
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,140
盖尔  抱歉  这是我妻子  唐娜
Gayle, I apologize, this is my wife Donna.

443
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,520
认识你真高兴
Oh, so pleased to meet you.

444
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,130
-谢谢  我也是  -戈登
- Thank you, likewise. - Hey, Gordon, 

445
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,330
戈登  过来下
Gordon. Come tell 'em...

446
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,690
你们稍等我一下
Can you guys excuse me for just one moment?

447
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,220
真忙啊
Busy bee. 

448
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,160
你是做什么的
So, what do you do?

449
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,400
我现在没有工作
Oh, I-- uh, I'm not working presently.

450
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,090
他剃了胡子好精神啊
So, he looks great without the beard.

451
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,640
-嗯  -看上去更像管事的了
- Yeah. - It makes him look so in charge, you know?

452
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,190
那...
Well...

453
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,390
你卖出了第一台电脑
Well, you sold your first computer.

454
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,480
这倒提醒我了
Mm-hmm-- mm, which reminds me.

455
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,270
我们来这儿干什么
What-- what are we doing in here?

456
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,030
-站在这儿  -好
- Here. Stand right there. - Okay.

457
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,460
戈登
Gordon?

458
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,930
手伸出来
Give me your hand.

459
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,630
我九年前向你许下了一个诺言
I made a promise to you nine years ago.

460
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,330
戈登
Oh, Gordon.

461
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,770
跟原来那个一样
It's just like the original one

462
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,200
多字码密码也是一样的
with the same polyalphabetic cipher.

463
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:00,650
我好爱你
I "darf" you very "gerp."

464
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,760
我会爱你直到我停止呼吸
I'll "darf" you to the day I "zof."

465
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,090
戈登  他们找你呢
Gordon, they're asking for you.

466
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,670
大家  听我说
All right, everyone, listen up.

467
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,170
请大家前往停车场
I'd like to invite you all out to the parking lot

468
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,960
卡迪夫巨人的第一批电脑
where the first shipment of Cardiff Giants

469
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:34,970
正在那里等待登上处女航
is waiting to be christened for its maiden voyage.

470
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:50,510
首先  我想说
first off, I'd like to start by saying that 

471
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,530
今晚  我能站在这里
I wouldn't be standing here tonight

472
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,290
站在大家面前
in front of all of you

473
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,140
多亏了乔·麦克米伦
if it weren't for Joe MacMillan.

474
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,080
我们都该感谢他
None of us would be.

475
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,640
有时候你得逼着我们向前进
Sometimes you had to drag us forward kicking and screaming,

476
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,160
但到头来  你是对的
but in the end, you were right.

477
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,180
卡迪夫巨人是你本人的化身
The Cardiff Giant is an incarnation of everything you are.

478
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,660
它体现了你的高瞻远瞩和其影响
It shows the reach and power of your vision

479
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,990
以及你作为领袖的过人能力
and the very best of your abilities as a leader.

480
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,720
敬我的搭档  乔·麦克米伦
To my partner, Joe MacMillan.

481
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,780
乔
To Joe!

482
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,010
还有我妻子  唐娜呢
And to my wife-- where's Donna?

483
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:28,190
敬我另一位搭档  如果不是她  我会彻底迷失
To my other partner, without whom I'd be completely lost.

484
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,090
我爱你
I love you, honey.

485
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,190
我也爱你  戈登
I love you, too, Gordon.

486
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,820
这辆车将在天明出发
This vessel departs at dawn.

487
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,140
好运  老天保佑
Good luck and Godspeed!

488
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:56,030
巨人  巨人
Giant! Giant! Giant!

489
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,380
小心头
Watch your head.

490
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,240
等我一下
Hey, just give me a minute.

491
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,320
难以置信
I can't believe it.

492
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,610
感觉好不真实
It just doesn't seem real.

493
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,320
是啊
Yeah.

494
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:36,270
明早办公室见
Well, I'll see you in the office in the morning,

495
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,320
-一大早  -到时见
- bright and early. - See you then.

496
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,560
谢谢了
Thanks.

497
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,660
谢谢你做的一切
For everything.

498
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:01,140
记得乔跟踪我们去看《绝地大反击》吗
'Member when Joe followed us to "Return of the Jedi"?

499
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:07,040
你说他真看那部电影了吗
Do you think he even watched the movie?

500
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,190
没有
I know he didn't.

501
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,160
几个月前  我说那些程序员是一群依娃祖人
A few months ago, I called the coders a bunch of Ewoks.

502
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,570
他根本不知道什么意思
He had no idea what I was talking about.

503
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,820
那他怎么会有爆米花
Then why did he have popcorn?

504
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:27,500
他大概只是想装装样子吧
I think he just wanted to look more normal.

505
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,390
该死的
Son of a bitch.

506
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,460
有人撞了我们吗
Did somebody hit us?

507
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,230
这可是保时捷
You just hit a Porsche, buddy.

508
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,790
希望你车保赔得起
Hope you got great insurance.

509
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,170
待在车里
Stay in the car.

510
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:58,680
你干什么啊  你撞坏了我的...
Man! What the hell, You busted the-- ah!

511
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,350
-钥匙  -在车里
- Keys! - They're in the car.

512
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,800
等等  我妻子
Wait! Wait, my wife!

513
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,280
我妻子
My wife!

514
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,300
该死
Oh, shit.

515
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,720
更多了
Even more had.

516
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,080
好吧  琼妮要酥脆的  海莉要奶油的
All right, so Joanie's crunchy and Haley's creamy.

517
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,100
不  我要奶油的  酥脆的好恶心
No, I'm creamy. Crunchy's gross.

518
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,830
我讨厌奶油的
I really hate creamy.

519
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,920
那杏味的呢
How about apricot?

520
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,920
恶心死了
That's really disgusting.

521
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,460
你们午餐盒为什么都黏黏的
Why do you have gummies all over your lunch box?

522
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,260
-我们要吃的  -那是餐后甜点
- We were gonna eat that. - That's my dessert for after lunch.

523
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,010
-糖太多了  -不多
- That's too much sugar. - No, it's not.

524
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,410
布拉斯韦尔一家周末搬走了
The Braswells moved over the weekend.

525
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:26,210
你看到搬家车了吗
Did you see? There was a truck.

526
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,070
姑娘们  出去上车上去吧
Hey, girls, why don't you go out to the van?

527
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,430
我还会像往常一样  5点回家
All right, I'll be home by 5:00 as usual

528
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,410
萝丝会来接孩子
and Rose will pick up the kids.

529
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,140
爱你哦
Love you.

530
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,690
我也爱你
Love you, too.

531
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,170
-你们系好安全带了吧  -嗯
- You guys all buckled up? - Yep.

532
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,340
拿好午餐
Here are your lunches.

533
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,210
-我肯定不会吃的  -那是当然
- I already know I'm not gonna eat it. - That's for sure.

534
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:16,150
唐娜  那晚有那么一刻
Donna, there was a moment that night

535
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,190
我以为
when I thought--

536
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,110
我以为我要失去你了
I thought I was gonna lose you

537
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,250
我绝不想失去你
and I never want to lose you.

538
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:28,310
我不能失去你  但除此之外
I can't lose you, but more than that,

539
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,390
你不能一直闷坐在这儿
you can't just sit here and stew.

540
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:37,440
你该去做你想做的事
You should do whatever it is that you want to do.

541
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,740
来卡迪夫工作吧
Come work at Cardiff.

542
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,950
我想要你做首席工程师
I want you to be the head engineer.

543
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,990
我什么都要管  根本忙不过来
I'm stretched thin running everything,

544
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,960
不管我们接下来做什么  一定要大
and whatever we do next, it needs to be big.

545
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,960
唐娜  这需要你
Donna, it-- it needs you.

546
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,320
谢谢
Thank you.

547
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,820
-谢谢你  这对我意义重大  -嗯
- Thank you, you don't know what it means to me... - Yeah? 

548
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,210
-你能来问我  -当然
- ...for you to ask. - Of course.

549
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:13,750
但我觉得我现在去卡迪夫不合适
But I don't think that Cardiff is the best place for me right now.

550
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,350
好吧
Uh, o-okay. Okay, well, 

551
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,250
你该去
you know, you should work

552
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:25,740
你想去的地方工作
wherever it is that you want to work, okay?

553
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,770
去你想去的地方
Go wherever your heart takes you.

554
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:32,140
不论如何  我都会支持你
I'm gonna support you no matter what.

555
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,420
我最近一直在想
I've been thinking.

556
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,850
前一阵有人提出要雇佣我
I actually got an offer from somewhere else a little while ago

557
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:42,950
我打算接受这份邀请
and I'm gonna take it.

558
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,990
什么
What?

559
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,590
这太棒了
That-- that-- that's fantastic.

560
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,810
太好了
That-- that's great news.

561
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,990
是哪啊
Where?

562
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,810
大家听好
All right, everyone listen up.

563
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,650
我想让大家记住几件事
Uh, I just want you guys to keep a few things in mind.

564
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,540
第一  我不是你们的老板
One, I'm not your boss. 

565
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,850
这里没有职称
Nobody here has titles.

566
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,890
只有名字
Your title is your first name.

567
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,150
我叫卡梅伦
Mine is Cameron.

568
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,590
-你好  卡梅伦  -你们好
- Hi, Cameron. - Hello.

569
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,580
而且这不是我一个人的创业  是我们的
Also, this isn't my thing. This is our thing.

570
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:19,190
所以我们是种瓜得瓜种豆得豆
Which means you'll get out of it exactly what you put into it.

571
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,470
我要付出一切
For me, it's everything.

572
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,260
对我们大家都该是如此
For all of us, it should be everything.

573
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,440
否则何必要做呢
Otherwise why even do it at all?

574
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,560
嗯
Right.

575
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,980
谢谢
Thank you.

576
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,890
还有最后一样
Uh, and just one last thing.

577
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,260
很多人会希望我们失败
A lot of people are gonna want us to fail.

578
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,150
因为我们是未来
But that's because we're the future

579
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,000
没什么比那更可怕的了
and there's nothing scarier than that.

580
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,060
说得好
Yes!

581
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,640
好了  向未来进发
All right! To the future!

582
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,300
-好  -未来
- Yes! - The future!

583
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,380
唐娜·克拉克
Donna Clark!

584
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,470
欢迎来到穆特尼
Hello, welcome to Mutiny.

585
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,270
与其他便携电脑不同
"Unlike other portables,

586
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,740
巨人令人眼前一亮
the Giant is not a strain on the back,"

587
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,230
一堆废话
blah-blah-blah.

588
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,920
总体来说  运行速度很快
"Overall, it's pretty fast."

589
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:14,250
不错  而且物美价廉
There you go. "Also a wise value at such a low price..."

590
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,320
-听上去不错  -嗯
- Sounds good to me. - Yeah.

591
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:21,380
虽然强光下液晶屏看起来比较费劲
Uh, "Despite the LCD screen being hard to read in bright light."

592
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,470
瞎说
Bullshit.

593
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,390
他拿去海滩了吗
What did he do, take it to the beach?

594
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,650
好了  这句
Okay, here we go.

595
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,570
总体上  卡迪夫巨人便携个人电脑
"Overall, the Cardiff Giant Portable PC

596
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:33,880
是一个朴实而强有力的竞争者
stands out as a strong contender in no-frills computing accommodation."

597
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,150
-好啊  -这话是绝对没错
- Okay. - We can take that to the bank.

598
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,100
不错吧
That's good, right?

599
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,010
十万台...
A hundred thousand units...

600
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,540
接下来呢
So, what's next?

601
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,780
我们接下来做什么
What are we gonna do next?

602
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,980
如果乔·麦克米伦在
If Joe MacMillan were here,

603
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,820
他大概会让我们造飞船吧
he'd have us building a damn spaceship.

604
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,190
找到他了吗
Anybody ever find that guy?

605
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,200
他好像在凯尔餐馆做厨师
I think he's a fry cook at Kel's.

606
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,100
下午好  要加油吗
Afternoon. Need a fill-up?

607
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,670
不用  谢谢
Uh, no, thanks.

608
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,560
你要去哪
Where you headed?

609
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,590
菲斯克天文台
Fiske Observatory.

610
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:14,810
是在这一带吗  地图上没有
Is that around here? I can't find it on the map.

611
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,160
因为那是两年前才建起来的
That's 'cause they just built it two years ago.

612
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,580
是那边吧
It's that way, though, right?

613
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,970
嗯  几十英里吧
Sure, a couple dozen miles.

614
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,860
离这儿一小时远处有条交流道
You know there's an access road about an hour away

615
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,440
由南往北
coming in from the south.

616
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,480
这边都是土路和老拖车
This way is just dirt roads and old horse trails.

617
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,090
都是丘陵地
Raw hills country.

618
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,090
我想走风景比较好的路
Thought I'd take the scenic route.

619
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,990
我可以把卡车留在这儿吗
Is it all right if I leave my truck here?

620
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,080
是观星的吗
Hmm, some kind of stargazer, huh?

621
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,320
嗯
Yeah.

622
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,510
我替你看着车
I'll watch your truck for you.

623
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:54,900
谢谢
Thanks.

624
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,260
菲斯克就一个人
You know there ain't nobody up at Fiske, save the one.

625
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,420
一年里大部分时候都住那儿
Lives there most of the year.

626
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,670
-她下来过吗  -不怎么下来
- She ever come down? - Not really.

627
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,260
在镇上见过她一两次  买杂货
See her in town once in a while buying groceries.

628
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,530
人还行  不知道是不是愿见客
Pleasant enough. Not sure she's used to visitors.

629
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,350
你可别挨枪子了
Don't get yourself shot.

630
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:16,960
我会小心的
I'll be careful.

631
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,360
你想去看什么啊
What do you want to see up there?

632
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,640

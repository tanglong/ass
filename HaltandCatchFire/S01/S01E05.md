	I really appreciate you coming home this morning. Thank you.
	我还得洗个澡刮刮脸赶紧去上班
	I gotta shower and shave and get back to the office.
	我是想让你看看这个

	-法式吐司  今天什么日子  -我爸的生日
	- French toast. What's the occasion? - Dad's birthday.
	我还以为你是特地回家祝寿呢
	I thought that's why you came home.
	你送给他一支球杆
	You got him a putter.
	瞧瞧  什么风把你刮回来了
	Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in.
	生日快乐
	Happy birthday.
	他可喜欢你送的球杆了
	He loves the putter.
	你道谢了吗  亲爱的
	Did you thank him, sweetheart?
	今天跟我去俱乐部打一局吧
	You should come to the club with me today. Play a quick nine?

	Um, I gotta-- I got work I gotta do.
	早上好啊  女儿们

	爸爸好
	Hi, Daddy.
	我们能带这个上学去吗

	你说这小玩意多厉害
	Isn't that thing incredible?
	是啊  这下可以整天黏在电视上了
	Yeah, now they can watch TV all the time.
	我刚和华族签了份独家协议
	I just arranged an exclusive deal with Kazoku
	把这玩意收进我们的秋季新品目录里
	to carry them in our fall catalogue.
	祝我生日快乐  是吧
	Happy birthday to me, right?
	你的电脑和IBM  XT相比怎么样
	Well, how will your computer compare to the IBM XT?
	我们的电脑不仅有IBM的全部优点
	Ours has all the same features as the XT,
	还另有额外的优势
	plus-- plus a few bonus extras.
	-比如呢  -比如
	- Like what? - Like what?
	比如你能带着这电脑去开房
	Like you can haul it down to the no-tell motel
	一边干你的秘书
	when you screw your secretary
	一边打你的备忘录
	and you'd still get your memos typed up.
	就比如这个
	"Like what?"
	你要是想拿IBM电脑玩这套
	You try that with an IBM PC,
	当心闪了老腰
	hell, you'd throw out your back.
	说说你们电脑的速度吧
	Now, what about speed?
	我们的顾客似乎只关心这个
	That seems to be all our customers care about.
	-我听说你们正在鼓捣286  -嗯
	- I heard you guys were flirting with the 286. - Yeah.
	我只是个纽约来的投机客
	Oh, I'm just a carpetbagger from New York.
	他们才不会信我
	They won't listen to me.
	先生们  我想所有的相关参数
	Gentlemen, I think-- I think all the specs
	都在你们手中的资料集里了
	are right there in those packets that we gave you.
	你们都认字吧
	Y'all can read, right?
	首先  我要澄清一下
	First of all, to clarify,
	包养小秘的费用不包括在电脑售价里
	secretary isn't included at that price.
	至于具体参数  我们的确在拿286试验
	As for the specs, we were experimenting with the 286,
	但如果真用286  你们的顾客得卖肾了
	but in the end, it would only cost your customers an arm and a leg,
	所以我们要用8兆赫兹的8086处理器
	so we're going with an eight megahertz 8086.
	这样不仅速度比市面上的产品快一倍
	That's almost twice as fast as any PC on the market,
	我们还集成了浮点运算协处理器
	plus we're including a floating-point math coprocessor
	其性能足以把IBM所有产品甩出几条街
	that will run circles around any IBM PC.
	我不妨开门见山
	Let's cut to the chase
	直截了当地回答你们想问的问题
	and get to the question you came here to have answered.
	而你们的总裁也会在
	The question your CEO
	计算机分销商展览后的会议上问这个问题
	will ask you at your post-COMDEX powwow.
	"第三排货架上该摆什么货"
	"What do we put on our third shelf?"
	不是第一排  那是留给IBM的
	Not the first shelf-- that's reserved for IBM.
	甚至不是第二排
	Not even the second shelf.
	那是留给你们的品牌电脑的
	That's where your name brand computer goes.
	就是在台湾组装  再贴上你们标签的电脑
	The ones you have manufactured in Taiwan and slap your insignia on.
	我说的是第三排
	The third shelf.
	杂牌电脑
	The "Kludge" Shelf.
	连理货勤杂工都不看好
	The shelf your stock boys detest...
	因为那些电脑太笨重
	because the computers are so heavy...
	又放在那么下面
	and the shelves are so low.
	那才是我们的位置
	That's the shelf we're talking about.
	这才是我们这些笨蛋的市场  对吗
	That's the shelf us schmucks are aiming for, am I right?
	不对
	Wrong.
	这不是一款IBM兼容克隆机
	This isn't an IBM compatible clone.
	这是新的兼容机
	This is the new compatible.
	IBM到时候得模仿我们
	IBM will have to clone us.
	把这话转达给你们总裁  我保证明年这时候
	Tell that to your CEO and I promise you this time next year,
	坐在总裁位子上的就是你们  问着
	you'll be sitting in his chair asking,
	我们在第三排架子上放什么
	"What do we put on our third shelf?"

	Is that what he told you?
	不是  他从未提起过你
	No, he never talks about you.

	But if you had to lie to the super to get into his apartment,
	我猜你们俩关系并不是很好

	The one question I have is how do you scale this to a bigger size
	而不让它模糊的
	without the display blurring?
	调高电压
	Oh, we make the voltage higher.
	调高5伏通常就够了
	Five volts usually enough, yeah.
	可是电压那么高  往屏幕上投射一个像素
	But if you zap a pixel with a voltage that high,
	周围的像素都会扭曲  那不就重影了吗
	the adjacent pixels twist, too. Don't you get ghosting?
	要是加上第三层微电容呢
	What if you laid in a third layer of microcapacitors?
	这种技术你们不是已经试验过了吗

	降低你们每台显示器的利润
	You take a lower margin on the individual screens,

	we'll give you a percentage of our profits on the back end.

	你想做什么都行
	You can do whatever you want.
	给你全权委托...
	You'll have carte blanche--
	-不行  -那好  别给卡迪夫干
	- No. - Fine, don't work for Cardiff.
	自己办公司  我找你做分包
	Form your own company. I'll hire you as a vendor.
	你可以不用见我  我...我需要你
	You'll never have to see my face. I just-- I need you.
	天哪  你真可悲
	Oh, God, you're pathetic.
	我们自己办公司
	We can start our own company.
	我离开卡迪夫
	I'll leave Cardiff.
	我们可以去加州  去哪都行
	We can go to California, go anywhere.
	白手起家
	We can start from scratch.
	我想和你在一起
	I wanna be with you.
	听着不错
	That sounds nice.
	我们合作造点什么东西
	We could build something together, a partnership.
	开创自己的未来
	Make our own future.
	不过你不是未来
	Except you're not the future.
	你只是个陪衬
	You're a footnote.
	之前你还真唬住我了
	For a while, you had me fooled.
	我还以为我对你动心了
	I mean, I thought I heard a heartbeat.
	但不是的
	But it wasn't a heartbeat.
	那只是回声
	It was an echo.
	我之前爱你...
	I loved you...
	是因为你把我的想法复述给我
	because you recited my own ideas back to me
	还假装那是你的
	and pretended they were your own.
	你想知道真相吗
	You want to know the truth?
	你还是你妈妈
	You're still exactly what you were
	让你掉下屋顶那天的那个人
	the day your mom let you fall off that roof.
	没错
	Yeah.
	一个可怜的小男孩
	Just a sad little boy...
	大有潜力  却毫无作为
	with a lot of wasted potential.
	你去哪了
	Where the hell have you been?
	It's past 11:30. Nice of you to show up.
	过来  看看这个
	Come here, you're gonna want to see this.
	他们今天都没来上班
	None of them showed up for work today.
	去哪了呢
	Where are they?
	尼尔  告诉他
	Neil, tell 'em.
	他们跳槽去穆特尼了
	They all went to work for Mutiny.
	{\pos(267,276}意为反叛
	没听说过
	I've never heard of it.
	这才是最有意思的
	Well, that's the best part.
	{\an8}欢迎来到穆特尼
	好了  你们两个去买X射线管
	Okay, I need you guys to buy as many XTs
	摆在架子上  一直到放不下
	for the shelves as you can until these max out.
	好吧  可是调制解调器固件老出毛病
	Okay, okay, but the modem firmware is bugging out all over the place.
	-我没法预计故障  -好吧
	- I can't predict the errors. - Okay--
	还得着手写协议  界面  游戏
	We need to get onto the protocols, the interface, the games.
	-好  -最好找个人专门负责硬件
	- Okay. - It'd be awesome to have someone dedicated to hardware.
	该死
	Shit.
	最好是成年人
	Preferably an adult.
	好吧
	Okay.
	我不能给你钱
	So, I can't pay you,
	但可以给你一部分股份
	but I can offer you a percentage of the company.
	为什么选我
	Why me?
	我手下全是搞软件的码农
	My house is running wild with code monkeys.
	我需要个有硬件经验
	I need someone with real hardware experience and
	注重细节的人
	attention to detail.
	-你们想做什么  -建立人与人的联系
	- Well, what's the idea? - Connecting people.
	一拨号  就能用电话线跟真人一起玩游戏
	You dial in, you play games across phone lines with real humans.
	我们要编写界面  游戏什么的
	We're writing the interface, the games, everything.
	但电话线不够快啊
	But phone lines aren't fast enough.
	我有一个相移调幅协议
	I've got a phase-shifting and amplitude modulation protocol
	能达到9600波特
	that breaks 9600 baud.
	用户订阅  我们邮寄调制解调器和软件
	You subscribe. You get a modem and software in the mail.
	等等  你到底什么目的
	Wait, what is this really?
	是想报复吗
	Some sort of revenge hire?
	用这种方式来报复戈登
	Some screwed-up way of getting back at Gordon?
	我可不是
	Because I am not some pawn
	你们三个变态的博弈中的
	in whatever twisted chess match
	一个小棋子
	the three of you play with each other.
	唐娜
	Donna.
	我很荣幸  谢谢
	I'm flattered, thanks.
	但还是算了
	But, no, thanks.
	好吧  随你便
	Okay. Suit yourself.
	你要见我
	You wanted to see me?
	-乔  -别说了
	- Look, Joe-- - Save your breath.
	我没招了
	You got me.
	程序员都跑了  别想再搞出什么杀手应用了
	Coders are gone. Any chance of a killer app is dead.
	你说得对  电脑可以了
	You're right. It's ready.
	好吧
	Okay.
	其他样机出现此类问题了吗
	Did any other test boxes display the same problem?
	就那一台
	Just the one.
	十万台中的一千台  这是1%
	A thousand machines out of a hundred thousand, one percent?
	退货率很低
	Return rate will be less.
	不会影响利润率
	We won't even feel it in the profit margin.
	你什么意思
	So, what are you saying, exactly?
	发货吧
	Ship it.
	你在干什么呢
	What are you working on?
	打印驱动程序
	Just a print driver.
	裁缝剪裁地怪怪的
	I think the tailor cut it weird.
	戈登  你穿着太帅气了  真棒
	Gordon, that looks so good on you. You look great.
	乔肯定会...
	Well, you know, Joe's gonna be all--
	他是他
	Oh, Joe is Joe.
	你做自己就好  来
	You be yourself. Here.
	不好吧
	Ah, I don't know.
	-等我10分钟  -我们要迟了
	- Give me 10 minutes. - We're gonna be late.
	这是我的电脑  让他们等吧
	Well, it's my computer. They can wait for me.
	我已经在跟大力神商讨
	I'm already talking to Hercules
	{\pos(212,252)}计算机外围设备制造商

	Fantastic.
	抱歉  唐娜
	I'm sorry-- Donna--
	盖尔  抱歉  这是我妻子  唐娜
	Gayle, I apologize, this is my wife Donna.
	认识你真高兴
	Oh, so pleased to meet you.
	-谢谢  我也是  -戈登
	- Thank you, likewise. - Hey, Gordon,
	戈登  过来下
	Gordon. Come tell 'em...
	你们稍等我一下
	Can you guys excuse me for just one moment?
	真忙啊
	Busy bee.
	你是做什么的
	So, what do you do?
	我现在没有工作
	Oh, I-- uh, I'm not working presently.
	他剃了胡子好精神啊
	So, he looks great without the beard.
	-嗯  -看上去更像管事的了
	- Yeah. - It makes him look so in charge, you know?
	那...
	Well...
	你卖出了第一台电脑
	Well, you sold your first computer.
	这倒提醒我了
	Mm-hmm-- mm, which reminds me.
	我们来这儿干什么
	What-- what are we doing in here?
	-站在这儿  -好
	- Here. Stand right there. - Okay.
	戈登
	Gordon?
	手伸出来
	Give me your hand.
	我九年前向你许下了一个诺言
	I made a promise to you nine years ago.
	戈登
	Oh, Gordon.
	跟原来那个一样
	It's just like the original one
	多字码密码也是一样的
	with the same polyalphabetic cipher.
	我好爱你
	I "darf" you very "gerp."
	我会爱你直到我停止呼吸
	I'll "darf" you to the day I "zof."
	戈登  他们找你呢
	Gordon, they're asking for you.
	大家  听我说
	All right, everyone, listen up.
	请大家前往停车场
	I'd like to invite you all out to the parking lot
	卡迪夫巨人的第一批电脑
	where the first shipment of Cardiff Giants
	正在那里等待登上处女航
	is waiting to be christened for its maiden voyage.
	首先  我想说
	first off, I'd like to start by saying that
	今晚  我能站在这里
	I wouldn't be standing here tonight
	站在大家面前
	in front of all of you
	多亏了乔·麦克米伦
	if it weren't for Joe MacMillan.
	我们都该感谢他
	None of us would be.
	有时候你得逼着我们向前进
	Sometimes you had to drag us forward kicking and screaming,
	但到头来  你是对的
	but in the end, you were right.
	卡迪夫巨人是你本人的化身
	The Cardiff Giant is an incarnation of everything you are.
	它体现了你的高瞻远瞩和其影响
	It shows the reach and power of your vision
	以及你作为领袖的过人能力
	and the very best of your abilities as a leader.
	敬我的搭档  乔·麦克米伦
	To my partner, Joe MacMillan.
	乔
	To Joe!
	还有我妻子  唐娜呢
	And to my wife-- where's Donna?
	敬我另一位搭档  如果不是她  我会彻底迷失
	To my other partner, without whom I'd be completely lost.
	我爱你
	I love you, honey.
	我也爱你  戈登
	I love you, too, Gordon.
	这辆车将在天明出发
	This vessel departs at dawn.
	好运  老天保佑
	Good luck and Godspeed!
	巨人  巨人
	Giant! Giant! Giant!
	小心头
	Watch your head.
	等我一下
	Hey, just give me a minute.
	难以置信
	I can't believe it.
	感觉好不真实
	It just doesn't seem real.
	是啊
	Yeah.
	明早办公室见
	Well, I'll see you in the office in the morning,
	-一大早  -到时见
	- bright and early. - See you then.
	谢谢了
	Thanks.
	谢谢你做的一切
	For everything.
	记得乔跟踪我们去看《绝地大反击》吗
	'Member when Joe followed us to "Return of the Jedi"?
	你说他真看那部电影了吗
	Do you think he even watched the movie?
	没有
	I know he didn't.
	几个月前  我说那些程序员是一群依娃祖人
	A few months ago, I called the coders a bunch of Ewoks.
	他根本不知道什么意思
	He had no idea what I was talking about.
	那他怎么会有爆米花
	Then why did he have popcorn?
	他大概只是想装装样子吧
	I think he just wanted to look more normal.
	该死的
	Son of a bitch.
	有人撞了我们吗
	Did somebody hit us?
	这可是保时捷
	You just hit a Porsche, buddy.
	希望你车保赔得起
	Hope you got great insurance.
	待在车里
	Stay in the car.
	你干什么啊  你撞坏了我的...
	Man! What the hell, You busted the-- ah!
	-钥匙  -在车里
	- Keys! - They're in the car.
	等等  我妻子
	Wait! Wait, my wife!
	我妻子
	My wife!
	该死
	Oh, shit.
	更多了
	Even more had.
	好吧  琼妮要酥脆的  海莉要奶油的
	All right, so Joanie's crunchy and Haley's creamy.
	不  我要奶油的  酥脆的好恶心
	No, I'm creamy. Crunchy's gross.
	我讨厌奶油的
	I really hate creamy.
	那杏味的呢
	How about apricot?
	恶心死了
	That's really disgusting.
	你们午餐盒为什么都黏黏的
	Why do you have gummies all over your lunch box?
	-我们要吃的  -那是餐后甜点
	- We were gonna eat that. - That's my dessert for after lunch.
	-糖太多了  -不多
	- That's too much sugar. - No, it's not.
	布拉斯韦尔一家周末搬走了
	The Braswells moved over the weekend.
	你看到搬家车了吗
	Did you see? There was a truck.
	姑娘们  出去上车上去吧
	Hey, girls, why don't you go out to the van?
	我还会像往常一样  5点回家
	All right, I'll be home by 5:00 as usual
	萝丝会来接孩子
	and Rose will pick up the kids.
	爱你哦
	Love you.
	我也爱你
	Love you, too.
	-你们系好安全带了吧  -嗯
	- You guys all buckled up? - Yep.
	拿好午餐
	Here are your lunches.
	-我肯定不会吃的  -那是当然
	- I already know I'm not gonna eat it. - That's for sure.
	唐娜  那晚有那么一刻
	Donna, there was a moment that night
	我以为
	when I thought--
	我以为我要失去你了
	I thought I was gonna lose you
	我绝不想失去你
	and I never want to lose you.
	我不能失去你  但除此之外
	I can't lose you, but more than that,
	你不能一直闷坐在这儿
	you can't just sit here and stew.
	你该去做你想做的事
	You should do whatever it is that you want to do.
	来卡迪夫工作吧
	Come work at Cardiff.
	我想要你做首席工程师
	I want you to be the head engineer.
	我什么都要管  根本忙不过来
	I'm stretched thin running everything,
	不管我们接下来做什么  一定要大
	and whatever we do next, it needs to be big.
	唐娜  这需要你
	Donna, it-- it needs you.
	谢谢
	Thank you.
	-谢谢你  这对我意义重大  -嗯
	- Thank you, you don't know what it means to me... - Yeah?
	-你能来问我  -当然
	- ...for you to ask. - Of course.
	但我觉得我现在去卡迪夫不合适
	But I don't think that Cardiff is the best place for me right now.
	好吧
	Uh, o-okay. Okay, well,
	你该去
	you know, you should work
	你想去的地方工作
	wherever it is that you want to work, okay?
	去你想去的地方
	Go wherever your heart takes you.
	不论如何  我都会支持你
	I'm gonna support you no matter what.
	我最近一直在想
	I've been thinking.
	前一阵有人提出要雇佣我
	I actually got an offer from somewhere else a little while ago
	我打算接受这份邀请
	and I'm gonna take it.
	什么
	What?
	这太棒了
	That-- that-- that's fantastic.
	太好了
	That-- that's great news.
	是哪啊
	Where?
	大家听好
	All right, everyone listen up.
	我想让大家记住几件事
	Uh, I just want you guys to keep a few things in mind.
	第一  我不是你们的老板
	One, I'm not your boss.
	这里没有职称
	Nobody here has titles.
	只有名字
	Your title is your first name.
	我叫卡梅伦
	Mine is Cameron.
	-你好  卡梅伦  -你们好
	- Hi, Cameron. - Hello.
	而且这不是我一个人的创业  是我们的
	Also, this isn't my thing. This is our thing.
	所以我们是种瓜得瓜种豆得豆
	Which means you'll get out of it exactly what you put into it.
	我要付出一切
	For me, it's everything.
	对我们大家都该是如此
	For all of us, it should be everything.
	否则何必要做呢
	Otherwise why even do it at all?
	嗯
	Right.
	谢谢
	Thank you.
	还有最后一样
	Uh, and just one last thing.
	很多人会希望我们失败
	A lot of people are gonna want us to fail.
	因为我们是未来
	But that's because we're the future
	没什么比那更可怕的了
	and there's nothing scarier than that.
	说得好
	Yes!
	好了  向未来进发
	All right! To the future!
	-好  -未来
	- Yes! - The future!
	唐娜·克拉克
	Donna Clark!
	欢迎来到穆特尼
	Hello, welcome to Mutiny.
	与其他便携电脑不同
	"Unlike other portables,
	巨人令人眼前一亮
	the Giant is not a strain on the back,"
	一堆废话
	blah-blah-blah.
	总体来说  运行速度很快
	"Overall, it's pretty fast."
	不错  而且物美价廉
	There you go. "Also a wise value at such a low price..."
	-听上去不错  -嗯
	- Sounds good to me. - Yeah.
	虽然强光下液晶屏看起来比较费劲
	Uh, "Despite the LCD screen being hard to read in bright light."
	瞎说
	Bullshit.
	他拿去海滩了吗
	What did he do, take it to the beach?
	好了  这句
	Okay, here we go.
	总体上  卡迪夫巨人便携个人电脑
	"Overall, the Cardiff Giant Portable PC
	是一个朴实而强有力的竞争者
	stands out as a strong contender in no-frills computing accommodation."
	-好啊  -这话是绝对没错
	- Okay. - We can take that to the bank.
	不错吧
	That's good, right?
	十万台...
	A hundred thousand units...
	接下来呢
	So, what's next?
	我们接下来做什么
	What are we gonna do next?
	如果乔·麦克米伦在
	If Joe MacMillan were here,
	他大概会让我们造飞船吧
	he'd have us building a damn spaceship.
	找到他了吗
	Anybody ever find that guy?
	他好像在凯尔餐馆做厨师
	I think he's a fry cook at Kel's.
	下午好  要加油吗
	Afternoon. Need a fill-up?
	不用  谢谢
	Uh, no, thanks.
	你要去哪
	Where you headed?
	菲斯克天文台
	Fiske Observatory.
	是在这一带吗  地图上没有
	Is that around here? I can't find it on the map.
	因为那是两年前才建起来的
	That's 'cause they just built it two years ago.
	是那边吧
	It's that way, though, right?
	嗯  几十英里吧
	Sure, a couple dozen miles.
	离这儿一小时远处有条交流道
	You know there's an access road about an hour away
	由南往北
	coming in from the south.
	这边都是土路和老拖车
	This way is just dirt roads and old horse trails.
	都是丘陵地
	Raw hills country.
	我想走风景比较好的路
	Thought I'd take the scenic route.
	我可以把卡车留在这儿吗
	Is it all right if I leave my truck here?
	是观星的吗
	Hmm, some kind of stargazer, huh?
	嗯
	Yeah.
	我替你看着车
	I'll watch your truck for you.
	谢谢
	Thanks.
	菲斯克就一个人
	You know there ain't nobody up at Fiske, save the one.
	一年里大部分时候都住那儿
	Lives there most of the year.
	-她下来过吗  -不怎么下来
	- She ever come down? - Not really.
	在镇上见过她一两次  买杂货
	See her in town once in a while buying groceries.
	人还行  不知道是不是愿见客
	Pleasant enough. Not sure she's used to visitors.
	你可别挨枪子了
	Don't get yourself shot.
	我会小心的
	I'll be careful.
	你想去看什么啊
	What do you want to see up there?
	莱夫
	Lev.
	这是做硬件的  唐娜
	This is hardware, Donna.
	嗯  你想看看...
	Yeah, do you want to see your...

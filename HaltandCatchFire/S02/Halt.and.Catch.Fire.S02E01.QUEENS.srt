你整得到处都是  伙计
You're getting that shit everywhere, man.

有灰忍忍吧  我们必须扩大空间
Uh, pardon our dust, but expand we must.

66
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,380
-怎么回事  -没地方放电缆了
- What's going on? - We're running out of room for cables.

67
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,950
在到处找地方塞
We're stuffing them anywhere we can.

68

Morning!

69

-包括墙里  -好  好主意
- Including the walls. - Good, great idea.

这人上来就走F3
This guy just opened with F3.

71
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,750
为什么就没人会玩国际象棋
Why is everyone bad at chess?

72
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,030
象棋太难[硬]
Chess is hard.

73
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,280
我才硬呢
I'm hard.

74

视差刚才又崩溃了
Um, "Parallax" just crashed again.

75
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,300
真是的  查清原因
Oh, god. Find out why.

76
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,050
-莱夫  速度如何  -网慢成渣了
- Lev, how's our speed? - The networks are lagging like a bitch.

77
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,130
超载引发了许多故障
Lots of fritzing out from overload.

78
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,250
-小心  -我以为新装的电话线
- Heads up! - I feel like the new phone lines we installed

79
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,350
流量足够了
should be able to handle the volume.

80
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,010
不行  还是会延迟会掉线
No, there's still delay and drop.

81
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,550
好吧  是谁把大兵手办放微波炉里的

莱夫  能检查一下电路吗
Hey, Lev, can we check the wiring?

85
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,500
好的
Yeah, sure.

86
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,220
重新加载视差  我先把用户
I'm redirecting users over to "Tank Battle"

87
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,080
引到坦克大战上去
while we reload "Parallax."

88
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,600
给我15分钟
Give me about 15 minutes.

89
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,240
这东西重启简直堪比启动游艇
Getting this thing live again is like launching a yacht.

谁能撤销一下主菜单吗

我不希望用户为了想进入一个

已经下线的游戏挤爆系统

是我在爆系统
I'm blowing the system.

94
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,330
该死
Oh, shit.

95
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,030
怎么了  怎么了
What? What is it?

96
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,440
兄弟
Dude!

97
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,800
撞到一个门柱
Went through a stud.

98
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,330
太棒了  咱们的保证金没了
Great, there goes our security deposit.

99

Hi, my name is Chet Jensen, user handle Kickassasaurus.

102
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,900
我想报告一个视差游戏的程序错误
I'd like to report a programming error in "Parallax."

103
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,090
那个有一堆镜子的走廊没有门
The narrow hall with a bunch of mirrors has no door.

104
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,150
不  那些不是镜子  是全息图
No, not mirrors, holograms.

105
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,890
我糊涂了
Oh, flummoxing.

106
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,750
但如果我说"看全息图"
But if I say, "Look at hologram,"

107
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,640
它就会说"你看到一个物体  但那不是实物"
it just says, "You see an object, but it isn't real."

108
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,720
-你碰得到吗  -不行  这上面说
- Okay, can you touch it? - Hmm, no, it says,

109
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,230
"你把手伸入光束中  但却抓不到"
"You put your hand into the light, but cannot grasp it."

110
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,270
-而且没法出去  -你好好想想
- And there's no way out. - Okay, well, think about it.

111
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,220
如果你能把手伸入全息图里  那说明了什么
If you can put your hand in the hologram, what does that mean?

112
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,030
你得思考一下
I mean, you have to think about

113
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,780
那个房间的物理空间结构
the physical space of the room, you know?

114
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,800
记住  那些安卓男巫
And remember, the Android sorcerer

115
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,260
阴险狡诈  诡计多端
is brilliant and cunning.

116
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,050
-伙计们  -弗洛斯蒂  别再拆螺丝了
- Guys! - Hey, Frosty, don't strip any more screws, okay?

117
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,850
我得把它们旋紧  旋得非常紧
Gotta-- gotta make 'em tight, real tight.

118
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,490
上帝啊  我们必须得重新布线
Oh, my God, we have got to rewire this.

119
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,210
造机柜都来不及
We can't build the cabinets fast enough.

120
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,370
还说什么布线啊
Wiring's an afterthought.

121
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,360
-上帝啊  -等等
- Oh, boy. - Wait just a darn minute.

122
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,660
我是可以穿过全息图吗
Can I walk through the hologram?

123
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,860
-也许哦  -妈妈咪呀
- Maybe. - Holy cow!

124
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,140
想出这个主意的人简直是天才
Whoever came up with that is brilliant.

125
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,570
谢谢  是我想出来的
Thank you. I came up with that.

126
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,190
-你是视差的开发者  -网络问题
- You're the creator of "Parallax"? - Network problem.

127
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,890
-严重延时  -好事啊  说明我们很受欢迎
- Serious lag. - That's good, we're popular.

128
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,000
不  我不知道服务器主机能不能承受得住压力
No, I don't know that the server host can handle the strain

129
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,740
连调制解调器组都不一定承受得住这种负载
or even if the modem bank can stay up with the load.

130
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,390
-去他妈的双陆棋  -谢谢
- Then screw backgammon! - Thank you.

131
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,620
怎么回事
What is going on here?

132
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,430
你们几个给我住手
You guys, cut it out.

133
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,470
视差老是崩溃
"Parallax" keeps crashing

134
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,330
就是因为他那版本的双陆棋太大了
because his version of backgammon is too big.

135
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,440
-怎么可能  -有多大
- No frickin' way! - Well, how big is it?

136
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,500
超过500K
Over 500k.

137
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,710
为什么一个双陆棋要花上半兆
Why does backgammon have to be half a meg?

138
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,730
不就是个有圆形棋子  三角形图案的方形棋盘吗
It's a square with some circles and some triangles.

139
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,890
-可能是因为颜色  -有颜色挺好的
- It could be all the colors. - Color is good.

140
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,680
拜托  我们做的是靠电话线传输的网络游戏
Hello, our games have to run on phone lines,

141

不是有塑料盒装内存的游戏机
not on a plastic cartridge with a crap ton of memory.

142

是啊  所以这游戏才这么烂
Yeah, and that's why they keep sucking.

143

这游戏不烂
Look, nothing sucks, okay?

因为你装了一个巨大的双陆棋
Because you installed a big-ass version of backgammon.

146
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,700
听着  我们的问题不可能
Okay, look, backgammon cannot be the only reason

147
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,410
只出在双陆棋上  但在我们查清楚之前
that we're having problems, but until we figure it out,

我觉得我们得停机
I think we should unplug the cabinets.

Maybe rewiring everything more carefully will help with the lag.

你是说暂停网络服务吗
You mean take the network offline?

- Yeah, for a couple hours. - We can't do that.

我们已经因为运行中断收到很多投诉了
We're already getting complaints about the outages.

157
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,150
如果我们不找出故障原因  只会变得更慢
It's only gonna get slower if we don't figure out what's wrong.

我们烧了个断路器  是不是
We blew a breaker, didn't we?

162
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,120
我们不仅烧了断路器
We didn't blow the breaker.

163
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,690
好像整个街区都停电了
I think we blew the whole block.

旨在推广卡迪夫电子过去两年内设计的

-两款电脑  -对

186
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,540
设计制造它们非常有趣

00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,050
这应该就是我一直忙于解决的事吧
So I guess that's what I've been working on.

277
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,130
乔太谦虚了
Well, Joe is being very modest.

278
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,250
他没告诉你们
What he didn't tell you

279
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,630
他几乎一夜之间把一家地域性的小公司
is he took this tiny regional company and

280
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,050
变成了有全国性竞争力的个人电脑公司
turned it into a national competitor for PCs almost overnight.

281
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,200
他明天要开车去达拉斯
He's driving up to Dallas tomorrow

282
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200

- But that's not the whole story. - No, it-- it's not.

284
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,450
但结局就是如此
But the outcome is the same.

285
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,000
那么你打算用这些钱来做什么
So what are you gonna do with all that dough?

286
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,230
我要成立一家自己的公司
I'm going to start my own company.

287
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,180

- In Silicon Valley. - What?

00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,320
你们要搬家吗
Oh, you're moving?

291
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,210
还没定下来
Nothing is written in stone.

292
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,900
不过我们真的很期待
But we're really excited.

293
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,850
我想说的是  过去就让它过去吧
My point is, the past is past,

294
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,610
我们还有更美好的明天
but tomorrow is tomorrow.

295
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,790
真荒唐
This is ridiculous.

296
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,190
不知道雅达利会不会也这样断电
I wonder how often the power goes out at Atari.

297
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,790
总算来电了
Oh, finally.

298
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,120
好吧  那是什么
Okay, what is that?

299
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,900
卡梅伦解决了我们的供电问题
Uh, Cameron fixed our power problem.

300
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,670
是啊  我们把延长线
Yeah, we just ran extension cords

301
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,360
接到了邻居家的室外插座上
to the outdoor sockets next door.

302
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,170
好吧  拜托告诉我  你得到安德森家的准许
Okay, please tell me that you asked the Andersons' permission

303
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,600
才借用他们家的电
to siphon off their meter.

就当做是"涓滴"电力好了
Think of it as trickle-down electricity.

307

这问题可能比你想得要大
This is a bigger problem than you might think.

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,990
达拉斯电力公司知道我们的断路器超负荷了
Dallas Power & Light knows that we overrode our circuit breaker.

309
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,820

saying that the house isn't zoned for commercial use.

311
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,560
我们将面临各种罚款
We're facing all kinds of fines,

312
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,600
所以我们最好还是不要再犯法了
so it would be really great if we stop breaking more laws

313
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,980
鉴于我们已经违反很多法规了
on top of the ones we've already broken.

而且我们能应付罚款  行吗

00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,420
唯一要解决的问题是延迟
The only real issue is the lag

317
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,950
我们得用更多网络设备和电脑来解决

是的  我们就需要先治标
Yes, which is what we need

322
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,830
好撑到真正治本

But you know what I'm gonna spend it on first is our kids.

418

我知道这话我说了很久了

可他们还在用对话框说话
and they're still talking to each other in the chatbox.

435
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,800
他们一小时付5块钱
They're paying five bucks an hour

436
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,610
就在这儿聊春假要做什么吗

454

我们公司的电脑

470
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,950
好搭建更好的东西

你毁了别人的生活

492
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,600
我朋友约翰·博斯沃思进了监狱

493
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,870
为了什么

有些人说这次出售很成功
Some folks say this sale's a success.

497

我父亲大概会说

这就是阉割公牛

你现在退出市场也好

更不会带上你

你个自以为是的混蛋

I'm just saying that the price should come down a little.

543
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,980
这是零售  不是批发
This is retail, not wholesale.

544
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,320
这东西还是偷的呢
Oh, well, technically they're stolen.

545
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,030
唐娜  你怎么回事啊
Donna, what is wrong with you?

546
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,590
要不要XT了
You want the XTs or not?

547
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,920
我可以插电看看吗
Do you mind if I plug these in?

548
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,210
我带了逆变器
I brought a power inverter.

549
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,210
不可以
Yeah, I do mind.

550
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,440
好吧  我们要了
Yeah, okay, we'll take them.

551
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,750
三千
Three grand.

552
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,030
五百
500.

553
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,190
这东西销售价是7500呢
These things list for 7,500 each.

554
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,480
我们又没去商店买
Yeah, we're not paying list.

555
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:30,040
你俩挺大胆啊  就俩女人单独出来
That's pretty ballsy, the two of you out here alone.

556
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,480
是啊
Yeah.

557
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:36,440
好吧
Okay.

558
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,490
给
Here you go.

559
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,240
二位回头再找我啊
You ladies look me up post-Armageddon.

560
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,560
尤其是你  大妈
Especially you, Mrs. Garrett.

561
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,380
听上去是好用的
Well, it sounds functional.

562
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,250
搞什么
What the hell?

563
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,460
等等  给我手电
Hang on. Flashlight.

564
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:26,960
是仿造品
It's a counterfeit.

565
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,840
那能用吗
Can we still use them?

566
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,190
你会用中文编码吗
Can you code in Chinese?

567
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,880
他骗了我们
He ripped us off.

568
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,250
好吧
Okay.

569
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,490
妈妈不来了  是吗
Mommy isn't coming, is she?

570
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,280
嗯  妈妈又得加班了
No, mommy's got to work late again.

571
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,280
我们还是可以去庆祝的啊
Hey, we could still go celebrate.

572
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,480
你们晚餐想吃冰淇淋吗
Y'all wanna go get some ice cream for dinner?

573
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,880
想去布拉姆冰淇淋店吗
Y'all wanna go to Braum's?

574
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,340
-好啊  -想吃什么都行
- Yeah! - Whatever you want?

575
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,700
-好啊  -好  我们走
- Yes! Yes! - Yeah, all right! Let's go.

576
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,950
我们去吃香草冰淇淋
We'll get some vanilla ice cream,

577
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,820
加软糖香蕉
hot fudge, and bananas.

578
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,590
好棒
Yes!

579
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,020
爸爸  我们现在有钱了吗
Daddy, are we rich now?

580
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,810
我不知道该怎么回答你  亲爱的
I'm not quite sure how to answer that question, sweetheart.

581
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,930
我们是百万富翁了吗
Well, are we millionaires?

582
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,250
接下来四五年如果投资得当
With some smart investments in the next four or five years,

583
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,260
嗯  有可能的
yeah, we certainly could be.

584
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,920
我们可以买大象吗
Can we buy an elephant?

585
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,120
或许吧
Maybe.

586
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,390
理论上是可以的
I mean, theoretically.

587
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,440
那能吗
So, can we?

588
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,750
你不能只买一只大象
Well, you never wanna get just one elephant.

589
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,830
大象是很敏感的动物  如果只买一只
Elephants are sensitive creatures and if you just get one,

590
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,810
它会觉得孤单的
then it'll get lonely.

591
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,250
所以至少得买两只
You got to get at least two elephants.

592
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,250
老实说  亲爱的
And, frankly, sweetheart,

593
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,630
我觉得咱家地方不够大
I don't think we have the room.

594
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:53,950
既然我们都有钱了
If we're rich now,

595
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,660
那妈妈怎么还工作到那么晚
then why does mommy have to work so late?

596
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,820
知道吗  问得有道理
You know what? That's a good question.

597
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,020
爸爸  你的鼻子
Daddy, your nose.

598
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,290
爸爸
Daddy!

599
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,920
老天  我没事
Oh, my god. I'm okay.

600
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,950
我没事  乖乖  我就回来
I'm okay, girls. I'll be right back.

601
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,810
天呐  我记得我第一次见你时
Jesus, I remember the first time I met you,

602
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:20,950
你就像狄乐百货产品名录上的商务女性
just a perfect Dillard's catalogue businesswoman

603
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,460
看什么都不顺眼
with big judging eyes.

604
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,050
我才没有
Oh, I wasn't judging.

605
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,850
我只是看戈登看惯了
I'm just used to looking at Gordon.

606
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,930
这混蛋在哪
Oh, where is this asshole?

607
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,570
-你不也一样吓人  -才没有
- You're just as intimidating. - No.

608
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,650
你就是的  你还以此为傲
You know you are. You pride yourself on it.

609
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,340
记得我们推出网络的时候吗
You remember when we launched the network?

610
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,750
花了四天时间才成功上线
It took four days straight to get it live.

611
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,900
就像搭谷仓一样困难
It was like raising a barn.

612
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,420
视差从菜单上启动不了
And "Parallax" wouldn't boot from the menu.

613
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,660
到一半的时候
You know, halfway through,

614
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,670
我们都以为是成不了了
a bunch of us thought it was never gonna happen.

615
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:57,550
我们完了  穆特尼还没开始就完蛋了
We were done. Mutiny was over before it even started.

616
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,910
但你不这么想  你没放弃
But not you. You didn't give up.

617
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:03,690
嗯  是挺不容易
Yeah, well, it was intense.

618
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:11,650
那么
So...

619
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,950
你觉得我该当老板
You think I should be the boss.

620
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,740
我觉得该有人当老板
I think someone should be.

621
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,880
我知道我们现在也挺好
Look, I know we're doing fine,

622
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,850
但现在就是大多数我们这样的公司倒闭的时候了
but this point right now is when most companies like us go under.

623
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,930
我们发展停滞了
We're plateauing.

624
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:32,290
我们得发展壮大起来  否则就没戏了
We need to grow in a big way or we're not gonna make it.

625
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,680
好吧  那是不行的
Okay, well, we can't let that happen.

626
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,330
我们急需很多重要必需品
We're in dire need of some major essentials.

627
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,230
我们需要更多用户  我们的订阅已经达到极限了
We need more users. Our subscriptions have topped out.

628
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,270
我们需要新游戏
We need another game.

629
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:44,230
我们都六个月没发布新东西了
We haven't put anything out in, what, six months.

630
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,680
我知道  唐娜  但我得等最佳的点子
Yes, I know, Donna, but I need to wait for the right idea.

631
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,660
而且我们得扩张网络
And we need to expand the network

632
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:53,510
光靠买偷来的XT已经不够了
because buying stolen XTs isn't gonna cut it anymore.

633
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,570
你说得对
You're right.

634
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,900
你说得都对
You're-- yes, you're totally right.

635
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,430
但是
But here's the thing. I--

636
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:04,070
我不想当家做主
I'm not interested in being in charge.

637
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,390
我想工作  做我喜欢做的
I want to work, I want to do my thing.

638
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:10,700
我不想做产品管理
I'm not interested in product managing.

639
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,170
我也一样
Well, I'm not either.

640
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,150
我注意到用户玩游戏时
Look, I've been watching people chat on the network

641
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,600
在线上聊天  有时候游戏打完还能聊几个小时
while they're playing, sometimes even after for hours on end,

642
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,440
我觉得完全可以借此
and I think there's a real opportunity

643
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,700
在游戏之外建立一个社区
for a community to exist outside the games.

644
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,390
如果你帮我一起管理
So if you just help me with the managerial side,

645
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,700
我就可以做做这方面
then I can play around with that

646
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,980
同时继续管理网络
and still keep my hands in the guts of the network

647
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,840
这样我就很开心了
and I'm a happy camper.

648
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,900
死混蛋
Son of a bitch.

649
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,640
混蛋
Hey, dickhead.

650
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,200
你卖给我们的电脑是仿造品
Those computers you sold us were counterfeits.

651
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,260
真遗憾
Bummer.

652
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,840
我们想要回我们的钱
We want our money back.

653
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,520
抱歉  女士们
Sorry, ladies.

654
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,420
不行  五百  掏出来
Uh, no, 500 on the bar now.

655
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,480
过来
Come here.

656
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,400
-乔  -好了
- Joe! - Okay!

657
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,880
好了  抱歉打扰你了
Okay, okay, we're sorry we bothered you.

658
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,170
再见
Good-bye.

659
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:12,920
好了
Okay.

660
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,860
我们的好运也该到头了
Well, I think we pushed our luck about as far as it's gonna go.

661
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,990
什么
What?

662
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,210
你怎么...
How did you--?

663
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:42,600
这混蛋有两台崭新的XT  还没开箱呢
Hey, that little shit has two brand-new XTs back here in boxes.

664
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,420
什么
What?!

665
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,900
别拿钱了  拿走装备
Leave the money, just grab the gear.

666
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,090
开车门
Open the trunk!

667
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,610
给我
Give it to me.

668
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,010
我抱住了
Okay, I got it.

669
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,420
小偷
Scavengers!

670
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,580
你还想要我的电话吗
Hey, you still want my number?

671
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,480
搞什么
What the hell?

672
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,650
你没事吧
You all right?

673
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,610
嗯
Yep.

674
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,620
你的鼻子怎么了
What happened to your nose?

675
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,370
过敏
Allergies.

676
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,820
你没赶上晚饭
We missed you at dinner.

677
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,010
是啊  真抱歉
I know, I'm sorry.

678
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,980
没事
It's fine.

679
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,560
等我下次卖公司我们再去吧
We'll just go out next time I sell a company.

680
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,340
-你喝醉了吗  -我没事
- Are you drunk? - I'm fine.

681
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:10,130
工作...工作上的事闹得很疯
Work just went-- oh, I don't know. Work went insane.

682
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,470
我给你留了一块布拉姆的山核桃派

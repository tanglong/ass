你知道你们的网络为什么出问题吗
You know why your network's on the fritz...

37
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,840
有人蹭网
freeloaders. Ghosts.

38
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,640
-我们知道有多少用户  -合法用户

39
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,800
而蹭网的人占用了你们的带宽

找到全部用户

42
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,950
描绘出你们实际的用户分布呢

43
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,020
我称之为索纳里斯
I call it Sonaris.

44

is as shortsighted as a lemur with cataracts."

46
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,680
他们管这叫"网络论战"
They call it a "Flame war."

47
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,430
唐娜  我写这个程序可是为了你
Donna, you realize I'm doing this for you, you know?

48
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,960
-我知道  -你能不能...
- Yeah, I know. - Could you at...

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,180
你一定很投入
And you must really be enjoying it

50
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,150
因为我都两周没见你了
because I haven't seen you for two weeks.

51
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,820
你能看看吗  好吗
Okay, well, will you take a look, okay?

52
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,150
我快写完了
I'm almost done.

00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,430
-说说看  -什么
- But tell me something. - What?

54
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,080
谁是你的超人
Who's your Superman?

-车拿去修了吗  -是啊
- Is your car in the shop? - Yep.

65
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,960
自行车不错
Nice wheels.

66
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,440
有喇叭吗
Does it have a horn?

67
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,250
一定是落家里了  还有我的小丑鼻子
Must've left it at home with my clown nose.

68
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,990

房子给了靳妮
Well, Ginnie got the house,

其余的都归了公
Feds got everything else.

71
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,060
除了这辆车
Oh, but not this.

72
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,560

75
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,900
帮我留住车  让我借住
holding on to this, putting me up,

76
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,700
保护我不被生吞活剥
keeping the jackals at bay.

77
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,180
而你给了我二十年的饭碗
And you put food on my table for, what, 20 years?

78
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,480
我该怎么报答你
Anything I can do to repay you?

79
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,920
你可以上车  像个爷们儿一样把车开走
You can get in that tank and drive it like a man.

80
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,580
好
All right.

81
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,940
这就对了

- Thanks, Eugene. - Fine, that's just fine.

86
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,170
不过我有几个点子
I've got some ideas, though.

87
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,680
我们复查这些文件避免扫描错误
We double-check all these documents for scanning errors.

88
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,270
-是啊  -我有时候会发现
- Yes, sir. - And sometimes I'll notice a correlation

89
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,770
油井的钻孔深度和抽取速率有关
between a well's perforation level and its drainage rate

90
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,330
我会把它记在这儿
and I'll make a note of it here.

91
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,920
如果我们都做记录
And if we all took those notes,

92
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,580
就可以把数据录入电子表格
we could harvest them into spreadsheets,

93
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,250
-也许就能发现...  -数据处理
- maybe find some... - Data processing...

94
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,200
-怎么了  -在地下一层
- Yeah? - ...is on B1.

95
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,260
这里是数据录入部
This is data entry.

96
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,880
看见那主机了吗  我们的工作是填满它
That mainframe in there? Our job is to fill it up.

97
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,170
铲沙子而不是数谷子
Shovel sand, not count the grains.

98
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,370
-你不觉得有问题吗  -不觉得
- And that doesn't bother you? - No.

99
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,580
我知道盯着60年的井深数据看
Listen, I know staring at 60 years of well depths

100
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,990
不是刺激的工作
ain't exactly hair-raising.

101
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,460
所以最好有点消遣活动
That's why it helps to have a pastime.

102
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,160
我们在举行诱饵装饰比赛
We're doing a decoy decorating contest.

103
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,390
公鸭或母鸡  随你挑
Drakes or hens, your choice.

104
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,220
我收集老式打击乐器
I myself... I collect vintage percussion.

105
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,000
这个周末  我有幸购得了
This weekend, I was fortunate to obtain

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,410
备受狄托·庞特[拉丁爵士大师]喜爱的天巴鼓
a timbale favored by the great Tito Puente.

107
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,110
来点咖啡吗
Do you want some coffee?

108
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,080
一双大手不断靠近抢夺你美味的果冻
Giant hands keep reaching and grabbing for your tasty Jell-O chunks.

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,290
{\pos(135.9,221.415)}点子

110
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,380
但是你躲开了
But you dodge them,

111
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,520
上上下下  一层又一层
up, down, shelf to shelf.

112
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,940
很快  冰箱就空了
Soon the fridge is empty.

113
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,520
只有你  果冻碗幸免于难
Only you, the Jell-O bowl, have survived.

114
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,250
我管它叫"摇摇乐"
I call it "Jiggles."

115
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,810
挺好  大家有什么问题吗
Cool, uh, questions, anyone?

116
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,350
-那果冻什么味的  -当然是橘子味
- Uh, what flavor the Jell-O? - Orange, obviously.

117
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,010
-摇摇乐听着像脱衣舞俱乐部  -不是的
- "Jiggles" Sounds like a strip joint. - Well, it's not.

118
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,400
只有我支持那双手吗
Am I the only one that's rooting for the hands?

119
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,020
因为这家人饿了  你又可以吃
You know, 'cause the family's hungry and you're available.

120
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,240
我觉得你就该被吃掉
I feel like it's your job to be eaten, you know?

121
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,240
除非你腐臭发霉了  放了三周了 
Unless you're rancid, moldy, like three weeks old.

122
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,450
那你可以管这叫
Yeah, and then you could call it, like,

123
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,220
"吃必死果冻"或者什么的
"Jell-O Death Wish" or something.

124
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,180
你的任务是毒死这家人  杀了他们
Your mission ... poison the family. Kill 'em all.

125
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,470
-太对了  -我的果冻没有腐烂
- Totally. - My Jell-O is not rancid.

126
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,640
好了  大家都歇会儿吧
Okay, let's just let it breathe for a second.

127
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,980

Okay, does it have a story?

133
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,730
-需要故事吗  -对  会有帮助
- Does it need one? - Uh, yeah, it helps.

134
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,740
在线游戏与游戏厅或卡带游戏不同
Online gaming is different from arcade or cartridge.

135
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,030
你要把玩家吸引到一个世界里
You're trying to draw the players into a world,

136
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,680
-而不只是骗他们投币  -你开玩笑吗
- not just hustle them for quarters... - Are you joking?

137
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,900

00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,440
只不过是个电脑游戏
It's a computer game, okay?

412
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,020
冷静一下  不会有事
Calm down. I'm sure it's nothing.

413
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,540
我看一下根文件
Let me just check the root file.

414
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,220
恶意软件攻击了我们的网络
Bad software hit our network.

415
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,480
正在覆盖我们的数据  
It's overwriting our data.

416
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,280
我们的硬盘还是用户的
Our drives or the users'?

417
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,380
-都有  -刚刚覆盖了象棋
- Both. - It just ate chess.

418
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,730
-什么  -我们需要隔离没受到影响的机器
- What? - Hey, we need to quarantine all the unaffected machines.

419
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:26,080
-不行  -现在所有与网络连接的人...
- No! - Anyone connected right now...

420
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,290
-不行  -都容易受到攻击
- No! - ...is vulnerable.

421
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,180
我们还有在线的用户  
We have users online.

422
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,550
我们不...我们要坚持住
We're not... we're staying up.

423
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:34,010
-开始攻击视差了  -天啊  太快了
- It's starting on "Parallax." - Christ, this thing is fast.

424
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,740
-第2章没了  -给唐娜打电话
- There goes chapter two. - Can somebody call Donna?

425
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,420
我们找不到她的号码
We couldn't find her number.

426
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,390
-什么  -哪里贴了张便条上有
- What? - It's on a Post-it somewhere.

427
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,750
天呐
Jesus.

428
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,890
你好  我找唐娜
Hi, can I speak to Donna?

429
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,040
什么  在哪啊
What? Where?

430
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,510
我是卡梅伦  她有留电话吗
It's Cameron. Did she leave a number?

431
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:00,900
听我说
Listen to me!

432
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,950
我得马上跟唐娜说话
I need to speak to Donna right away!

433
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,120
喂
Hello?

434
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,800
喂
Hello?

435
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,880
喂
Hello?

436
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,600
关掉
Shut it down.

437
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,510
整个网络吗
The whole network?

438
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,700
全部关掉
Everything, shut it all down.

439
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,130
或许你改变了他
Maybe you changed him.

440
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,110
他跟我前夫完全不同
No, he's nothing like my ex.

441
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,220
我以为你只喝啤酒呢
Thought you were strictly a beer guy.

442
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,760
我去年夏天喝了一瓶"桑希尔"
I had this bottle of "san-seer" at the mission last summer.

443
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,440
打开世界新大门了
It kind of rocked my world.

444
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,870
是桑塞尔
Sancerre.

445
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,130
桑管他妈的呢
Sans-who-gives-a-shit.

446
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,210
不错啊
That's good.

447
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,000
都值了  不是吗
It makes it all worthwhile, right?

448
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,720
是啊
Oh, yeah.

449
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,850
她现在忙得团团转
She's burning at both ends.

450
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,540
每天早上  我把她从沙发上抱下来
Every morning, I peel her off the couch,

451
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,680
安顿在床上
tuck her in.

452
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,950
算是轮到我主内了
My turn, I guess.

453
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,420
总之  你混得不错啊  很高兴见到你这样
Anyhow, you traded up. It's good to see you're doing so well.

454
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,530
你也不差
You, too.

455
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,640
你怎么没告诉我你被卡迪夫坑了
Why didn't you tell me you got screwed by Cardiff?

456
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,650
我觉得我能承受
Well, I thought I could live with it.

457
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,500
我会替你去找他的
Well, I'd have gone to him for you.

458
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,240
我虽然不会把自己的钱跟你分
I mean, I wouldn't have split my share or anything,

459
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,270
但至少也会替你说句话
but, you know, I would've spoken up.

460
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,190
我每天早上要去一间地下室上班
I report every morning to a basement.

461
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,840
我住在一间比我原来的房子不知小多少的公寓
I come home to an apartment that's smaller than my old bathroom.

462
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,380
但这样的生活
And yet if you offered me this version of my life

463
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,100
和你的分红
or your payout,

464
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,710
不管是多少  多少来着
whatever it was... how much was it?

465
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,160
83.81万美元
$838,100...

466
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,620
我会选择这个
I'd choose this.

467
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,840
我会选择她
I'd choose her.

468
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,630
-亲爱的  -嗯
- Honey? - Yeah?

469
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,100
抱歉  萝丝说穆特尼那边找我来着
Hey, I'm sorry. Rose says Mutiny's trying to reach me

470
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,910
我打过去  他们电话都占着线
and I called and their phone lines are all tied up.

471
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,460
我们该过去看看
I think we should head over there.

472
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,230
唐娜  问题严重吗
Oh, Donna, is it serious?

473
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,470
不  可能只是暴乱
No, it's probably just a riot,

474
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,100
大火  或巧克力糖吃多了
a massive fire, or a Goobers overdose.

475
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,630
乔  谢谢你今晚的招待
Joe, thank you for a lovely evening.

476
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:32,660
很高兴见到你
Well, it was good to see you.

477
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,670
抱歉要提前离开
Sorry we have to cut it short.

478
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,920
没事
It's okay.

479
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,000
慢慢喝桑塞尔吧
Enjoy the Sancerre.

480
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,530
莎拉  多谢邀请我们
Sara, thanks for having us.

481
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,440
天呐  我以为没完了呢
Oh, my God, I thought that would never end.

482
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,180
他跟她在一起做什么啊
What is he doing with her?

483
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,270
她又为什么跟他  你说呢
And vice versa, what do you think?

484
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,600
她是有救世主情节吗
She's got some sort of savior complex?

485
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,440
我不知道  我觉得她还蛮厉害的
I don't know. She seems impressive to me.

486
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,340
是啊  她父亲的大名肯定能提供不少机会
Yeah, well, I'm sure her father's name opens all kinds of doors.

487
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,750
乔很开心  也是个小奇迹了
Yeah, Joe's happy. Minor miracle.

488
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:03,120
当然了  他完全把她唬住了
Yeah, of course he is. He's got her completely snowed.

489
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,830
你今晚真美
Well, you look lovely tonight.

490
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,040
谢谢  老爸
Hey, uh, thank you, Pop.

491
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,980
现在大家都知道你坐在外面了
Now everyone knows you're out here.

492
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,530
你好吗  詹姆斯
How are you, James?

493
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,300
你出来之后不能打个电话吗
Couldn't have picked up a phone when you got out?

494
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,130
我想当面说
No, I wanted to say this in person.

495
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,810
天呐  开始了
Oh, jeez, here we go.

496
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,280
彩排晚宴很重要的
Look, the rehearsal dinner's a damn milestone,

497
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,710
坐好
so sit back...

498
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,490
闭上嘴
close your piehole.

499
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,770
有次圣诞节  我和詹姆斯妈妈看见他在屋顶上
"When his mother and I found James on the roof one Christmas,

500
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,910
拿着手电筒  准备了一堆问题  等着圣诞老人
waiting for Santa with a flashlight and a long list of questions,

501
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,990
我们就知道这孩子不怕挑战
we knew that our boy wasn't afraid of a challenge.

502
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,670
如今我们知道丽莎也是这样
And now we know Lisa isn't either."

503
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,050
-"此处应有笑声"  -真不错
- "Pause for laughter." - Oh, nice.

504
00:27:59,050 --> 00:27:59,910
好吧
Okay.

505
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:04,000
詹姆斯第一次在小联盟比赛上三振出局时
"When James got his first strikeout in Little League,

506
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,550
我去做销售了
I was on a sales call.

507
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,600
他高中毕业时
When he graduated from high school,

508
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,420
我去坦帕开会了
I was at a conference in Tampa.

509
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,520
我知道  有时候他会觉得
I know there are times when it felt like

510
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,860
爸爸就是早上摸摸他的头
his father was nothing but a head rub in the morning

511
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,360
晚上门口一闪而过的人影
and a shadow in the door at night.

512
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,210
但今晚不会
But not this night.

513
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,820
今晚不会
Not tonight."

514
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:37,160
我能看看吗  我想拿给丽莎看
May I see it? I'd really like to show Lisa.

515
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,970
我不知道妈妈怎么跟你说的
Look, I don't know what Mom told you,

516
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,390
但我不生你的气
but I'm not angry at you.

517
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,210
我之前是生气  现在不了
I was, but I'm not.

518
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,250
听说你娶的姑娘不错
I hear you got yourself a hell of a gal, huh?

519
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,240
是啊
Aw, yeah.

520
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,000
我会请你们...哪天请你们来做客
Well, I'll have you over to the... over some night,

521
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,180
等我安顿好了的
you know, when I settle in.

522
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,790
好啊
Sure thing.

523
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,500
好了  老婆等着呢
All righty, well, wife's awaitin'.

524
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,200
这说起来好别扭
It's gonna feel weird saying that.

525
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,680
我老婆
"My wife."

526
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,930
多说说就习惯了
Well, it gets easier.

527
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,030
你明天来吧
Why don't you come tomorrow?

528
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,440
让一个释放犯坐在前排吗
What, an ex-con in the front pew?

529
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,610
你妈妈会炸的
Oh, your mother'd combust, for God's sake.

530
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,670
丽莎不会介意的
Well, Lisa wouldn't mind.

531
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,080
我也不会
Neither would I.

532
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,520
改天吧
Some other time.

533
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,520
嗯
All right.

534
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,200
照顾好这台爷爷车
Take care of this old thing.

535
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,600
我们用户加载的所有碟片都会受感染
Every disk our subscribers load will be infected.

536
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,650
我们得彻底重启
We're gonna have to do a clean reboot,

537
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,480
让用户不要上网
tell our users to stay offline

538
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,290
直到...
until...

539
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,970
我们寄出新软盘吗
We mail out new floppies?

540
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,450
全部寄新的  我们所有的游戏
Of everything. Every game that we make.

541
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,980
还得为毁了他们的其他软件赔偿他们
And reimburse them for ruining their other software.

542
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,120
他们的数据可能全被灭了
Chances are they've suffered total data extinction

543
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,880
而且会怪罪我们的
and they're gonna blame us.

544
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,860
天知道这下我们要彻底损失多少用户了
God knows how many subscribers we've lost for good.

545
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,660
小点心和鸡尾酒还算美味吗
Did you enjoy your finger food and cocktails?

546
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,030
卡梅伦  怎么回事
Cameron, what is this? What's going on?

547
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,850
一个恶意程序毁了我们的硬盘
A rogue program ate our drives.

548
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,470
抹去了我们所有的数据

叫做索纳里斯
Something called Sonaris.

550
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,970
该死
Oh, shit.

551
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,020
你发送了
You sent it?

552
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,650
我...我们走之前
I... I mean, I... before we left...

553
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,550
等等  这是你写的
Stop. You wrote this?

554
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:07,050
不  我不知道他发送了
No, uh, I didn't know that he actually went ahead and sent it.

555
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,370
你不知道
You didn't know?

556
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,400
-你们是夫妻啊  -这什么意思...
- You're married to him. - What is that supposed...

557
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,910
我们是想帮你们找到所有实际用户
We were trying to help you map your network.

558
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,280
让我进去  我或许能帮忙
Look, let me in there, maybe I can help.

559
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,690
-你想帮我们  -对不起
- You want to help us? - I'm sorry, all right?

560
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,380
我给你们买点新硬盘
You know, I'll buy you some new drives.

561
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,300
关键不在于硬盘  混蛋
It's not the drives, asshole.

562
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,700
我们丢了游戏  原创游戏
We lost games. We lost original work.

563
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,370
不不  他根本不懂那个概念
No, no, no. He doesn't know what that is.

564
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,920
你不能别插手吗
You wouldn't just stay away?

565
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,580
你不能让我们做我们的吗
You couldn't just leave us to do our thing?

566
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,750
天呐  别那么自以为是了
Christ, get over yourself.

567
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,340
你讨厌我们的工作  因为它新奇  勇敢
I mean, which you hate because it's new and brave

568
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,540
而你只能站在外面往里看  你个卖身的
and because you're on the outside looking in, you sellout.

569
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,530
说话小心点
Watch your mouth.

570
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,470
而你老婆做的事
Meanwhile, your wife is doing things

571
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,000
你连想都想不出
that you couldn't even imagine.

572
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,360
-你还想把她扯进来吗  -戈登
- You want to bring her into this? - Okay. Gordon.

573
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,010
-你的租约谁签的  -戈登
- Who signs your lease? - Gordon!

574
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,370
你们的水电费谁偷偷付的
Who pays your water and electric behind your back?

575
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:51,700
你们还存在都是亏了唐娜
You know? Donna's the whole reason you haven't been condemned!

576
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,980
你肯定不知道  是吧
Bet you didn't know that, did you?

577
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,350
还有你  你  还有你  天才小丫头
Or you or you or you, Little Miss Girl Genius.

578
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,870
-这叫公司吗  -亲爱的
- You call this a company? - Honey...

579
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:04,460
是"呆子街噩梦"差不多
This is more like "Nightmare on Nerd Street"!

580
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,620
-亲爱的  -什么
- Hey, honey. - What?

581
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,600
你回家吧
Would you go home?

582
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,140
-唐娜  -回家吧  求你
- Donna. - Just go home, please.

583
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,490
先生
Sir.

584
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,420
那不是你的车啊
That's not your car.

585
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,160
有两台XT在运行
We've got two XTs up and running,

586
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,450
但游戏还断着线
but games are still down,

587
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,550
社区也是
Community, too.

588
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,060
我们得从备份恢复系统  彻底重装
We'll have to do a complete reinstall from backups.

589
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,910
你要我再道一次歉吗
Do you want me to apologize again?

590
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,730
这事我也很难过  我们是合伙人
This hurts me, too. We're partners.

591
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,130
得了
Please.

592
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,320
这是你的工作  唐娜  但是我的生活
This is your job, Donna, but it's my life.

593
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,850
我住这里  也就是说  我得一直
I live here, which means I'm always gonna catch

594
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,950
在这里面对此时此刻出现的麻烦
the shit that has to be dealt with right now

595
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,610
而你则在家里做冰棍
while you're at home making popsicles

596
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,190
-遛狗  -我们没养狗
- and walking the dog... - We don't have a dog.

597
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,530
或者让外人毁了我们的生意
...or letting an outside party liquefy our business.

598
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:24,830
而我都在这儿
I'm here.

599
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,710
你为什么没告诉我你要跟乔·麦克米伦吃饭
Why didn't you tell me you were having dinner with Joe MacMillan?

600
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,520
我觉得你会为此生我气的
Well, I was pretty sure you'd hold it against me.

601
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,100
答对有奖
Ding, give the lady a prize.

602
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,830
-只是一顿饭而已  -回你丈夫身边去吧
- It was just dinner. - Go home to your husband.

603
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:56,940
还有  唐娜
Oh, and, Donna.

604
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,380
你再背着我  偷偷用自己的钱
If you ever put another dime of your own money into Mutiny again

605
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,680
给穆特尼垫费  你就被解雇了
behind my back, you're fired.

606
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,090
-要我送你回家吗  -不了  谢谢
- You want a ride? - No, thanks.

607
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,030
我能做什么
What can I do?

608
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,910
{\pos(259.2,91.454)}在线用户

610
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,500
{\pos(201.3,73.403)}视差                     坦克大战

611
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,210
-卡梅伦  -等一下
- Hey, uh, Cameron? - Huh? Oh, just give me a second.

612
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,970
好了  卡梅伦  呼吸
Okay, Cameron, just breathe, okay?

613
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,290
-我在呼吸  -没事的
- I am breathing. - Okay, hey.

614
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,540
卡梅伦  呼吸  过来
Cameron, breathe. Come here, come here.

615
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,030
过来  坐下
Come here. Come here. Sit down.

616
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:10,030
就点头或摇头  好吗  需要我叫医生吗
Just nod or shake your head, okay? Should I call a doctor?

617
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,660
你用什么药了吗
Okay, are you on any medication?

618
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,460
捏  再用力点  很好
Squeeze, squeeze. Harder, harder... good.

619
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,720
视差
"Parallax."

620
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,700
第3章  第7关  四巫师洞穴
Chapter three, level seven. The cave of the four wizards.

621
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,320
-你怎么...听我说  -什么
- How do you... focus. - What?

622
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,280
怎么把龙蛋带过峡谷
How do you get the dragon's egg across the chasm?

623
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,910
-什么  -如果你跳
- What... - 'Cause if you jump,

624
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,160
蛋会掉  对吧  有条绳索桥
you're gonna drop it, right? And there's a rope bridge.

625
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,150
但拿着蛋  你就过重了
But with the egg, you're too heavy.

626
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,520
卡梅伦  怎么办
So, Cameron, what do you do?

627
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,180
不知道  退回去
I don't know. You go back.

628
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,140
没错  退回去
That's right, that's right. You go back.

629
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,190
退回去  转身  回到洞穴里
You go back. You turn around, you go back inside,

630
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,730
面对第四名巫师
and you face the fourth wizard.

631
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:39,980
对吧
Right?

632
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,420
只有把蛋在他胸口上砸开
And then only by cracking the egg in his chest

633
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,190
才能让他重新变成人
can you make him human again.

634
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,510
好
Okay.

635
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,700
这就是我怀念视差的地方
That's what I'm gonna miss about "Parallax."

636
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,380
最初的那几章
Those early chapters,

637
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,210
每个陷阱都有奖赏
how every trap had a reward,

638
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,260
每个出口其实都是入口
every exit was actually an entrance.

639
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,580
让我觉得像《绿野仙踪》一样
You know, the whole thing made me feel like "The Wizard of Oz."

640
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,900
但还要更好  因为你
But it was better because you were really like...

641
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,320
像是进入了电影里
like inside the movie, you know?

642
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:09,940
驾驭气球  跑过罂粟田
Running those balloons, running through those poppy fields?

643
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,170
感觉像真的一样
It was like it was real.

644
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,030
我要放手了
I'm gonna let go, okay?

645
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,190
嗯
Yeah.

646
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,620
我去给你拿点水
I'm gonna get you some water.

647
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,360
别走开  好吗
Don't go anywhere, okay?

648
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,190
有多严重
How bad is it?

649
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,300
很严重
It's bad.

650
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,340
我该多测试几次的
I should've tested it more.

651
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:35,160
我...我一激动起来就...
I just... I got excited or...

652
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,870
我也说不好  我该告诉你的
I don't know. I should have told you.

653
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,890
不
No.

654
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,840
是我没管
No, I let it happen.

655
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,990
我没阻止你
I didn't stop you.

656
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,320
究竟是什么问题
What exactly was the issue?

657
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,830
对不起
Oh, sorry.

658
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,860
嗯  我也想搞明白呢
Well, that's what I'm trying to find out.

659
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:26,480
嗯  等等
Yeah, hold on. Hold on.

660
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,700
等等
Hold on.

661
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,750
早啊
Morning.

662
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,980
真有意思
Boy, that's funny. Yeah.

663
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,340
去主机室见我
Meet me in the mainframe room.

664
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,820
-我就好了  -马上
- I'm almost done. - Now.

665
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,950
这些机器
These machines.

666
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,890
跟我们一样上下班
They work the same shift as us.

667
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,640
是啊  朝九晚五  怎么了
Yep, 9:00 to 5:00. Why?

668
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,340
价值数百万的机器
Millions of dollars of hardware

669
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,750
每天闲坐16个小时
sitting unused for 16 hours a day.

670
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,800
到底什么事
What's this about?

671
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,820
是突破口
A way in.

672
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,980
-什么  -没事了
- What? - Never mind.

673
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,130
那我回去工作了
Back to work, then?

674
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,430
是  先生
Yes, sir.

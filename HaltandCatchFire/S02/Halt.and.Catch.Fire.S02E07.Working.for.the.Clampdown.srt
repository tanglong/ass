00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,420
我想先听他说完
So, I'm thinking that we'll listen to him, hear him out,

146
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,850
然后表现得专业点  委婉地拒绝他  好吧
and then act professional and then just let him down easy, right?

147
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,630
-我得请段时间的假  -现在吗
- I'm gonna need some time off. - Now?

你没事吧

150
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,890
就是
It's, uh--

151
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,760
可以谈了吗
We ready to talk?

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,070
老天爷
Jesus.

153
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,690
-就这样了吗  -不是
- So that's it, huh? - No.

154
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,400
这只是些数字
Those are just the numbers.

155
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,950
还有别的东西
Here are some others.

清单如下  31台康懋达64电脑

163
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,420
我的意思是  你不在意数字
My point is, you don't care about numbers.

164
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,530
你也不该在意
You shouldn't.

165
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,730
这地方的特别之处
What makes this place special is

166
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,320
是人们分享食谱  建议
people sharing recipes, advice,

167
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,090
生活经历  交流

168
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,960
只需要一根电话线
over the speed of a phone line.

169
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,810
穆特尼的王牌不是游戏  而是人
Mutiny's killer app isn't games, it's people.

170
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,030
你如果和我们签约

171

你就不需要担心数字了
you won't have to worry about numbers anymore.

172
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,330
而是让我们处理那部分
You can let us handle that part

173
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,450
这样你就能专注于你爱做的
so you can focus on what you love,

174
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,700
也就是将人们聚集到一起

175
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,400
我们不想削减游戏开发
We're not interested in minimizing games.

176
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,470
我也不想
Neither am I.

177
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,110
游戏是这个公司的创新命脉

178

对于技术突破至关重要

179
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,570
对于带来新用户举足轻重

180
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,450
但他们加入后
But once they've arrived,

181
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,660
交流就比游戏内容更重要了
connection trumps content.

182
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,770
从第一天起  西方集团将开始
Starting day one, Westgroup will begin

183
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,940
把你们的网络拓展到全球
a global expansion of your network.

184
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,480
也就是说可以触及无数
That means reaching thousands and thousands

185
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,470
遍布全球的独立用户
of isolated users all over the world

186
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,080
让他们一下子觉得不那么孤单了
and suddenly making them feel less alone.

187
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,340
那么  具体点说
Uh, just to talk specifics,

188
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,000
全球拓展到底是什么样的
what exactly would global expansion look like?

189
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,160
我们不感兴趣
We're not interested.

190
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,840
我觉得  我们该花点时间想想
I think...I think we should take a minute with this.

191
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,600
我想了
I have.

192
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,410
也许我疯了  但在我听来
Maybe I'm crazy, but it sounds to me

193
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,930
西方集团似乎想做我们也想做的事
like Westgroup wants the exact same things that we do.

194
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,220
我也还没被说服
I'm not sold yet either,

195
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,290
但我觉得我们该听听看
but I think we should hear this out.

196
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,570
我们放下过去吧
Let's leave the past where it is

197
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,660
一起创造点真正特别的东西
and build something truly special together.

198
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,840
不  当我没说
No, scratch that.

199
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,890
是你来创造
You build it.

200
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,190
这次我不会妨碍你了
I'll get out of the way this time.

201
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,430
你不会妨碍我吗
You'll get out of the way?

202
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,030
所有人  听好了
Everybody, listen up.

203
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,830
-卡梅伦  别这样  -事情是这样的
- Cameron, come on. - Here's what's going on.

204
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,720
乔·麦克米伦和西方集团能源想收购我们
Joe MacMillan and Westgroup Energy want to buy us up.

205
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,980
听到了吗  就是这样
You hear that? Yeah.

206
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,410
我们都能去市中心为石油公司大佬打工了
We can all go work for a bunch of oil company suits downtown.

207
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,630
这听上去如何
How's that sound to you guys?

208
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,500
怎么  听上去像是出卖自己吧
Oh, what, does it sound like selling out?

209
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,150
-没错  -因为我就是这感觉
- Yeah. - 'Cause that's what it sounds like to me.

210
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,560
没错  不是去设计酷炫游戏
Yeah, instead of building kick-ass games,

211
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,680
他们想让这里变成
they want to turn this into a place

212
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,970
家庭主妇能分享食谱的地方
where housewives can share their recipes.

213
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:49,990
蠢爆了
That's bullshit!

214
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,200
什么  等等  你不想打领带上班啊
What? Oh, wait, you don't want to wear a tie to work?

215
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,640
不想打卡上下班啊
You don't want to clock in and out?

216
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,340
-才不要  -那么你们宁可做平等的伙伴
- No. Hell, no. - So you'd rather be equal partners

217
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,170
一起打造你们用血汗
in a thing that you created

218
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,950
和泪水创造的东西
with your own blood and sweat and tears

219
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,020
而不是做企业食物链里没主见的小丑吗
than mindless stooges in a corporate food chain?

220
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,090
对

在假期中抽出时间

226
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,590
一起来尝试这个点子
so we can try this thing out, all right?

227
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,120
我不要求你们马上全部入股
I'm not asking for full buy-in now.

228
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,080
我相信空谈不如实践
I believe the proof is in the pudding.

229
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,470
等到了时候  如果你们想入股就买入
Once those days are up, if you want in, you're in.

That's a lot of salary to walk away from after a couple of weeks.

232
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,290
没错  我了解
Yeah, yeah. I know it is.

都把最近一张工资单带来

235
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,390
我好开出对等的酬劳

236
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,210
听着  我还不能马上分发停车位
Look, I'm not handing out parking spaces

237
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,600

坐在工作台前  做最擅长的工作
sitting at these benches, doing what they do best.

00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,370
我就在全国最大的电脑杂志上登广告

244
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,440

呼叫乔·麦克米伦
Paging Joe MacMillan.

We'll standardize around the Intel 186 '87 processor

247

Eventually, we'll go to 12 MHz on the 286-based system,

250
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,260
但现在我想继续使用186架构的处理器
but for now I want to stick with the 186

251
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,960
好控制价格
so we can keep prices down.

252
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,920
你们可能想问  低到多少

253

每台八百块上下

254
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,200
取决于顾客的选择

这才是"开放式架构"

我们制造的每台机器的命运

都掌握在开启开关的用户手里

想一起大干一场吗
You guys want to slam one of these together or what?

268
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,140
这不是死刑  只是个麻烦
It's not a death sentence, it's a complication.

269
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,790
天晓得我们克服过不少麻烦了
And Lord knows the two of us have overcome our fair share of those.

270
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,810
怎么了

271
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,360
对不起  甜心  我还在想"脑损伤"
I'm sorry, honey. I'm still on "brain damage."

272
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,130
只是局部  只有一些轻微影响

273
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,040

肌肉无力  记忆缺失

他可能偶尔会有点不在状态

Like when he dug a hole in your yard in the middle of the night?

277
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:07,320
不不  那是工作压力导致的
No, no, that was work, stress.

278
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,270
多年前戈登飞来这里
What about when Gordon flew out here all those years ago

279
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,570
请求你父亲允许你嫁给他那次呢
to ask your father's permission to marry you?

280
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,310
-那是怎么回事  -妈妈  你这就无理取闹了
- What happened? - No, Mom-- now you're being ridiculous.

281
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,590
-那是怎么回事  唐娜  -妈妈
- What happened, Donna? - Mom.

282
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:22,090
他紧张到上错了飞机
He was so nervous that he got on the wrong plane.

283
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,550
结果飞到了盐湖城
Ended up in Salt Lake City.

284
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,110
不得不打电话找你爸爸帮他订了机票
Had to call your father, who ended up booking him a seat.

285
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,310
你爸还让登机口检票员确认他上对了飞机
Even told the gate agent to make sure he got on the right flight.

286
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,900
那不是  那挺可爱的
That's not-- that's-- it's cute.

287
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,030
那是
It's-- that's--

288
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,800
天呐  妈妈  那是我最喜欢的戈登的趣事之一
Jesus, Mom, that's one of my favorite stories about Gordon.

289
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,370
跟这个没关系
that has nothing to do with this.

290
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,730
万一病情恶化了呢
What if he gets worse?

291
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,250
万一他哪天坐轮椅了呢
What if one day he's in a wheelchair?

292
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,310
那时候怎么办
What then?

293
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,570
到那时我们再想办法
Well, then we will deal with it.

294
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,620
万一他照顾孩子的时候
What if something happens

295
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,700
出了什么意外呢  宝贝
when he's taking care of the girls, honey?

296
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,070
你考虑过这个吗
Have you thought of that?

297
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,020
我知道这不容易  但你得考虑啊
I know it's hard, but you have to.

298
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,250
或许之前
Maybe what happened--

299
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,440
那个孩子
the baby--

300
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,220
焉知非福
was a blessing in disguise.

301
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,930
你们什么情况了啊
Hey, how's it going over here?

302
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,630
就那样咯
Whatever, whatever.

303
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,950
你打算什么时候跟他见面
What, when are you gonna meet up with this guy?

304
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,100
-他叫乔治  是吧  -我也说不好
- George, right? - I don't know.

305
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,920
我们说要明天一起做点什么
We talked about doing something tomorrow,

306
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,270
但也可能不成
but maybe never.

307
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:30,160
莱夫  去吧  别怂了
Lev, do it. Stop being such a wuss.

308
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,470
闭嘴  你还欠我一个黑色蜘蛛侠
Shut up. You still owe me a black Spider-Man.

309
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,310
弄好了
I think I got it.

310
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,750
好啊  去看看
All right, let's go.

311
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,380
出价在哪
Where's how much it was for?

312
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,590
还没找到  你们看
I haven't found it yet, but look.

313
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,450
办公区翻修并扩张
Office space renovation and expansion,

314
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,880
-等等...  -卡梅伦拥有90%的穆特尼吗
- something-something... - Cameron owns 90% of this place?

315
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,750
普通创始员工
Founding entry-level employees

316
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,670
享有现工资64%的加薪
entitled to a 64% increase of current salary

317
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,780
及出售价1%的提成
and 1% of sale price.

318
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,890
多少的1%
1% of what?

319
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:17,550
我们已经拒绝了  所以是零蛋的1%
Well, we already said no, so it's 1% of jack shit.

320
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,150
先说清楚
Let's be clear.

321
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,570
不是你叫我来的  是别人选派我来的
You didn't bring me here. I elected to show up.

322
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,610
你在这间房里说的话卡梅伦都会知道
Everything you say in this room goes right back to Cameron.

323
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,670
而且我确信
And I have every expectation

324
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,610
卡梅伦知道你来见我
that Cameron knows you came to see me.

325
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,810
你明白这项交易很好
You know this is a good deal.

326
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:38,930
条款还算合理  但这不是我的公司
The terms are not insulting, yeah, but it ain't my company.

327
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,160
她对此有意见也算正常  你说是吧
Can't fault the kid for being a little squirrely, either, can you?

328
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,480
乔啊
Hell, Joe,

329
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,070
我当初还觉得你这人挺靠谱呢
you seemed like a pretty good deal to me back in the day.

330
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,180
我可没叫你挪用那笔钱啊  约翰
I never asked you to embezzle that money, John.

331
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,670
如果你不是决定自己采取行动
If you hadn't taken matters into your own hands

332
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,600
而是听了我的话
and instead just listened to me,

333
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,580
你现在就跟内森一样是百万富翁了
you'd be a multimillionaire along with Nathan right now.

334
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,570
你清楚这点  你是个明白人
I know you see it. You always have.

335
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,950
你全力支持巨人  因为你看好它
You went to bat for the Giant because you believed in it.

336
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,010
你加入穆特尼  因为你看好他们做的事
You're at Mutiny because you believe in what they're doing now.

337
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:09,270
去穆特尼是因为我55岁有案底  找不到工作
I'm at Mutiny because I'm a 55-year-old ex-con who can't get a job.

338
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,260
你可是很有价值的人才啊
You're an extremely valuable asset.

339
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,700
得了吧  乔
Please, Joe.

340
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,810
这么强的阳光照在我屁股上  我受不了
I can't take such a large amount of sunshine up my ass.

341
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,450
痒得慌
It makes me itch.

342
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,760
我们得把这个项目
We're going to need to pitch this program

343
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,580
推销给全球9个不同的子公司
to nine different global subsidiaries.

344
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,190
这很考验销售才智
That's gonna require serious sales acumen.

345
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,580
我们希望你加入这个团队
We want you on that team.

346
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,390
你们
We?

347
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,370
除非她奇迹般改变心意
Man, you're not pitching shit

348
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,910
你们什么都推销不了
unless she miraculously changes her mind,

349
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,560
除非她另有安排  我都会一直在她的厨房干活儿
and I work out of her kitchen until the day she says otherwise.

350
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,460
你是该坐角落办公室的人
You belong in a corner office.

351
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,860
我们这儿就有一间等着你呢
and we've got one waiting for you right here.

352
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,530
你在卡梅伦那边说得上话
You have Cameron's ear.

353
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,440
她可以随便恨我
She can hate me all she wants,

354
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,000
但别让她为赌气就放弃好机会
but don't let her cut off her nose to spite her face.

355
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,570
我知道她看重你的意见
I know you're her go-to.

356
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,090
不是我
It ain't me, babe.

357
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,210
那是唐娜吗
Is it Donna, then?

358
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,750
我能说什么
What can I say?

359
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,380
那孩子恋爱了
The kid's in love.

360
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:09,730
雅各布
Oh, Jacob.

361
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,100
真高兴你能来
So glad you could swing by.

362
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,170
约翰·博斯沃思
John Bosworth.

363
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,870
-久仰大名了  -过奖
- I've been hearing about you in my circles for years. - Sure.

364
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,180
我真的很期待
I'm really looking forward to

365
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,550
有你这样的资历和背景的人加入这个团队
having someone of your background and experience on this team.

366
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,380
相信我们都可以从彼此身上
I'm sure we both can learn a thing or two

367
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,780
学习到一些东西  你说呢
from each other, don't you think?

368
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,680
当然了  我完全同意
Oh, I think so. I think so.

369
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,010
-谢谢  -抱歉这么来去匆匆的
- Thank you. - Look, I'm sorry to be in and out like this.

370
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,850
我4点要赶去休斯顿
I have to be in Houston by 4:00,

371
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,520
但我听说你要来
but when I heard that you were coming in,

372
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:33,530
当然得亲自过来
I just had to come over and

373
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,350
-自我介绍一下  -当然  当然
- introduce myself personally. - Oh, sure, sure.

374
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,040
-真的很荣幸  -我也很荣幸  雅各布
- It's a real pleasure. - Pleasure's mine, Jacob, yeah.

375
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,850
失陪
Joe.

376
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,880
你知道
You know...

377
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,070
你在别处可找不到这么好的买卖
you're not gonna find a deal like this anywhere else.

378
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,110
你也许是对的
You might be right.

379
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,820
但我不会被你收买  乔
But I won't be bought, Joe.

380
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:03,290
如果这是卡梅伦的意愿  那我们都不会
And if that's what Cameron wants, none of us will.

381
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,120
但我们可以提供3.5软盘供客户选择
But we can offer an option for a micro 3 1/2.

382
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,490
单面还是双面
Single or double-sided?

383
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,130
都有  但是双面更贵
Offer both, but double costs more.

384
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:26,970
你不用整天都待在这儿
Hey, you don't have to hang out here all day, you know.

385
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,580
你知道这事有一阵子了  但我才刚刚知道
Look, you've been living with this for a while. I haven't.

386
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,470
而且不只是因为你的病
But, look, it's more than that.

387
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,410
我离开太久了  我想你
I've been gone too long. I've missed you.

388
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,230
我也想你
I've missed you, too.

389
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,810
-我知道这才是你去亨利家的原因  -什么
- I know that's why you went to Henry's. - What?

390
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,850
你需要有人陪着你  因为我没在
You needed someone else because I wasn't there for you.

391
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,390
你现在在了
Well, you're here now.

392
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,820
-戈登  -怎么了
- Hey, Gordon? - Yeah?

393
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,360
-马克杯放哪了  -水槽左边
- Where do you keep the mugs? - Left of the sink.

394
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,820
要我帮你新煮一壶咖啡吗
Want me to make you a new pot?

395
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,130
其实是拿去装小螺钉的
Oh, it's actually for smaller screws.

396
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,330
很小很小的那种
Tiny, tiny stuff.

397
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,610
-工作顺利吗  -好极了
- How's everything going out there? - Great.

398
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,950
设计原型机参数  研究改进主机
Laying out the prototype specs, digging in on mods.

399
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,080
戈登做得怎么样
How's Gordon handling everything?

400
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,660
他刚电话订购了四万美元的CPU芯片
He just bought 40 grand worth of CPU chips over the damn phone,

401
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,910
要我说  挺不错的
so I'd say pretty good.

402
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,400
-四万美元  -是啊
- $40,000? - Yeah.

403
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,510
你觉得这没问题吗
Does that seem okay to you?

404
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,900
怎么了  有问题吗
Why, is something wrong?

405
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,620
不不  没事
No, no, nothing.

406
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,470
盯着他点
Just, could you keep an eye on him

407
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,180
如果他看起来不对劲...
and let me know if he seems...

408
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,480
就告诉我
different, you know, or...

409
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,630
好  没问题
Sure, will do.

410
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,110
拉里  磨磨蹭蹭干吗呢
Larry, what's the holdup?

411
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,570
你在勾搭我老婆吗
You puttin' the moves on my wife?

412
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,170
没有
Uh, no, sir.

413
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,620
我们还有正事呢
We got work to do.

414
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,010
-你去我家了  -我以为能找到你
- You went to my house? - I thought I'd try you there.

415
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,920
你不在家  所以我留下了...
You weren't home, so I left the--

416
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,690
条款清单  你知道我那会儿在上班
The terms sheet, yeah. You knew I'd be at work.

417
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,440
你知道谁在我家吗
Do you know who was at my house?

418
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,640
我妈妈
My mother.

419
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,370
她以为我会因为出售
Do you know she cried when she thought

420
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,320
而挣这么多钱的时候都哭了
I was getting this kind of a payout from the sale?

421
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,930
当我不得不告诉她
And then she cried again

422
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,810
并不是她想的那样时  她又哭了
when I had to tell her that it wasn't true.

423
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:13,100
你懂不懂跟她那样的人
Do you-- do you understand the recklessness

424
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,100
撒那种谎是多么欠考虑
of telling those kinds of lies to someone like that?

425
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,740
我才没说谎  钱数是真的
Who's lying? These numbers are real.

426
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,410
给你的价格和卡梅伦
That's the same acquisition offer

427
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,860
还有高级员工是一样的
tendered to Cameron and the senior staff.

428
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,520
唯一新加的数据
The only new piece of accounting here

429
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,720
是你个人能挣多少钱
is what you would personally stand to make.

430
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,400
-就是贿赂我  -我只是替你算好了
- A bribe, you mean. - I just did the math for you.

431
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,700
汤姆
You know, Tom,

432
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,700
这些话你可以在电话上说的
you could've told me all this over the phone.

433
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,280
但你却亲自来了
And yet you're here.

434
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,960
你闯进了我家  我想回敬你
You invaded my space, I figured I'd invade yours.

435
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,880
你关心卡梅伦
You care about Cameron.

436
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,600
你是该关心她  她很特别
You should. She's special.

437
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,740
但你要想想  如果让她纯粹出于感情用事
But you have to ask yourself if you're doing right by her

438
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,290
而做出这个决定  是不是真正为她好
if you let her make this decision from a place of pure emotion.

439
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,690
我不会告诉她我们谈过话
I'm not even gonna tell her that we spoke.

440
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:05,890
好吧
Okay.

441
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,350
他只和我说了这些
That's all that he told me.

442
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,290
这是你想要的吗
Is that what you want?

443
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,650
你觉得上面写的是多少钱
How much do you think it was for?

444
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,460
不知道
I don't know.

445
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,030
是五百万
It was five million.

446
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,630
但我们已经做出了决定
But we already made our decision,

447
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:59,330
所以回去工作  把这事忘了吧  好吗
so let's get back to work and just forget about it, okay?

448
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,430
不
No.

449
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,920
你替我们做了决定
You made our decision.

450
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,200
民主哪去了
What happened to democracy?

451
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,610
你忘了吗
Maybe your memory's failing you,

452
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,160
我们一起大喊着把乔赶出去了
but we all shouted Joe out of this house.

453
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,630
难道不是我们共同的决定吗
Didn't we all make this call?

454
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,470
是的  说实话我们只是好奇而已
Yeah, honestly, we were just curious, that's all.

455
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:17,290
-没关系  就这样了  -没什么
- Yeah, it's okay. Cool, so it's settled. - It's fine.

456
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,660
你为什么从没告诉我们你拥有90%的穆特尼
How come you never told us you own 90% of Mutiny?

457
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,790
你不要再想这事了
You need to let this go right now.

458
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,680
我们怎么还能有任何话语权
How could anything be up to us at all?

459
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,270
而且这事不一样吧
And shouldn't this be different?

460
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,530
我们不知道合同的细节
We didn't know the details of the deal

461
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:34,120
也不知道我们拒绝了五百万美元
or that we were turning our backs on $5 million.

462
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,640
怎么了  你想要什么
What? What do you want?

Yes, fine. We'll have a vote.

467
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,920
为了你  好让这事过去
For you, so that we can put this to bed.

468

大家都进来
Everyone come in here.

469
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,370

卖
Sell.

471
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,560

我能弃权吗
Can I abstain?

476
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,320
好吧  不卖
Okay, not sell.

477
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,720

Well?

00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,870
不卖
Not sell.

482
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,730
汤姆

穆特尼
Mutiny.

484
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,320
汤姆
Tom?

00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,030
天呐

莱夫进医院了
Lev's in the hospital.

488
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,360
你在等什么
What are you waiting for?

489
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,500
我知道在我父亲眼中
I know my father has this idea of me

490
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,850
我是个受伤的小姑娘  维持不住恋情
as some damaged little girl unable to keep a relationship.

491
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,330
我不是很想证明他是对的
I'm not exactly eager to prove him right.

492
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,660
-那就别啊  -行了
- Then don't. - Oh, please,

493
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,270
别让我更加为难
don't make this harder than it already is.

494
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,850
你们聊得好热闹啊
This is a scintillating conversation.

爸爸  乔和我
Dad, uh, Joe and I--

496
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,410
我在达拉斯过得并不开心
well, I haven't been exactly happy in Dallas.

497
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,840
对我  对我们来说很不好过
It's been hard on me, on us,

498
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,860
上周末  我去了奥斯汀  我就想...
and last weekend I was in Austin and I was thinking that--

499
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,010
不不  我懂
No, no, no, no, I understand.

500
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,220
这里对你们来说都很陌生
Things here are new for both of you.

501
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,860
新工作  新家  新城市
New job, new home, new city.

502
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,780
是否完美呢  现在还不  但你们在打基础
Is it perfect yet? No, but you're building a foundation.

503
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,660
我不是那个意思
Well, that's not what I mean.

504
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,090
我的意思是  你一向不善于
Well, what I mean is that you were never very good

505
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,030
静观其变
at sitting still for anything.

506

你不是每次有点不舒服了
You know, you don't need to hit the reset button

507
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,780
就非得重新来过
every time you feel the slightest bit of discomfort.

508
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,050
我不是那样的
That's not what I do.

509
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,230
-如果你说的是彼得  -得了  莎拉
- And if you're referring to Peter-- - Oh, come on, Sara.

510
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,640
-你就是这样的  -好吧
- It's exactly what you do. - Okay.

511
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,850
我在九个国家有生意
I do business in nine different countries,

512
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:19,680
但跟你比  我简直是千年老树
but compared to you, I feel like a thousand-year-old oak tree.

513
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,630
你终于找到个你能信任的人
You've finally found a guy you can trust,

514
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,320
能帮你治愈旧伤的人
someone who can help you heal those old wounds.

515
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,870
老实说  我很高兴你跟乔在一起了
Frankly, I'm delighted that you're with Joe.

516
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,840
就现在我觉得你都更脚踏实地了
Even right now, you seem much more grounded to me.

517
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,640
我不希望你们俩
Look, I hate to see both of you

518
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,110
丢弃你们在这里构建的一切
throw away everything you've been building here

519
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:40,600
就因为你一时感到不安
just because of some anxious whimsy on your part

520
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,550
而且追根溯源是由于你在前夫身上犯的错
stemming from the mistakes you made with your ex-husband.

521
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,610
恕我直言  雅各布
With all due respect, Jacob,

522
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,620
我觉得你说得并不对
I don't think you know what you're talking about.

523
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,740
你不该这么看轻莎拉
Sara deserves a little more credit than that.

524
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,520
她看到人的闪光点
She sees the best in people.

525
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,380
这不是弱点  这是她的强项
That's not a weakness, it's her strength.

526
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,480
抱歉
I'm sorry.

527
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,870
你觉得你比我还了解我女儿吗
You think you know my daughter better than I do?

528
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,980
我觉得我们的婚事不需要你来插手
I think we can navigate our engagement without your input.

529
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,020
有人想知道我是怎么想的吗
Does anybody want to know what I think?

530
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,410
-胜败在此一举了  -是啊
- Moment of truth. - Moment of truth.

531
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,630
好了
All right.

The Pro took us half a year.

而这东西我们两天就搭建好了
We got this sucker running in two days.

537
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,420
且不说别的  我们快多了
If nothing else, we're getting a lot faster.

538
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,780
我觉得我们很快都要富多了
I think pretty soon we're all gonna be a whole lot richer.

You all right, Gordon?

人生中最困难的事就是被击倒之后
the hardest thing in life is to get knocked down

再一次次站起来
and then get back up constantly.

但我们这么做是出于热爱
But we do it because we love it

545

我们内心知道  这点子是对的
and we know deep down that if it's the right idea,

00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,180
可以成就比我们都伟大的事
it could be bigger than all of us.

很久以来  我不确定自己是否有这份信念
For a long time, I wondered if I was ever gonna find it.

00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,520
我觉得
Well...

550
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,670
我终于有一样东西
I think I've finally found something

551
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,460
能让我
that will allow me

552
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,980
自信地跟他们说
to say to them with confidence,

553
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:30,880
"你可以的  你可以追随梦想
"You can do it. You can follow your dreams.

554
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,830
不管多么艰难  你可以做到的"
No matter how hard it is, you can do it."

555
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,930
说得好
Hear, hear.

556
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,390
-干杯  -敬梦想  戈登
- Cheers... - To dreams, Gordon.

557
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,950
就两周前
Just two weeks ago,

558
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,810
我还想走进乔的办公室
I was ready to walk into Joe's office

559
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:57,840
告诉他  15磅以下的便携电脑
and tell him that a portable under 15 pounds--

560
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,700
是不可能做到的
it couldn't be done.

561
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,610
现在  巨人将是市面上最轻的电脑
And now the Giant is gonna be the lightest machine on the market.

562
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:13,140
这太值得骄傲了
And that is truly something to be proud of.

563
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:18,220
乔...麦克米伦吗
Joe as in Joe MacMillan?

564
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,260
什么
Uh, what?

565
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,530
乔怎么了
What about Joe?

566
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,510
总之
Um, anyways, uh...

567
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,380
大家做得好
great-- great work, guys.

568
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,880
冷静  他稳定下来了  没事的
Easy, easy. He's stable. It's fine.

569
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,630
他现在还不能说话
He can't talk right now.

570
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,360
他在睡觉  他们要他休息
He's asleep and they want him to rest.

571
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,570
怎么回事
What happened?

572
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,550
他本来约好
He was supposed to go out

573
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,330
今天跟网上认识的乔治约会
with George today from the network.

574
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,730
他们被打劫了吗
Did they get jumped?

575
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,260
根本没有乔治
There is no George.

576
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,490
就是几个男的
It was just a bunch of guys

577
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,450
在社区上假装是一个人
pretending to be a person on Community

578
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,340
好把他引出去
so that they could lure him out and...

579
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,160
你把用户的订阅信息给警方了吗
Did you give the police the subscriber info for the accoun

580
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,990
-那样应该就能...  -不  地址是假的
- that should help them-- - No, the address is phony, so...

581
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,450
而且这些蠢猪
of course the dumb pigs

582
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,870
本来也没采取什么行动
aren't even doing anything about it, especially--

583
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,830
我能见见他吗
Um, can I see him?

584
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,540
怎么
So, what?

585
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,390
下周再来这里吃晚饭  到时告诉他吗
Dinner here again next week? We tell him then?

586
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,470
刚刚在里面听你俩讲话
You know, listening to the two of you talk in there,

587
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,030
让我全看明白了
it all crystalized for me.

588
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,700
问题就在这里  你再次回到达拉斯
This is what's wrong. You're in Dallas again,

589
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,700
去西方集团工作  秘密搭建网络
working at Westgroup, with a network that you set up in secret--

590
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,940
我觉得你不告诉他
I think you didn't tell him

591
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,550
是因为你还不想放弃
'cause you're not ready to give up on this.

592
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,680
不  我们从天文馆下山的时候
No, when we came down from the observatory,

593
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,640
我们说过要向前看
we talked about moving forward,

594
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,650
但你现在的样子  你现在的趋势
but the way you're acting now, where you're headed,

595
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,970
你是在后退  这不是我们说好的
you're backsliding, and I didn't sign up for that.

596
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,580
我不知道你要我改变哪一点
I don't know what you want me to do differently.

597
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,560
我要你别再插手别人的公司
I want you to stop meddling in other people's companies

598
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,930
去建个自己的
and build your own.

599
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,910
像我们说好那样  去别的地方
Somewhere else, like we talked about.

600
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,540
-你怕什么  -我不怕任何东西
- What are you afraid of? - I'm not afraid of anything.

601
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:42,500
是你害怕你的历史和我的历史重演
You're the one who's afraid of your history, my history repeating.

602
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,010
不会的
It won't.

603
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,640
我相信自己的眼睛
I see what I see.

604
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,530
你本来打算投什么的
What was your vote gonna be?

605
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,700
她告诉你我每天放学之后
She told you how I got a cupcake and a Kayo

606
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,660
都有纸杯蛋糕和番茄蛋黄酱吃
every day after school.

607
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,780
但我妈没跟你说  那就是我的晚餐
What my mom didn't tell you was that was my dinner.

608
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,170
这样她用不到一美元就能喂饱我
That way, she could feed me for under a buck.

609
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,350
她两周前被裁员了
She was laid off two weeks ago.

610
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,130
但我们早说好一起吃午饭
But we already had lunch planned and

611
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,910
她非要穿制服  我还求她不要
she insisted on wearing her uniform and I begged her not to.

612
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:06,420
但她不希望你觉得
But she didn't want you to think...

613
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,990
我不希望你觉得我是为了钱
I don't want you to think that this is about money.

614
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,230
因为不是的
'Cause it's not.

615
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,880
我妈妈能撑过去
'Cause my mom will get by.

616
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,770
我们一向能撑过来
We always have.

617
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,320
这份工作对我意义非凡
This job means a lot to me.

618
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,470
我希望我们能一直走下去
And I hope it goes on for a long, long time.

619
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,420
但你对我也意义非凡
But you also mean a lot to me.

620
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,370
我希望我们也能
And I want us to go on

621
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:01,230
一直走下去
for a long, long time.

622
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,240
你给了我这份工作
You gave me this job.

623
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,210
这是你的公司
It's your company.

624
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,030
不
No.

625
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,270
公司是大家伙的
This company belongs to everybody.

626
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,180
我去打给乔
I'll call Joe.

627
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,820
告诉他我们愿意卖
I'll tell him we're selling.

628
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,240
敬今后
First of many.

629
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,320
第一步  扩招社区部技术人员
Step one, beef up support staff of the explosive Community functions.

630
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,830
第二步  为最新的游戏准备盛大发布会
Step two, prep a huge launch of the latest game,

631
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,170
《营救保卫战》
"Extract & Defend."

632
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:03,730
制造声势  全国电视全彩广告
Spectacular blitz. National TV spots, full-color ads.

633
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:07,780
游戏的事先缓缓
Let's hold off on the games just for a minute.

634
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,170
为什么
Why would we do that?

635
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:12,230
三个字CES
Three letters-- C-E-S.

636
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,750
消费电子产品展就在本月
The Consumer Electronics Show is this month,

637
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,170
据我所知
and from what I hear,

638
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:19,240
卡带主机游戏仍是大趋势
cartridge consoles still own the games business.

639
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,750
那雅达利呢  第一家一年损失破十亿的公司
What about Atari? First company to lose a billion dollars in a year.

640
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,150
任天堂
Nintendo.

641
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,170
他们的娱乐系统
This, uh, entertainment system thing

642
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,620
将在圣诞节前登陆美国
is gonna hit the States just in time for Christmas,

643
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,820
据说  她写的就是那个
and the skinny is that's all she wrote.

644
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,380
现在继续发展线上游戏
Continuing with online games at this point

645
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,450
只会是白浪费钱
would just be throwing good money after bad.

646
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:40,180
是啊  我们的确该小心行事
You're right. We should proceed with caution,

647
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,790
但游戏是大门
but games are the door.

648
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,850
能把用户吸引进来
They get users in.

649
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,660
让他们迷上网络
They get them hooked on the network.

650
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,800
游戏越好  门就越大
The better the games, the bigger the door.

651
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,510
不  社区
No. Community.

652
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,010
那才是门
That's the door.

653
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,470
依我看  也是一切
And, in my opinion, that's everything.

654
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,600
我们要发展那个
That's what we'll grow.

655
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,380
我跟他们商议的时候
A big part of my pitch to them

656
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,940
很重要的一项就是承诺创作自主权
was that they could maintain creative freedom.

657
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,600
是啊
Yeah.

658
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,880
高招啊
That was smart.

659
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,040
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

660
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,080
我...
I, um--

661
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,590
我去了公司
I went by the house.

662
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,440
他们跟我说了
They told me.

663
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,000
我们不知道是谁干的
We don't know who did it.

664
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,290
你可能永远不会知道
You probably never will.

665
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,570
六年级  第一天上学
Sixth grade, first day of school.

666
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:13,000
有人在我的储物柜上写了"基佬"
Someone wrote "fag" on my locker.

667
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,070
我去厕所拿了些纸巾
I got some paper towels from the bathroom,

668
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:19,250
弄湿  趁没人看到之前赶紧擦掉了
wet them down, and scrubbed it off before anyone could see.

669
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,690
第二天  他们用永久性马克笔写了20遍
Next day, they wrote it 20 times in a permanent marker.

670
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,340
我再也没去用我的储物柜
I never went back to my locker.

671
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:35,930
一整年都用背包背着七本教科书到处走
Carried seven textbooks in my backpack for the rest of the year.

672
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,060
我那时才11岁
I was only 11 years old,

673
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,300
就已经开始逃避了
but I was already running from something.

674
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,000
或许这让我的腿更有劲了
I guess it made my legs stronger,

675
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,260
让我的背更结实了
my back stronger.

676
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:56,700
试着真正跟人交心是很危险的
It's dangerous to try and really connect with someone.

677
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:04,060
找到一个能对其展现真我的人是很特别的
It's so special when you find a person you can be yourself with.

678
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,260
你曾经就是那个人
You were that.

679
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,360
现在是莎拉
Sara is.

680
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,610
别卖了
Don't sell.

681
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,530
他会毁了你的
He'll ruin it.

682
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,880
他并不是这么打算的  但他会的
He won't mean to, but he will.

683
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:37,230
他会挣大钱  让公司成为巨头
He'll make a ton of money, the company will be a juggernaut,

684
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:40,690
但你的愿景会被破坏  丢弃
but your vision will be corrupted and lost.

685
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:45,510
他会先叫停游戏开发
He'll start by pulling the plug on games.

686
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,450
你在干什么  乔

你之前为了让我签字那么拼命

或许你不能

但是成是败  你都能保持真我

695
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,190
那你的角色是什么

怎么了
What is it?

700
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:00,920
出什么事了
What's wrong?

705

我相信我是你爱上的那个人
I do believe I'm the person you fell in love with.

706
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,210
如果你要我走  我会走的
If you want me to go, I'll go.

707
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,540
告诉我你究竟想要什么
Just tell me what you want.

708
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,680

709
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,710
那我们就结
That's what we'll do.

710
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,900
不  就今天
No, today.

711
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,160
两周后  我们就要搬到加州

好
Okay.

713
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,400
好
Okay.

714
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,290
我跟大家说清楚
Let me just make one thing clear.

715

这是我的公司
This is my company.

716
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,740
我不会卖的

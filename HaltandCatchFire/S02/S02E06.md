	又是我
	It's me again.
	你在吗
	Are you there?
	我回到家
	Uh, I come home...
	发现你来过
	and I can tell you've been here.
	有时是柜台上的空酒瓶
	Sometimes it's an empty bottle on the counter or...
	要不就是突然少了几件你的衣服
	suddenly some of your clothes go missing.
	就好像你故意想让我看见
	I feel like you want me to see these things,
	让我察觉到  我也察觉到了
	to notice, and I do
	但我给你打电话  你又不接
	and I call, and you don't pick up.
	都一周了
	It's been a week.
	我爱你
	I love you.
	回电话吧
	Call me back.
	-莎拉  -是雅各布
	- Sara? - It's Jacob.
	业务拓展部对与穆特尼的合同
	Business Development has made a few last-minute tweaks
	做了点最后的微调
	in the Mutiny contract
	我希望今天下午就能谈妥
	and I want it out the door by this afternoon.
	我正在看呢
	I was just going over it.
	这个微调  具体是什么内容
	Um, specifically what kind of tweaks are we talking about?
	但是把穆特尼的时租费
	But jumping Mutiny's hourly rate
	从3块跳涨到5块会严重损害他们的发展
	from $3 to $5 would hamstring their growth.
	-只要一个月经营不利  -这不关我们的事
	- Say they have a bad month-- - That's not our problem.
	根据业务拓展部的说法
	According to Business Development,
	现行的市场价就是5块
	the going market rate is $5
	我们得给未来的客户竖一个先例
	We have to set a precedent for our future clients.
	反正西方集团也是白拿钱
	It's all found money to Westgroup.
	我们提供暂时的优惠价也没什么关系吧
	What difference does it make if we offer a temporary exemption?
	你怎么这么想给他们好处  乔
	Why are you so anxious to give this company a break, Joe?
	希望和你与他们创始人的私人关系无关
	I hope it's not your past relationship to the founder.
	当然不是
	Absolutely not.
	穆特尼是我们的试点工程
	Mutiny's our pilot program.
	双方都担了风险  他们拿折扣价是合理的
	We both took a risk. They got a corresponding discount.
	听着  我喜欢卡梅伦
	Look, I like Cameron,
	但我更喜欢你给我展示的方案
	but I liked the deal you pitched me a lot more.
	让一大群公司白给我们钱
	A bunch of companies give us free money
	好在我们空闲时使用我们的网络
	to use our network when we aren't.
	你就是我的楼管  乔
	You're my building manager, Joe.
	我只要交租最多的租户
	And I only want the tenants who pay the highest rent.
	雅各布  我实在无法赞同
	Jacob, I respectfully disagree.
	我们认为我们该跟穆特尼有更亲密的合作
	With Mutiny, I see our role as much more hands-on.
	这个公司创新的前景不可限量
	This is a company with a real potential to innovate.
	他们非常有才华  不过还是新手
	There's a lot of talent there, but it's raw.
	所以需要雕琢  需要指导
	It needs shaping, guidance.
	这就是我们的角色
	That's where we come in.
	那好  先报价5块
	Okay, start out at $5.
	实在谈不拢就4块
	Go down to four, if you have to,
	但是3.5块是我们的底线
	but 3.50 is the absolute bottom.
	他们要还是不签  就算了
	If they don't sign, move on.
	对  就是这里
	Yeah, right here.
	非常感谢
	Thanks so much.
	他们到啦  到啦
	They're here! They're here!
	大地主
	Landshark!
	这不是爱因斯坦嘛
	Well, if it isn't Alfred Einstein!
	想不到你们真的挪了窝
	I can't believe you got off of your butt,
	上了路
	put your feet to the ground,
	跑过来了
	and you actually showed up.
	过来吧你
	Get over here.
	这是琼妮和海莉
	Joanie and Haley?
	几年不见  你两个丫头长了100岁啊
	Wh-- you girls must have aged 100 years since I last saw you.
	还好长相随妈不随爸
	Yeah, thank God they got their mother's looks.
	乔迪  迈克尔  赶紧带堂妹去后面
	Hey, Jody, Michael, take your cousins to the back and--
	新蹦床  来啊
	New trampoline! Come on!
	-我也走了  -跳得可高了
	- I'll go. - It's really bouncy!
	快来啊
	Come on, you guys!
	你怎么样啊  还好吗
	How you doin', man? You all right?
	这么急火火地就过来了
	You up and flew out here awful fast.
	当然我很高兴见你
	Not that I'm not thrilled to see you.
	-我们待会儿细说吧  -行
	- We'll get into it a little later, yeah? - Yeah.
	找到啦
	Tada.
	多谢你找着了
	Oh, thank you for getting those.
	琼妮找不到他们  差点就不肯去加州了
	Joanie practically refused to go to California without 'em.
	我在你爸台球桌的底袋里找到的
	Found them stuck in the corner pockets of your father's pool table.
	-你还好吗  亲爱的  -好啊
	- Are okay, honey? - Yeah.
	好啊  我挺好  我得上班了
	Yeah, I'm fine. I just have to get to work.
	还好你至少早上回来歇了歇
	Well, I'm glad you at least took the morning.
	先不说你忙得四脚朝天
	You looked tired as a dog, for one thing,
	自从复活节你就没联系过我了
	and I haven't even heard from you since Easter.
	戈登带着孩子来过一趟
	Gordon's been by with the girls--
	因为戈登不用上班  时间自由
	Yeah, well, Gordon has a thing called free time.
	你还是告诉我你到底怎么了吧
	How about you tell me what's really going on?
	你和戈登又过不下去了吗
	Is it you and Gordon? Are you two having problems again?
	我
	I, uh--
	我之前怀孕了  但我...没保住
	I was pregnant, but I, uh, lost it.
	流产了
	I... miscarried.
	天哪  唐娜  宝贝  真遗憾
	Oh, my God, Donna. Honey, I'm so sorry.
	其实我...并没怀多久
	You know, I... wait, I wasn't very far along
	我一直在等合适的时候告诉戈登
	and I was waiting for the right time to tell Gordon,
	但后来...
	but then it...
	没事的  反正也没这打算
	You know, it's okay. It wasn't planned.
	就像你说的  我本来工作就够忙了
	Like you said, I'm so underwater with work as it is
	戈登和我已经
	and Gordon and I are already
	生活都快没交集了  所以...
	practically leading separate lives, so...
	会好起来的
	You know, it'll get easier.
	但需要点时间
	But it'll take time.
	我很爱现在这两个孩子
	I love the children we have.
	再来一个对她们也不公平
	You know, it really wouldn't have been fair to them.
	她们很小那段时间真的很特别
	It was a really special time when they were small,
	但现在情况不同了
	but we are in a different place now,
	这个家已经很完整了
	our family feels complete, and so...
	可能这样其实更好
	maybe in a way... maybe this is what's best.
	我赌10块他们正在搞
	我要是有10块钱
	If I had 10 bucks to burn,
	还会在这儿鼓捣同轴电缆
	you think I'd be back here wrestling coax,
	给大家偷HBO吗
	trying to steal us HBO?
	倒霉
	Damn it!
	-提醒过你了  -我赌10块钱
	- Told you. - All right, 10 bucks.
	跟我来
	Follow me.
	有人入侵我们的网络
	A sub breached the network.
	{\an3}该文件包含的是
	开机自动执行的命令
	改写后再重启
	就能运行你想要的命令
	他侵入了autoexec.bat文件He broke into the autoexec.bat file
	正在免费发账号
	and now he's giving out free user IDs.
	-该死  -快来
	- Oh, shit! - Come quick!
	-马上就来  -快跑
	- Coming! Just one second! - Go.
	发了多少...账号
	How many, uh, IDs?
	-工作时再见  -拜
	- I'll see you at work. - Bye.
	该死  我错过了
	Aw, man! I missed it!
	真逗  回去干活儿啦  快去
	That's good. Back to work, guys. Come on.
	他穿四角裤
	He wears boxers.
	伙计们
	Guys!
	这就是穆特尼啊
	So this is Mutiny.
	每小时5块根本不行
	$5 an hour is unmanageable.
	简直是胡来
	Actually, it's insane.
	万一哪个月业绩不好
	If we have one bad month
	或者我们干得不错想扩招
	or if we're doing well and we want to make new hires,
	这个价格容不得任何差池
	this leaves no room for error.
	这感觉像"上钩调包"计
	This feels like a bait and switch.
	当然就是上钩调包计
	Of course it's a bait and switch.
	-这可是乔·麦克米伦啊  -我们没这个打算
	- It's Joe MacMillan. - That's not our intent.
	因为雅各布·维勒参与进来
	With Jacob Wheeler involved,
	-情况不一样了  -他是你准岳父
	- things changed. - Your fiance's dad.
	-他们提升了规模  这我做不了主  -是啊
	- They evolved. This was out of my control. - Yeah,
	你退化回混蛋了
	you evolved back into an asshole.
	不过他整整撑了三天呢  快致敬
	Oh, but look, he held out three whole days, so hat's off.
	好吧  懂你的意思了
	Okay, message received.
	我本想亲自来  以示礼貌
	I wanted to do the courtesy of coming here in person,
	但我们提供给你们的
	but there are certainly other companies
	网络服务也有其他公司感兴趣
	who are interested in your space on our network.
	-我去联系他们  -不  听我说
	- I'll reach out to one of them. - No, look.
	让我们先谈谈
	Just give us minute.
	只有我看得清是怎么回事吗
	Am I the only one that sees what's happening here?
	先是发现是他在运营网络
	First he's the man behind the network,
	现在他又想变更协议条款
	now he's changing our deal terms?
	-下一步呢  -听着  我也不开心
	- What's next? - Look, I don't like it either.
	但他的网络对我们的发展太重要
	But his network is the best thing to happen to us,
	而且目前  我们更需要他的帮助
	and right now we need him more than he needs us.
	是啊  他很清楚这点
	Yes, and he knows it.
	是啊  可如果你能冷静点
	Yes, but if you can keep your cool,
	我就能谈到一个更好的价钱
	I can get us a number we can live with
	那样他就又是
	and then he's back to being
	合同第12页上的一个名字了  行吗
	a name on the 12th page of our contract, right?
	好吧
	Fine.
	那个...
	So, uh...
	你之前和卡梅伦在卡迪夫共事吗
	you and Cameron worked together at Cardiff, huh?
	是的
	We did.
	她这个老板很有意思吧
	She must be an interesting boss.
	她清楚自己想要什么
	She knows what she wants.
	你帮他们推销个人计算机吗
	You ran PCs for them?
	我跟技术打交道很久了
	I've been knocking around tech for a long time,
	一直在创造下一个新潮流
	always working to the next new thing.
	分时也没那么新鲜
	Well, time-sharing's not that new.
	分时只是敲门砖
	Time-sharing's just a way in.
	计算机服务最初只是一家保险公司的一个部门
	CompuServe started as a division of a life insurance company,
	之后布洛克税务公司为多样化业务而收购了他们
	then got bought by H&R Block who wanted to diversify.
	如今发展成了
	Now it's a 500-pound gorilla
	网络服务提供商里的巨头
	in the world of commercial online service.
	谁知道西方集团将来能有什么样的发展呢
	Who knows where Westgroup can take it from there?
	嗯  那么你们怎么处理安全问题
	Yeah. So, how are you guys handling security?
	你们是通过可切换进程的多个调制解调器
	Are you multiplexing them in from an SNA network
	构建的共享网络架构让外部用户接入的吗
	from the modem banks with task-switching...
	当构想需要工程实现时  雇人就行了
	Comes a time when vision meets engineering-- you hire people.
	谢谢你的咖啡
	Thanks for the coffee.
	既然你说了你的原则  我也说了我的
	So, you've said your party line, I've said mine.
	那就别再装了  谈谈实际价格吧
	Let's cut the posturing and we'll get down to the real number.
	-5块  -乔
	- $5. - Joe.
	-就5块  -不
	- It's $5. - No.
	现在  你要说4.5块  然后我说3.5块
	No, this is where you say 4.50 and then I say 3.50,
	最终我们敲定为4块  这说得过去
	and then eventually we settle on four, which is fair.
	$4.
	$5.
	这不是协商
	This isn't a negotiation.
	你们一开始享受促销价
	You started at a promotional rate.
	-这难道不是协商吗  -现在促销结束了
	- I'm sorry, this isn't a negotiation? - That promotion is over.
	如果你们不同意5块
	If you don't agree to the $5 terms,
	-西方集团就不干了  -不干了吗
	- Westgroup is moving on. - Moving on?
	-那不是...  -做慈善吗
	- That's-that's not... - Charity?
	不是的  这是合作关系
	No, it's not. This is a partnership.
	雅各布·维勒对和你们发展
	Jacob Wheeler isn't interested
	一般的房东-租客关系没兴趣
	in a typical landlord-tenant relationship with you.
	他想要与敏锐
	He wants to work with
	全心投入  充满创新精神的公司合作
	innovative companies who are agile and committed.
	$5 is the ante for this table.
	如果穆特尼无法以市场价参与竞争
	If Mutiny can't compete at the going market rate,
	也许它就该退出游戏了
	maybe it shouldn't be in the game.
	唐娜
	Donna?
	唐娜
	Donna?
	这就是扯淡
	This is bullshit!
	乔  这都是扯淡
	Joe, this is bullshit!
	你所拥有的就是服务器的空闲时间
	All you own is time on a network.
	你有什么资格对我们在这里所做的一切指手画脚
	What entitles you to have an opinion about anything that we do here?
	你凭什么觉得你可以为1块的时租费
	What makes you think that you can question our commitment
	质疑我们的投入呢
	for one dollar an hour?
	-冷静点  -我没事  没事
	- Calm down. - I'm fine, I'm fine.
	天哪
	God...
	也许和一个亿万富翁上床
	Maybe being in bed with a billionaire,
	抱歉  是和亿万富翁的女儿上床让你觉得
	I'm sorry, with a billionaire's daughter makes you think
	-你可以耍我们取乐  -唐娜
	- that you can jerk us around for your own amusement... - Donna.
	但我们是拿这当真的
	but this is real to us.
	所以是4块  乔
	So it's $4, Joe.
	是4块
	It's $4.
	-别  -算了吧
	- Just... - Don't bother.
	没事的
	It's fine.
	他会在三小时内打电话来
	He's gonna call in three hours
	说是4块
	and he's gonna say $4.
	他在虚张声势
	He's bluffing.
	这就是我的处境
	So, that's where I'm at.
	听着
	Uh, look...
	需要什么就告诉我  好吗
	anything you need, okay?
	什么都行  随你说  好吗
	Anything at all, you just say the word, okay?
	还有孩子们  她们可以来和我们住
	And the girls, they can come stay with us,
	或者如果你需要  我可以过去
	or I could fly out if you need, you know?
	-好  -天哪  戈登
	- Yeah, yeah. - Jesus, Gordon.
	真的  没事的
	Seriously, it's okay, all right?
	我知道这很让人震惊
	I know it's a shock.
	我不该那样一股脑告诉你
	I shouldn't have laid it all on you at once like that.
	抱歉  是我该安慰你
	Jesus, I'm sorry. I should be the one comforting...
	我能做什么呢
	What can I do?
	亨利  你已经在做了
	Hey, Henry, you're already doing it, okay?
	没事的
	It's all right.
	出了这样的事  唐娜一定难过极了
	Donna must be a mess with all this going on.
	其实  她不知道
	Actually, uh, she doesn't know.
	-戈登  -你不知道
	- Gordon... - Look, you have no idea
	我们去年是怎么过的
	what the last year has been like.
	她的事业蒸蒸日上
	I mean, you know, her work's taking off,
	这让她充满动力
	you know, and it's driving her, you know,
	像我以前那样
	like... well, like mine used to, you know?
	她很快乐  精力充沛
	She's happy, okay? She's energized.
	如果告诉她了  她就得停下手头的一切来照顾我
	And she'd stop everything to take care of me
	我开不了口让她那么做
	and I can't ask her to do that.
	至少  还没到时候
	Not...not yet, at least.
	那么  如果我们得换回XT
	So, um, if we had to switch back to XTs,
	这需要多长时间
	how long would that take?
	我们不需要那么做
	We're not gonna have to do it.
	好吧  但万一需要的话
	Okay, but just in case we do,
	-大概要多少  -我很抱歉
	- just round number it for me. - Look, I'm sorry, okay?
	我不知道你还想让我说什么
	I don't know what else you want me to say.
	出事了
	Guys?
	怎么了
	What?
	不是调制解调器的问题
	It's not the modem.
	怎么了  出什么事了
	What is it? What happened?
	是乔·麦克米伦
	Joe MacMillan happened!
	他停了网
	He pulled the plug!
	看来他不是在虚张声势
	So I guess he wasn't bluffing.
	好了  好了  好了
	Okay, okay, okay.
	你是想给他打个电话
	Um, so do you want to call him, maybe,
	还是要再哭一次
	or are you just gonna cry again?
	-行了  -说话啊  唐娜
	- That's enough. - Come on, Donna.
	就因为你出色的谈判技巧
	The name on page 12 of our contract
	合同第12页上的名字
	just shut our company down
	-刚刚让我们公司停工了  -卡梅伦
	- because of your great negotiation skills! -  Cameron.
	你能不能不在
	Could you have had your day on the rag
	这么关键的时候闹崩溃啊
	when the entire network wasn't at stake?
	行了  闭嘴吧  妈的
	I said that's enough, damn it!
	你是怎么回事
	God, what is wrong with you?
	我会想办法解决的
	I'm-- I'm gonna fix it.
	我会解决的
	I'm gonna fix it.
	这几年店里的生意越来越糟
	Oh, the shop's been slippin' the last few years.
	我仍然觉得可以挺过去
	I still think we can pull it out,
	但爸爸想卖掉  卖给连锁店
	but Dad wants to sell it, let it get turned into a Midas.
	那你怎么办
	Where does that leave you?
	我会留下  给新店主干活儿
	I'd stay on, work for the new owners.
	那怎么像话
	Oh, come on, that doesn't seem right.
	我会给他打电话  告诉他他做错了
	I'm gonna call him, tell him he's making a mistake.
	不不不
	Oh, no, no, no, no.
	你自己的事就够烦了
	You've-- you've got enough on your plate right now.
	现在几点了
	Oh, what time is it?
	我们该结账走人了吗
	Should we settle up?
	回去帮帮温蒂
	You know, go give Wendy some relief?
	好啊  我去趟厕所
	Uh, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna go hit the head.
	你来结...
	You wanna get the--
	服务员  结账
	Excuse me, can we get our tab?
	-茱尔丝·达菲  -戈登  我的天
	- Ju-- Jules Duffy? - Gordon. I'll be damned.
	你不是有钱有名了吗
	Thought you'd gone all rich and famous on us.
	没错  我的飞机就停在外面
	Yeah, I got my plane parked out back.
	我和亨利一起来的
	I'm here with Henry.
	我经常看见他
	Yeah, I see plenty of Henry.
	你俩还在努力恢复高中时的关系吗
	You two still trying to get back what you had in high school?
	没有  我在努力
	Nope, just trying to get him
	让他把酒钱还上  但几乎不可能
	to pay his bar tab every once in a blue moon.
	你还记得有一次  我碰到你和亨利
	Hey, you remember that time that I caught you and Henry
	偷拿我爸的藏酒吗
	breaking into Dad's liquor cabinet?
	你俩逼我喝了一咖啡杯的白兰地
	Y'all made me drink a coffee cup full of brandy
	好让我不能告发你俩
	just so I couldn't tell on you?
	不记得  我们成功了吗
	No. Did it work?
	天呐  第二天早上我差点死掉
	God, I nearly died the next morning.
	房子还在原处  你可以随时去玩
	The house is still there. You can come by anytime.
	嗯  我会从亨利以前屋的窗户爬进去
	Yeah, I'll just crawl into Henry's old window,
	吓坏他的孩子  不管我的孩子
	scare hikids, leave mine alone.
	-你有孩子了  -12了
	- You have kids? - He's 12.
	你有12个孩子
	You have 12 kids?
	我只有一个儿子  12岁
	I have one kid, 12 years old.
	他是我的精神支柱  RJ
	He's my anchor. R.J.
	茱尔丝·达菲  已经结婚生子了
	Jules Duffy, married with a kid.
	说对一半  我是单身妈妈
	Well, half right. Single mom.
	好了  付款吧
	All right, pay up, pecker.
	听说你发财了  多给点小费
	Heard you got rich, so big tip.
	刚才是怎么回事
	What the hell was that about?
	-你还问我吗  -是啊
	- You're asking me? - Yeah.
	她失控了  这下我们完蛋了
	She lost it. Now we're dead.
	唐娜做的和你每天做的一样
	All Donna did was behave like you do every day
	只不过没像以前一样替你收拾烂摊子
	without bailing you out for it like usual.
	-或许你不喜欢那样  -我从没...
	- You know, maybe you didn't like it... - I never--
	因为那就像照镜子一样
	...because it was like looking in a damn mirror!
	人们的生活中还有其他
	People have other things going on in their lives
	你不知道的事
	that you don't know about.
	你知道  是吗
	And you do, huh?
	你看不出来她现在遇到麻烦了吗
	Can't you see that that woman is going through something?
	她现在需要朋友
	She could use a friend right now.
	我太过分了  我道歉
	I was out of line and I apologize.
	这份工作
	This work--
	这份工作对我意义重大
	this work means a lot to me.
	如果我们接受你的条件  就是拿前途冒险
	And if we accept your deal, we're risking our survival,
	如果我们不接受  就要挣扎好几个月
	and if we don't, we could scramble for months
	再找个网络
	to try and find another network.
	就这行来说  这几个月足以毁了我们
	Months in this business could crush us.
	你也不希望如此  不是吗
	That's not what you want, is it?
	-如果是因为卡梅伦  -不是
	- If this is about Cameron-- - It's not.
	只为一美元就停止供网
	Then to pull the plug over one dollar,
	不想做这笔生意才会这么做
	that's what you do when you're trying to get out of a deal.
	我们现在就是这个情况
	Which is where we find ourselves now.
	不把这件事解决了  我不会走的
	Well, I can't leave here until we work this out,
	所以  你告诉我
	so you tell me.
	我要怎么做
	What can I do?
	也许价格还有得商量
	Maybe-- uh, maybe I could find some wiggle room on the price
	前提是穆特尼能够...
	if Mutiny met a few, um...
	满足几项条件
	strategic benchmarks.
	条件
	Benchmarks.
	比如说  我登录穆特尼的时候
	For example, when I log onto Mutiny,
	主界面非常无聊
	the main screen, it's boring.
	休斯顿一家公司
	There's a company in Houston
	登录后可以看见新闻和天气
	that has news and weather as soon as you log on.
	{\an1}基于Object Pascal的
	应用程序开发软件
	Delphi有旅游中介
	Delphi has a travel agency.
	加尔维斯顿有家公司
	There's an outfit in Galveston
	每小时更新股票行情
	that has a stock ticker updated hourly.
	这种东西
	That's the kind of thing
	会让用户想浏览更久
	that makes me the user want to stay longer.
	这个可以有
	We can do that.
	还有  做一个通信功能
	Another thing-- check out the messaging
	就像IBM的V网一样
	available on something like IBM's Vnet.
	邮件程序已经普及十多年了
	Mail programs have been around for over a decade.
	没错  为什么穆特尼没有呢
	Exactly. Why doesn't Mutiny have one?
	因为这不...
	Because that's not--
	邮件功能可以做
	We can do mail
	界面也可以完善
	and we can do the interface,
	如果我们都做了呢
	and if we do...
	他不会乐意的  不过
	He's not gonna like it, but
	如果你们能满足最后一个条件
	I, uh, bet I could get Jacob
	我应该可以说服雅各布便宜一美元
	to shave off a buck for one last thing.
	是什么  你需要什么
	What? What is it that you need?
	穆特尼现在只能在康懋达64上运行  对吧
	Mutiny currently runs exclusively on Commodore 64s, right?
	与此同时  UNIX正在成为主流
	In the meantime, UNIX is poised to explode.
	如果穆特尼能够移植到运行UNIX系统的机器上
	If Mutiny could port to a machine that runs UNIX,
	比如新式AT&T电脑
	say the new AT&T box,
	我想我可以争取个低一点的价格
	I think I could justify a lower price.
	但UNIX是完全不同的操作系统
	But UNIX is a completely different operating system.
	这需要彻底重新编程
	That's a major coding overhaul--
	事实上  我现在就可以重新恢复供网
	In fact, I would go so far as to plug you back in right now,
	-按5美元签合同  -但是...
	- ink the contract at $5... - But--
	再附加一条  一旦你们满足这些条件
	and add a provision that once you meet these benchmarks,
	我们就把价格降至3.5块
	we'll drop it down to 3.50.
	我会想办法的
	I'll see what I can do.
	UNIX  老天啊
	UNIX? Christ.
	我觉得他今早过来之前
	I think he knew he wanted these benchmarks
	就想好这些条件了
	before he ever came over here this morning.
	他只是在耍手段
	It was all just about leverage.
	好吧  看来的确本就不是协商
	Yeah. Well, I guess it was a negotiation after all.
	但AT&T都不是彩屏
	But the AT&T isn't even in color.
	往好处看看嘛
	Hey, let's look at the bright side.
	我们现在有股票行情和邮件了
	I guess we'll have stock ticker and mail now.
	好极了  咱们走在79年技术最前沿了
	Great, we'll be bleeding edge for 1979.
	邮件系统有模板的
	You know, there are blueprints to build mail out
	因为到处都在用
	because it's been around forever.
	这个不会花太久
	It wouldn't take that long.
	-棒  谢了  -我只是想帮忙
	- Cool. Thanks. - Just trying to help.
	我不知道我们还有什么选择
	Look, I just-- I don't know what choice we have.
	可以假造UNIX系统
	You could fake UNIX.
	伪装成穆特尼在AT&T上运行的样子
	Make it look like Mutiny is running on the AT&T,
	先把低价合同签下来
	get your better rate locked in now,
	以后有空慢慢搞多平台移植
	actually go multiplatform at your leisure.
	我今天早上跟他聊过  他懂编程没错
	I talked to him this morning and he knows the script, sure,
	但他的技术知识很有限
	but his actual tech knowledge is really limited.
	你们明早叫他过来
	If you get him in here tomorrow morning
	让他看演示程序  如果做得足够逼真
	and you sit him down at a demo, and if it looked real enough--
	不行  64和AT&T的
	No, the boot and interface screens
	启动过程和界面完全不同
	for the 64 and the AT&T are completely different.
	没错  但是屏幕的样子我们可以随便弄
	Yeah, but we can paint the screens however we want.
	写个康懋达程序
	I mean, write a Commodore program
	让它看起来跟AT&T一样
	that makes it look just like the AT&T.
	但乔知道移植到
	But Joe would know that porting
	UNIX这样的操作系统上需要一天以上
	to an OS like UNIX would take longer than 24 hours.
	是吗
	Would he?
	怎么  你要说"烂主意"吗
	What, you're gonna say, "Bad idea"?
	这就是烂主意
	It is a bad idea.
	我们在康懋达64上运行演示程序
	So we run the demo off a C64
	等到明晚再叫他过来
	and we don't invite him till tomorrow night.
	目标很简单  将这台AT&T电脑
	The goal is simple: replace the guts of this AT&T box
	内里换成康懋达的
	with those of a Commodore,
	将里面的显卡跟单色显像管连起来
	hook up the video cards inside to the monochrome CRT.
	乔启动时  他会以为是在操作UNIX系统
	When Joe boots up, he'll think he's running UNIX,
	但其实是我们的64
	but really it'll be our 64.
	披着UNIX皮的狼
	A wolf in UNIX clothing.
	好了  螺丝刀
	Okay, screwdriver.
	这东西里面只能放下一个内置串行调制解调器
	The thing only has enough room for an internal serial modem.
	要怎么把外置调制解调器放进去啊
	How the hell are we supposed to fit an external Hayes box inside?
	-还有康懋达的功能卡呢  -我们可以把卡
	- Let alone the Commodore cards. - We could lay the cards flat
	放在外面  用排线连起来
	and connect them out the back with ribbon cables.
	金属接头会跟机箱和彼此接触到
	The metal connections will touch the case and each other
	-造成短路  -可以在之间塞纸板
	- and short everything out. - We could put cardboard between.
	那就又产生冷却问题了
	Well, then we'll have a cooling problem,
	如果还能放下风扇的话
	if we can even fit the fan.
	除非  我们不用风扇
	Unless we don't even use a fan.
	嗯  他进门前打开
	Yeah, we just turn it on before he gets here
	在融坏前赶他走
	and kick him out before it melts.
	或者你们可以慢慢来  真做出来
	Or you could just take your time, do it for real.
	时租费5块  我们耗不起
	Well, we don't have that kind of time at $5 an hour.
	那么是为了价钱  不是为了乔喽
	So it's about price, it's not about Joe.
	两者都有
	No, it's about both.
	不能让他来左右我们的设想
	It's about not letting him dictate our vision.
	但他要求的这些东西
	But couldn't this make Mutiny better,
	是不是能让穆特尼变得更好呢
	these things that he wants?
	好吧  我不打扰你们了
	All right, I'll leave you to it.
	你一向是天才的那个
	You always were the prodigy.
	变速器方面可不行
	Mm, not with transmissions.
	你在那方面一向比我强
	You always kicked my ass at those.
	你觉得是那东西害你得病的吗
	You think that stuff made you sick?
	可能吧  但在汽修店工作让我成为了工程师
	Maybe, but that time in the shop made me an engineer, you know?
	机器的内部结构都是一个道理
	Guts in a machine equals guts in a machine.
	爸爸肯定希望是你留下照顾汽修店
	You know, I bet Dad wishes you had stayed behind to run the shop.
	我明天借你的车开开吧
	Hey, why don't I borrow your truck tomorrow?
	我去萨克拉门托  跟爸爸谈谈
	I'll head up to Sacramento, talk to Dad?
	好啊
	Yeah.
	好啊  行
	Yeah, of course. Yeah.
	但我得跟你说一声
	Um, I should warn you, though, that some...
	一周前左右  有个混蛋倒车撞到我了
	some jag-off backed into it a week or so ago
	现在只剩一个车前灯了
	and so there's just one headlight.
	好  我会小心的
	I know. I'll be careful.
	-很高兴能再见到你  弟弟  -嗯
	- It's really good to see you, brother. - Yeah.
	谢谢你来见我
	Hey, thanks for meeting me.
	没事  你想去哪谈
	Not a problem. So where you wanna have this talk?
	上车
	Hop in.
	工作周去的多频繁
	So, how often during the work week?
	上次酒吧斗殴之后少一些了
	Well, a little less since that bar fight,
	但还是有三四天吧
	but probably still three, four days,
	大都是上午
	often before noon.
	-温蒂知道吗  -是的
	- Does Wendy know? - Oh, she knows.
	车呢
	And the truck?
	几周前  他一直待到关门后
	He stayed till after close a couple weeks ago.
	第二天  他说为避一只鹿撞车了
	Next day, he said he swerved to avoid a deer.
	嗯  我打给了爸爸
	Yeah, I called my dad.
	不过他听到的故事里是兔子
	Although, it was a rabbit when he heard that story.
	总之  这就是你酒鬼哥哥的无聊故事
	So, anyway, that's the boring-ass story of your alcoholic brother.
	如果你听够了  我就回家去照顾孩子了
	If you've heard enough, I think I'll get home to my kid,
	不再唠叨我的高中男友了
	stop narcing on my high school boyfriend.
	我包里现在就有大麻呢
	Hell, I got weed in my purse right now.
	还好意思自称妈妈
	Call myself a mother.
	怎么了
	What?
	我相信你一定是个好妈妈
	I'm sure you're a great mother.
	我还觉得大麻现在听起来很诱人
	I was also thinking how great weed sounds to me right now.
	外置调制解调器装不下
	The external modem is not gonna fit.
	机箱够大  但不够高
	The box, it's big enough, but it's not tall enough, okay?
	The L clips on the 64 serial port, they're too high.
	我们还得锯矮
	We had to hacksaw them down.
	但外置调制解调器就露馅了
	Yeah, but an external modem will give it away.
	所以不能...
	We can't...
	能不能假装在联网呢
	Could we fake an online connection?
	让乔拨号上网  但其实只是跟
	Have Joe dial into the network, but he's actually just linked
	屋里的另一台康懋达相连
	to another Commodore in the house?
	-我真把你教坏了  -好主意
	- I have completely corrupted you. - That's a great idea.
	但什么线传输速度够快
	But what cable's gonna be fast enough
	露在外面又不会被人识破呢
	and also not completely give it away by being out in the open?
	等等  如果我们...
	Wait, what if we...
	卡尔  你们把HBO连好了吗
	Carl, did you guys ever get the HBO working?
	算是吧  我们那天晚上看《豹妹》
	Uh, kind of. Like, we watched "Cat People" the other night.
	可以看到半个奶子...
	You could see about half a boob, which we...
	天呐  同轴电缆
	Oh, my God! The coax.
	-嗯  -10BROAD36[以太网一种网络标准]
	- Yes. - 10BROAD36.
	我们可以用以太网编码
	We can use Ethernet encoding.
	而且  电缆就预埋在墙里
	Plus... plus, the cable's already hidden along the walls.
	我们只需要调到我们需要的地方
	We can just adjust it where we need to.
	但我们还得弄出调制解调器的声音
	We'll still need to hear a modem, though.
	-博迪  -什么事
	- Bodie? - Yeah?
	你还有那台小录音机吗
	Do you still have that little recorder?
	去录一段调制解调器连接的声音
	Okay, go record the modem connecting.
	然后扯出录音机的电源开关
	Then we'll pull out the recorder's power switch,
	在上面接线
	we'll run wires up it,
	-塞进AT&T的机器里  -找人把线捏在一起
	- stash the whole thing in the AT&T... - Someone pinches the wires
	-就播放录音  -这就去
	- and then it triggers the recording. - On it.
	-同轴电缆改装要多久  -至多两小时
	- Okay, how much time do you need for the coax? - Two hours, tops.
	天呐  我第一次抽之后特别疑神疑鬼
	Oh, my God, I was so paranoid after that first experience.
	我好像到大学前都没再抽
	I think I stopped getting high till college.
	然后又补上了
	And then you made up for it.
	是啊  那可是伯克利啊
	I totally made up for it. It was Berkeley.
	是啊  你一直是聪明的那个
	Yeah, yeah, you were always the smart one.
	你如果觉得我聪明  为什么跟亨利约会
	If I was so smart, why'd you go out with Henry?
	我当时才16  他比较帅
	I was 16. He was the cute one.
	天呐
	Oh, jeez!
	他一向不如你风趣
	He was never as funny as you.
	亨利接得一手好球
	Henry could catch a pass,
	但却是你在观众席上逗得我们哈哈笑
	but you always had us cracking up in the stands.
	天呐
	Jesus.
	怎么了
	What?
	只是很久没人
	It's just been a long time
	觉得我风趣了
	since anyone's thought of me as being funny.
	我们长大后的样子真是有趣啊
	You know, it's so interesting who we grow up to be.
	你有没有想过  如果你的选择不同
	Have you ever thought about who you could've been
	现在会是什么样吗
	if you'd have taken a different path?
	当然
	Sure.
	什么意思  你觉得你当初该做别的吗
	So, what are you saying, you should've done something else?
	留在这儿  在公路旁卖拖拉机
	Stayed here? Sold tractors off the 5?
	你没什么可抱怨的
	You got nothing to complain about.
	是啊
	Yeah.
	天呐  坐在这里
	God, it feel so good to just sit here
	跟你一起干坏事感觉真好
	and do the wrong thing with you.
	可别让我耽搁你
	Well, I don't want to keep you.
	你一定有比
	I'm sure you got better things to do
	闲坐在卡车后面
	than sit in the back of a truck
	听我唠叨更要紧的事要做
	and just listen to me babble on.
	是啊  我有
	Yeah, actually I do.
	我很开心
	I'm having a good time.
	登录吧
	Okay, log on.
	不赖啊
	Not bad.
	嗯  但也就是单色
	Yeah, for monochrome.
	-玩点什么吧  -等等
	- Go ahead, play something. - Whoa, hang on.
	我想看看邮件
	I wanna... I wanna see mail.
	是在游戏里面  随便选个你想玩的
	Uh, so it's inside the game, so select what you wanna play.
	好的  在用户列表上找到莱夫
	Okay, and now find Lev on the user list.
	我是新浪潮莱夫
	I'm NewWaveLev.
	然后按Alt+M
	Okay, then hit Alt+M.
	这还是社区啊
	This is still Community.
	是啊  我们基于现有代码编写了邮件客户端
	Exactly. We built the mail client on top of the existing code.
	如果用户在线上
	So if a user is online,
	他们就能即时收到信息  如果不在线
	they get the message instantly, and if they're offline...
	莱夫  下线
	Lev, sign off...
	"上帝带来了什么"
	and, "What hath God wrought?"
	好了  莱夫  再上线
	Okay, now, Lev, sign back on.
	好了
	Now.
	真聪明
	That's very clever.
	你要求的我们都做到了
	Okay, so, that's everything you asked for.
	看来是的
	Looks like it.
	等等  我都打开游戏了
	Wait, wait, wait. I've got a game open.
	我想玩一局
	I want to play it.
	嗯  玩吧
	Yeah, go... play it. Go ahead.
	再玩玩别的吧  看这里
	Here, try something else. There's...
	不  我想再玩一局象棋
	No, I want to play chess again.
	-这个怎么样...  -再来一局
	- What about... - One more time.
	我觉得很有意思
	I find it remarkable
	居然有三位穆特尼用户
	that three different human Mutiny users
	都用相同的王翼印度防御开局
	opened with the same King's Indian defense.
	简直像是编程好了的
	It's almost as if they were programmed to do so.
	你的电脑要化在桌上了
	Your computer is melting to the table.
	看啊
	Here.
	真有意思
	Interesting.
	我还没见过这样的康懋达呢
	I've never seen a Commodore like this before.
	肯定是独家版本
	Must be an exclusive model.
	看啊
	And look...
	没有调制解调器
	there's no modem.
	我们根本没联网
	We're not even online.
	UNIX
	Unix.
	你做不到
	You couldn't do it.
	不是做不到
	Oh, it's not that we couldn't do it,
	我们就是觉得那是浪费时间
	we just thought it was a waste of time.
	但你却有时间修改游戏
	But you did have time to animate the games,
	给机器换里  伪造数据
	gut the box, fake the data.
	你怎么传输的
	How are you streaming it?
	-乔  -干什么  你想怎么样
	- Joe? - What? What do you want?
	要再侮辱我一次  说我是个坏人
	You want to insult me again, say I'm a bad guy,
	玩上钩调包吗  我给你连了网
	a bait and switch artist? I put you on the network.
	我提了一个我老板不满意的协议
	I handed you a deal my boss didn't want you to have.
	不要再这么坑我一次
	Don't do this to me again.
	这是你自作自受
	You did this to yourself.
	最让我难受的是  你不该这么下作
	What kills me about it is you're so much better than this.
	我有话要跟你说
	I have to tell you something.
	没想到这晚上会变成这样
	Well, this night took a turn.
	怎么了
	What?
	我能跟你说实话吗
	Can I be honest with you?
	戈登  我是个大人了  我明白这是怎么回事
	Gordon, I'm a big girl. I know what this is.
	我有毛病
	There's something wrong with me.
	说点我不知道的
	Tell me something I don't know.
	不  我真的有毛病
	No, there's something wrong with me.
	是我的脑子
	It's in my brain.
	我的手和说话都出过问题
	I've had problems with my hands and my speech.
	而且可能好不起来了
	I may not ever be the same.
	情况或许会更糟
	I mean, it may even get worse.
	戈登  我很遗憾
	Gordon, I'm sorry.
	-我  -我很怕
	- I... - I'm scared.
	我真的很怕
	Like, I'm really scared.
	没事的
	It's okay.
	害怕是正常的
	I mean, it's okay to be scared.
	换了我也会害怕的
	I'd probably be scared, too.
	我有点想相信
	Part of me wanted to believe
	如果我不说出来  就不会是真的了
	that if I didn't say anything, it wouldn't be real.
	但这份重担
	But the weight of it...
	我理解
	I understand.
	你无法想象我最近多难熬
	You can't imagine what it's been like.
	这意味着什么啊
	I mean, what does this mean?
	-我的孩子怎么办  -戈登
	- You know, what about my kids? - Gordon, I...
	我会不会哪天醒来  动不了腿了
	Am I gonna wake up one day and not feel my legs?
	他们是不是得送我去疗养院了
	Are they gonna have to put me in a home?
	天呐  茱尔丝  我可能会死
	I mean, Jesus, Jules, I could die.
	我还没告诉我老婆呢
	And I haven't even told my wife.
	-什么  -我不能  她有工作
	- What? - I can't, her job.
	这些事我一直一个人憋着
	I've been carrying this all alone.
	住口  停下
	Okay, stop. Stop.
	戈登  你在干什么呢
	Gordon, what are you doing right now?
	没什么  我们就是说说话
	Nothing. We're just talking.
	不  你在把这些问题都丢给我
	No, no, you're dumping all this on me.
	-什么  -等等  你是为了这个吗
	- Wait, what? - Wait, is that what this is?
	你是为这个才带我出来吗
	Is that why you brought me out here?
	-你好卸下重担  -不是
	- So you could unburden yourself? - No.
	如果你想找人谈心
	Look, if you wanted someone to talk to...
	-等等  茱尔丝  -天呐
	- Wait, Jules. - Oh, my God.
	我很感激你
	I'm grateful to you.
	-感激  -是啊
	- Grateful? - Yeah.
	茱尔丝
	Jules.
	唐娜
	You know, Donna,
	穆特尼可能完了
	Mutiny might be done.
	我们明天可能就倒闭了
	I mean, we might not exist tomorrow.
	如果你是为公司才这么做
	So if you're doing this for the company...
	不是为了那个
	That's not why I'm doing this.
	要我陪你吗
	Do you want me to come with you?
	不用
	It's all right.
	谢谢
	Thanks.
	嗯
	Yeah.
	{\pos(239.1,113.515)}计划生育
	我不知道  爸爸
	Look, I don't know, Dad.
	怎么回事  你没事吧
	Hey, what happened? You okay?
	-你去哪了  -过来
	- Where were you? - Come here.
	她醒来之后  不知道你去哪了
	She woke up and didn't know where you were.
	我打给了爸爸  但你大概是没赶到
	I tried Dad, but I guess you didn't make it.
	是啊  我去
	Yeah, I had to stop
	找茱尔丝谈了点事
	and talk to Jules about a few things.
	-你开玩笑吗  -亨利
	- You kidding me? - Henry.
	你们不可能只是谈谈
	Yeah, like hell you were just talking.
	你身上一股大麻味儿  还有...
	Yeah, you smell like weed and you also smell like...
	亨利  怎么回事
	Henry! What is going on?
	我告诉你
	What's going on
	我弟弟还是一如既往的自私混蛋
	is my brother's a selfish prick and he always has been.
	你冷静点
	Hey, get ahold of yourself.
	我以为你是开车去找爸爸  帮我呢
	I thought you were driving up to talk to Dad to help me out.
	我去达菲酒吧之前  跟爸爸通了电话
	I did talk to Dad on the phone before I went to Duffy's.
	他说你这三年来举债经营
	He said that you leveraged the shop into the ground
	一点点把店耗没了  还气走了大半客户
	over the past three years and pissed away half the customers.
	-扯淡  -他担心你  亨利
	- That's bullshit! - Look, he's worried about you, Henry.
	-我也担心你  -好吧  是这样吗
	- I'm worried about you. - Okay, so let me get this straight.
	你上了我前女友
	So you... you bang my ex-girlfriend,
	背着你妻子偷腥  就因为我酗酒
	cheated on your wife because I drink too much?
	听着  我们只是在谈话
	Listen to me, we were just talking.
	还当面跟我撒谎
	Now you're lying to my face!
	你今晚不能留在这儿
	You can't stay here tonight.
	听着  亨利
	Hey, listen, Henry,
	我之所以飞过来
	the whole reason that I flew out here...
	走吧  戈登
	Please, just leave, Gordon.
	-走吧  -爸爸
	- Just go. - Daddy.

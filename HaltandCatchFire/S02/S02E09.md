	这是唯一没被他们偷走的东西  对吗
	I mean, that's the only thing they didn't steal, right?
	《营救保卫战》是我们最新的游戏
	"Extract & Defend" is our freshest title.
	它应该能卖个好价钱让我们维持下去
	I think it can fetch enough to keep us afloat.
	你真要那样吗  你要卖吗
	You would do that? You would sell?

	我只是不希望你这么草率  好吗
	I just don't want you to act too hastily, okay?
	或者说  惊慌
	Or... or... or panic.

	要去西部了  年轻人
	go west, young man.
	那里前景很广阔呢
	Still a wide-open business.
	说不定能发展大好  另辟蹊径
	Do well, blaze a trail, who knows?
	或许西方集团哪天会在那儿开分公司呢
	Maybe Westgroup will open an office out there someday.

	You didn't seriously think that bullshit would buy my silence?
	当然
	No.
	你太意气用事  不会就这么罢休
	You're far too emotional for that.
	你盗取了别人的知识产权
	You stole intellectual property.
	事实上  我是先想花钱买的
	Actually, I tried to buy it.
	而且我记得  开价还不低
	A very generous offer, as I recall.
	只是那交易不知怎么出了问题
	Only the deal went south somehow.
	没必要拐弯抹角  是我背着你拆台
	No need to dance. I went behind your back.
	我建议穆特尼不要卖而且我不后悔
	I told Mutiny not to sell and I'm glad.

	What if I went public?

	Do you remember what level you were on?
	我没太注意

	这些人是谁
	Who are these people?
	我打了将近一百通电话
	Out of, like, 100 cold calls,
	他们是唯一回电话的
	they're the ones that called back.
	听说他们只成立了几周
	Word is they're just a few weeks old.
	是啊
	Yeah.
	西方集团没让步喽
	So Westgroup didn't back down?
	没  那混蛋对我们的和解协议嗤之以鼻
	No, the creep practically blew his nose in our settlement offer.
	乔怎么说的
	What did Joe say?
	他没在
	He wasn't there.
	我觉得乔不知道西方网络的事
	I don't think Joe knew about Westnet.
	我觉得也许他说的是真话
	I think maybe he was telling us the truth.
	好了  可以进来了
	Okay, we're ready for you.
	实际上  伙计们  今天在这边谈
	Oh, actually, guys, we're in here today.
	好吧  走吧
	Okay, well, here we go.
	也许你该去的
	Maybe you should go.
	去股东大会吗
	To the shareholders' meeting?
	是啊  他不会料到你会去
	Yeah, I mean, he'd never expect it.
	他觉得你太骄傲
	He thinks you're too proud.
	但是想想看
	But think about it.
	你去参会  站在大家面前
	You know, you go there in front of everyone.
	让他们知道那是你促成的  你的主意
	Let them see that it started with you, your vision.
	从这场失败中捞到点好处
	Just try and pull something good out of this fiasco.
	然后我们把这一切都抛下
	Then we can just leave it all behind.
	一刀两断
	Make a clean break.
	你看着办
	Look, it's up to you.
	无论你怎么做  我都支持你
	I'll be by your side either way.
	游戏一半内容是间谍主题
	So, half the game is a spy thriller.
	你的任务是渗透进苏联监狱
	Your mission is to infiltrate the soviet prison
	拯救挨饿的异见人士  或者...
	and rescue the starving dissident or...
	你也可以扮演一名克格勃狱卒
	You're an elite KGB prison guard.
	你的任务是在美国人带着囚犯逃走前
	Your orders-- find and shoot the American
	找到并杀死他
	before he escapes with your prisoner.
	每一关都可以选择扮演渗透方或者营救方
	So each level can be played as either hide or seek.
	打破我们对于冷战的偏见
	While totally scrambling our cold war preconceptions.
	嗯  就像《高尔基公园》混搭《天狐入侵》
	Right, it's like "Gorky Park" meets "Red Dawn."
	前提是我们可以移植代码
	If we can port the code.
	图像方面  它没有理由
	Graphically, there's no reason
	不能在卡带主机上运行
	it can't run off a cartridge.
	但如果不是双人玩家
	But without the live two-player aspect,
	-它不就是个监狱版《战区》吗  -不
	- isn't it just "Battlezone" in a prison? - No.
	不  我们认为游戏的紧张感
	No, we like to think that the tension
	和幽闭感使它区别于其他游戏
	and the claustrophobia really set it apart.
	酷  太酷了
	Cool. It's definitely cool.
	布莱斯  泡几杯咖啡
	Bryce, a couple of coffees?
	稍等  伙计们
	Um, one second, guys.
	-借过一下  -好的
	- I gotta just go that way. - Oh, sure.
	概念上说  你们的东西很棒
	Look, conceptually, it's really strong.
	只可惜我们付不起你们的开发成本
	I just wish we could cover your development costs.
	你们的报价  超出我们的承受范围了
	What you're asking, it's kind of out of our price range.
	这个...
	well, uh...
	轻松一刻游戏公司
	Funtime Games.
	我觉得我们应该离开这里
	Look, I think we should just get out of here.
	先等等
	Sit tight.
	几位好
	Hey there.
	我是约翰·博斯沃思  来自穆特尼
	John Bosworth, Mutiny, inc.
	布莱斯  能让我们单独谈谈吗
	Bryce, could you excuse us?
	我看看
	Let's see.
	你们的总部在雷蒙德[华盛顿州]啊
	Looks like you're headquartered up in Redmond.
	这是什么  销售网吗
	What is this? Distribution network?
	-那是机密  -覆盖全国呐
	- That's confidential. - That's nationwide, mm-mm.
	背后金主肯定不小
	Gents must have some serious backers.
	博斯沃思先生  我得...
	Mr. Bosworth, I'm gonna have to insist--
	我完全不想
	Oh, hell, I got no interest
	搞砸你们的宏伟计划  无论是什么
	in blowin' your grand plans, whatever they are.
	这是个自由的国家嘛
	Yeah, it's a free country.
	但有几件事想说
	Couple things, though.
	首先  你们没必要冷落我们
	One, well, there ain't no need to cold-room us
	让一个菜鸟来跟我们压价
	with the toddlers just to drive down our price.
	我们是讲道理的人
	Hell, we're reasonable people.
	第二  在友邦旗帜下
	Two, it's a lot easier to
	建立滩头堡要容易得多
	establish a beachhead under a friendly flag.
	你们觉得丰田为什么
	Why do you think Toyota's
	现在要在菲蒙市造汽车而不是在富士什么地方
	building cars in Fremont rather than Fuji-what-now?
	原因就四个字  美国制造
	Well, four little words-- made in the U.S.A.
	你们的合伙人  如果他们推出的产品
	Your partners, say they land their product
	全装着日本游戏
	with strictly Japanese games--
	他们雇你们重新命名包装
	ones they hire you to retitle and repackage--
	听起来有点鬼鬼祟祟  是吧
	Man, that sounds kind of sneaky, huh?
	有点像入侵
	Kind of like an invasion.
	可如果他们搭载点当地的东西
	But say they ship some homegrown titles,
	美国开发的东西
	ones they developed on these shores.
	那就皆大欢喜了
	Boy, that's kumbaya time.
	把手伸过大洋
	Hands across the ocean.
	就算只为公关价值也该买
	Might be worth acquiring for the pr value alone.
	而且  还显得你们聪明  时尚
	Hell, it'll also make you look smart, out ahead of the curve.
	听听我们要说的
	Hear us out.
	你们不会后悔的
	You ain't gonna regret it.
	我们卖掉了
	We sold it.
	那下一步怎么办  他们什么时候付钱
	So, then, what's next? When do we get paid?
	-谁买的  -多少钱
	- Who made the purchase? - How much?
	-5万  -5万
	- 50 grand. - 50 grand?
	足够雇家新网络了
	Enough to hire a new network
	我们还会发一轮工资
	and we will make payroll.
	-穆特尼  穆特尼  -干什么
	- Mutiny! Mutiny! - What?
	-穆特尼  穆特尼  -好吧
	- Mutiny! Mutiny! - Okay, okay, okay.
	穆特尼  穆特尼
	Mutiny! Mutiny!

	有人吗
	Hello!
	恭喜
	Congratulations.
	谢谢
	Thanks.

	其实没有
	No, actually.
	我感觉轻松了
	I feel lighter.
	比之前一段时间思路清晰多了
	I feel clearer than I've been in a while.
	那是什么意思
	What's that supposed to mean?
	公司想要成功  我就得百分百专注
	Look, if this company's gonna survive, it needs me 100% focused.

	- What we've been doing-- - You mean our relationship?
	对
	Yeah.
	我太过满足  幸福了
	I got too complacent and happy.
	我放下了防卫  导致我们受了损失
	I let my guard down and it cost us.
	幸福不是什么副作用
	Happiness is not some side effect.

	- It's kind of the whole point. - Okay.
	我不是在怪你
	I'm not blaming you.
	我是在承担责任
	I'm taking responsibility.
	这是我造成的
	I made this happen.
	其实  我觉得这是乔造成的
	Actually, I think Joe is making this happen,
	我觉得你就是翻不过篇
	and I think you can't get over it.
	或许你一直都没有
	Maybe you never have.
	你利用了我
	You used me.
	你让我相信了我们所做的事
	You made me believe in what we were doing here.
	知道吗
	You know...
	你比自己想的更像他
	You're a lot more like him than you think.

	这是技术活儿
	It's technical.

	对了  有个记者找你
	By the way, a reporter wants a word with you.
	说是你的老朋友
	She says she's an old friend.
	你是来当着几百人羞辱我的吗
	I assume you're here to humiliate me in front of hundreds of people?
	真想啊
	Tempting.
	但是不  这已经没必要了
	But, no, I guess that's no longer necessary.
	是啊  我要走了
	Yeah. I'm done.
	我的生活一完蛋
	I guess when my life goes up in a mushroom cloud,
	我就会自然而然认为是你干的
	I just naturally assume you're behind it somehow.
	习惯了嘛
	Old habits.
	你要走了
	You leaving town?
	是啊
	That's right.
	跟你未婚妻吗
	With your fiancée?
	其实  我们已经结婚了
	Wife, actually.
	去加州本来是我的主意
	Going to California was my idea.
	记得吗
	Remember?

	我差点被你说动了
	You almost convinced me.
	有个跟我亲近的人说  你依然在我的生活中
	Someone close to me said that there must be a reason
	这一定是有原因的
	why you're still a part of my life.
	你想过吗
	Do you ever wonder?
	如果
	I mean, what if
	我们不是
	instead of
	分开执迷地追逐
	chasing what each of us wanted
	各自想要的东西
	separately and obsessively...
	而是抓住彼此会怎样
	We just held on to each other instead?
	我知道你没抄袭我们的界面
	I know you didn't copy our interface.
	我知道那事不怪你
	I know it wasn't your fault.
	我希望你走前能听到我说这话
	I didn't want you to leave without hearing that.
	还有
	And...
	我一定是完全疯了  因为我心里有一部分
	I must be totally mental, because part of me
	根本不希望你走
	doesn't want you to go away at all.
	你根本不知道
	You have no idea...
	卡梅伦  我不能这样
	Cameron, I can't do this.
	不
	No.
	你是乔·麦克米伦  你想做什么都行
	You're Joe MacMillan. I think you can do whatever you want.

	她看到了未来  先到一步
	She saw the future and she got there first.
	这不是我建造的  不是我所有的
	I didn't build this. I don't own it,

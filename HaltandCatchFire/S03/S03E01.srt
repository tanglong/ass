他在唱弗兰克·辛纳屈的歌吗
Is he doing Frank Sinatra?

64
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,630
他唱弗兰克·扎帕我也不在乎
He can do Frank Zappa for all I care.

65
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,290
只要能拖住他就行
As long as it holds him off.

66
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,820

-她  -对  她
- Her? - Yeah, her.

68
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,590
喜怒不定  特别难养
Temperamental, high-maintenance,

69
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,560
只有好生伺候才给好脸色
only responds to the right touch.

70
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,970

Yeah, well, I've been touching this thing for six months

71
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,010
而"他"还是没法运行

00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,770
*洛克菲勒要建大厦  他们都笑了*

办一场庆典
of a working mainframe

84
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,040
那就该等到主机能够启动运行时再办
until the mainframe was actually, you know, working.

85
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,190
博斯让你们快点  记者快等不及了

Still not booting up.

89

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,930
但我们还不能松懈
but we can't slow down now.

146
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,950
我们要继续扩充网上的用户体验
We are continuing to expand user experience on the network...

147
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,510
改进头像  扩建社区
Avatar modification, building out neighborhoods.

148
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,010
大量重要工作最近就得完成了
We have a ton of really important deadlines coming up

149
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,880
全靠各位了
and we are counting on you guys.

150
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,950
我们知道这是多么艰难
We know how hard it was

151
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,530
离开我们德州的亲朋好友
to leave all our friends and family in Texas,

152
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,360
但是你们的付出让我们非常感动
but we are so impressed with your commitment

153
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,130
-我们想...  -说到付出
- and we just want-- - Speaking of commitment,

154
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,760
我要特别感谢一个人
there is one person I would especially like to thank--

155
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,770
我丈夫戈登·克拉克
my husband Gordon Clark.

156
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,670
快上来
Come on up.

157
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,420
戈登
Gordo!

158
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,670
我只想说非常感谢你
I just want to say thank you so much

159
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,830
相信这个疯狂的想法
for believing in this crazy idea

160
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,920
跟我一起在地下室埋头苦干
and slaving away in the basement with me,

161
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,130
没有你我们不可能做到
because we couldn't have done it without you.

162
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,340
我不可能做到
I couldn't have.

163
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,020
好了  来吧  我们继续狂欢
All right, come on, let's get back to the party.

164
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,700
没有你我不可能做到  戈登
I couldn't have done it without you, Gordon.

165
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,920
可不是  没有你的钱不可能做到
Yeah, couldn't have done it without your money.

166
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,340
难以置信
Unbelievable.

167
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,870
这完全是恶意攻击
This is a complete hatchet job.

168
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,580
我知道很难听  但是相信我
I know it hurts, but, trust me,

169
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,000
没有什么报道是糟糕的报道
there's no such thing as bad press.

170
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,520
专业版的报纸风评一败涂地
And the Pro got creamed in the trades

171
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,180
但销量仍是巨人的五倍
and it still outsold the Giant by a factor of five.

172
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,930
不  这不一样  这太糟了
No, this is different. This is bad.

173
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,660
怎么  我猜猜  你要杀了他吗
What, let me guess. You're gonna kill him?

174
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,180
是他列举的事实要我们的命
No, it's his facts that are killing us.

175
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,450
我们的规模是计算机服务的四分之一
We're a quarter of the size of CompuServe,

176
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,540
我们的基础设施比百源少
we have less infrastructure than The Source,

177
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,120
我们的投资预期比科灵可差得多
nowhere near the investment visibility of Q-Link.

178
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,690
我讨厌这文章  但他说得对
I hate it, but he's right.

179
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,460
-怎么样  小家伙  -《家庭马戏团》还是很烂
- What's up, squirt? - "Family Circus" still sucks.

180
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,530
-没错  -别说脏话
- That's true. - Hey, language.

181
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,550
别说脏话
Language.

182
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,790
-琼妮去哪了  -穿衣服
- Where is Joanie? - Getting dressed.

183
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,500
他说你们是新贵  欢迎你们
He calls you upstarts, says you're a welcome addition

184
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,170
给硅谷增添生命活力
of heart and vitality to the Valley landscape.

185
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,960
那家伙...这很好啊
The guy's-- that's great.

186
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,280
他还说我们到88年就得完蛋
Yeah, he's also got us going under by '88.

187
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,570
如果你那么担心
Well, if you're that worried about it,

188
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,360
发个新闻稿  公布各种收益数据
issue a press release full of stats and revenue

189
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,260
讲出你的说法
and, you know, tell your version of the story.

190
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,910
什么  没人看新闻稿
What? No one reads press releases.

191
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,620
他们就看杂志  像这本
They read magazines, like this one.

192
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,010
那我们不如写个讣告得了
Well, then, we might as well write an obituary.

193
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,200
-妈的  -别说脏话
- Oh, shit. - Language.

194
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,600
对不起
Sorry, honey.

195
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,680
我今天4点要见琼妮的校长
I've got to meet with Joanie's principal today at 4:00.

196
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,660
为什么
Why?

197
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,670
她周一打架了
She got in a fight on Monday.

198
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,030
你本打算什么时候告诉我的
Okay, when were you gonna tell me about that?

199
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,160
抱歉  我完全忘了
I'm sorry. Completely forgot.

200
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,510
她起码赢了吧
She win, at least?

201
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,780
校方要找家长
The school wants a parent meeting.

202
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,310
我们4点有个发展会议
Uh, we have a development meeting at 4:00.

203
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,550
-我知道  -他去不行吗
- I know. - So, can't he do it?

204
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,260
好吧  我给你们一点时间
Okay, I'll give you guys a minute.

205
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,160
哇啊
Roar!

206
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,850
哇啊  抓住你了
Roar! Got you.

207
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,570
你刚才完全不知道我在这儿
You totally didn't know I was in there.

208
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,900
嗯  你可是因为
Yeah, well, you're totally busted

209
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,850
在学校打架被抓到了
for the fight you got into at school.

210
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,170
不管  反正我揍扁了她
Whatever. I kicked her ass.

211
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,250
-真的吗  -你弄吧  你知道你想的
- Really? - Go ahead. You know you want to.

212
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,080
什么
What?

213
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,800
你真是个小调皮
You're such a little brat.

214
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,140
我还
And I-- -

215
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,620
我知道你很不爽  我也是
I know you're frustrated. I'm frustrated, too.

216
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,230
我们五个人挤在这里
We're five people living on top of each other, and that's--

217
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,900
唐娜  我不爽是因为这本该是临时的
Donna, I'm frustrated because this was supposed to be temporary.

218
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,370
-这的确是  -不  已经六个月了
- It is temporary. - No, it's been six mo--

219
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,370
该死
Oh, shit.

220
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,850
海莉  亲爱的  到桌子底下去
Haley, sweetheart, get under the table.

221
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,420
琼妮
Joanie!

222
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,720
-妈  -没事了  没事
- Mom! - It's okay, it's okay.

223
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,690
没事了  你还好吧
It's all right. You okay?

224
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,840
-刚才是  -是  别过来  有碎玻璃
- Was that...? - Yes, it was. Hang on, there's broken glass here.

225
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,970
我们该怎么办  去门廊还是出去
What should we do? Should we stay in the doorway or go outside?

226
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,270
你没事  原地别动就行
You're fine. You're fine right where you are.

227
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,130
琼妮  宝贝  你没事吧
Joanie, baby, are you okay?

228
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,120
我没事  别对我大惊小怪的
I'm fine, just don't freak out on me.

229
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,970
抱歉  你觉得那只是小震
Sorry, do you think that was just a preview?

230
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,100
更大的在后面吗
Like a bigger one's coming?

231
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,990
-或者这就完了  -听着
- Or is that the final thing? - Hey, listen.

232
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,910
-你别帮倒忙了  -别这么怂  海莉
- You're not helping. - Don't be such a wimp, Haley.

233
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,270
-琼妮  -你妹妹受了惊吓  态度好点
- Hey, Joanie. - Your sister's scared. Be nice.

234
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,800
-你总是帮她说话  -琼妮
- You always take her side. - Joanie.

235
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,430
大家听着
Hey, listen, guys.

236
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,320
天哪  只是吐司而已啊
Jesus, people, it's toast.

237
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,680
你看上去真炫
My, don't you look out of this world.

238
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,100
是不是很酷
Pretty rad, right?

239
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,290
触角这周刚上线
The antennae just rolled out this week,

240
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,090
还有太阳镜  常规眼镜
along with sunglasses, regular glasses,

241
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,800
以及个性化的莫霍克头
and a Mohawk customization.

242
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,210
你真该弄个莫霍克头
You should totally get the Mohawk.

243
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,020
我们应该走动一下
Oh, we should totally get going.

244
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,900
先去主干道  再去小地方
Let's start with Main Street and then the smaller places.

245
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,390
大锤来了
Oh, there's Sledgehammer.

246
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,150
你听说计算机服务扩展到日本了吗
Did you hear CompuServe's expanding to Japan?

247
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,480
通用电气信息交换网络上季度增加了一万个用户
And GEnie added 10,000 users last quarter.

248
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,280
至少CBS可能会退出特林克斯
At least CBS might back out of Trintex.

249
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,830
真好  那就只剩IBM和西尔斯了
Great, then it's just IBM and Sears.

250
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,220
感觉好冷清啊  是吧
Seems kind of dead on here, doesn't it?

251
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,290
是啊  周二早上9点
Well, yeah, at 9:00 a.m. on a Tuesday

252
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,210
系统就像上午的赌场一样冷清
and the system's like a casino floor in the morning.

253
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,320
只有铁杆粉
It's only the hardcores.

254
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,400
但看看漫画书角
But, hey, look at Comic Book Corner.

255
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,050
小房间的人数
Oh, the niche room metrics

256
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,930
永远是爆表的
are off the charts 'round the clock.

257
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,480
这地方好热闹
That place is rowdy, man.

258
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,820
这里的争吵比地狱天使吧还多
There's more fights than a Hells Angels bar.

259
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,270
幸好这些人的眼镜是虚拟的
Well, I guess it's good that these guys' glasses are digital, then.

260
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,690
真逗  等等
Nice. Oh, hold on a sec.

261
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,950
他有改装开火按钮的1311操纵杆
Guy's got a 1311 with a modded thumbfire button.

262
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,310
天哪  你认识这里的每一个人吗
Jeez, do you know everybody on here?

263
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,530
就是这里了
And then here we are.

264
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,740
6.4万像素  全部有待开发
64,000 pixels of prime, undeveloped real estate.

265
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,970
我们想要它做什么都行
It can be whatever we want it to be.

266
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,150
必须得是
It's got to be--

267
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,070
必须得是非常了不起的东西
it's gotta be something great.

268
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,340
莱恩  怎么了
Ryan. What's up?

269
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,660
抱歉  我无意打扰
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

270
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,810
我们还谈吗  我们说好了是9点
Are we still on? I know we said 9:00.

271
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,500
-还是9点15  -不  就是9点
- Maybe it was 9:15. - No, it was 9:00.

272
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,390
对  是9点  进来吧
Yeah, no, 9:00. Come on in.

273
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,910
我不知道
I don't know.

274
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,350
有另一种方式来看
Okay, here's another way to look at it.

275
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,080
社区就像这样
Community looks like this.

276
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,940
不  应该是这样
No, uh, it looks like this.

277
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,210
不  像这样
Well, no, like this.

278
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:03,330
反正就是聊天之类的
Just-- okay, blah, blah, chatting, chatting, chatting.

279
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,140
我们用精灵单元界面来包装它
We dress it up with a sprite-scaling interface,

280
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,190
但其本质只是数字绘画
but underneath it's just paint-by-numbers.

281
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,880
这里有个房间  去里面聊天
You know, here's a room, chat in it.

282
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,900
{\an8}没那么简单吧
I think it's a little more than paint-by-numbers.

283
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,850
别忘了有意义的人际交流
To discount the meaningful human interaction.

284
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,380
不  它挺好  没啥问题
No, no, no, it works, it's fine.

285
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,260
就像香草冰激凌  但是...
It's like vanilla ice cream, but it's...

286
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,880
这是用户  这是私聊室
So, here are the users and here's private chat.

287
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,520
这些用户在聊天
And the users, they're talking, talking.

288
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,890
"一切都好吗
"Hey, what's going on?

289
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,500
我们增进一下对彼此的了解吧"
Let's get to know each other more."

290
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,720
因此他们选择了私聊
So they go to private chat.

291
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,070
私聊使用的是PETSCII  这是...
And then private chat is just PETSCII because--

292
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,070
{\an3}PET电脑的信息交换标准码

293
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,090
1977年的
1977.

294
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,090
{\an3}PET发售时间为1977年

295
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,780
你妈总会告诉你随手关门吧
You know how your mom always says to close the door behind you?

296
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,740
这两个用户  他们离开聊天室
These two users, they-- they leave,

297
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,290
却不关上门...
and they don't close the...

298
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,300
其他那些人在说
Okay, so, all these other people here are saying,

299
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,200
"你们在干什么呢
"hey, what are you guys doing?

300
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,270
他们要去哪里  我想去看看"
Where are they going? I want to check that out."

301
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,510
他们就跟着去  像这样
And so they-- they go, like that.

302
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,490
所以
And so...

303
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,530
这就是你们的问题
that's your problem.

304
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,210
你们看过《窃听大阴谋》[对话]吗
Have you guys ever seen "The Conversation"?

305
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,150
什么对话
Which conversation?

306
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,520
等等  吉恩·哈克曼那部电影
Wait, the-- the Gene Hackman movie?

307
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,570
没错
Exactly.

308
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,740
人们以为私聊是私密的
People think private chat is private.

309
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,270
但由于某人编写的代码...
But because of the way somebody wrote it--

310
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,730
-是我写的代码  -等一下
- The way I wrote it. - Wait, wait.

311
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,240
你是说有人在黑进私聊里
You're telling me that people are hacking private chats?

312
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,030
是啊  经常的
Sure, um, big-time.

313
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,910
你看
Look.

314
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,110
看见这个小家伙了吗
So, see this little guy here?

315
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,880
这就是那个黑客  身份是隐藏的
That's the hacker. Totally masked.

316
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,110
星号是数据提示符  这个掩盖不了
The asterisk is a prompt for data. You can't mask that.

317
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,300
等等  你怎么拿到这个的
Hold on. How did you get this?

318
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,970
这是私聊抄本
These are private chat transcripts.

319
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,220
简单  我跟着黑客从同一个漏洞进去的
Easy, I just walked through the gaping holes that the hackers did.

320
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,520
-莱恩  -不行  你不能那么做
- Ryan. - No, you cannot do that.

321
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,840
我当然可以  我只是...
Sure, I can. I just--

322
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,550
别再那么做了  真的
Don't do it again. I mean it.

323
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,320
这直接违反了我们的用户协议
That's a direct violation of our user agreement.

324
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,560
好吧  说得没错
Yeah, okay. Um, totally right.

325
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,510
我的想法是这样的
Uh, but here's my idea.

326
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,840
在公共聊天室外将用户连接起来
So, you connect users outside public room,

327
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,570
但首先将他们连到不同的加密节点
but to different encryption points first,

328
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,880
再让他们互相连接
then to each other.

329
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,280
掩盖连接轨迹
You cover tracks,

330
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,270
重新建立
you rebuild private chat

331
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,910
独立于穆特尼的私聊室
separate from Mutiny,

332
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,500
同时又从外部向穆特尼通信
but also still talking to Mutiny outside Mutiny.

333
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,690
是另一个完全独立的穆特尼
Second but separate Mutiny.

334
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,250
用户在这里  这里  和这里
Users here, here, and here

335
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,180
网络  远程  程序  中枢
network, remote, program, hub,

336
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,170
RSA加密  过滤器一  二  三
RSA, filters one, two, three.

337
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,810
没有缓存  搞定
No cache. Voila.

338
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,740
莱恩  这是个全新且昂贵的东西
Ryan, that's an entirely new and very expensive something

339
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,590
运用的技术我们的编程员根本不会  所以...
using techniques that our coders don't even know, so...

340
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,780
我能做  我能做
I can do it. I can do it.

341
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,020
你还有一大堆精灵渲染代码没交给我
You still have a ton of sprite rendering for me.

342
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,030
那就让做不了这个的人去做那个吧
Then put one of the guys who can't do this on it.

343
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,160
莱恩  我们不会做的
Ryan, we're not doing it.

344
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,070
好吧
Okay.

345
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,200
但我还有另一个想法
But here's another idea.

346
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,040
好吧  这样好吗
Okay, you know what?

347
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,250
莱恩  不如你电邮给我们怎么样
Ryan, why don't you just send it to us electronically?

348
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,340
好的
Okay.

349
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,210
好  没问题
Cool. No problem.

350
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,480
很好  我们都很期待你的想法
Great, really looking forward to checking it out.

351
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,990
我要再提一下
Oh, and just to say it one more time,

352
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,150
这种东西对于穆特尼来说
something like this is way better for Mutiny

353
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,470
比给头像加领带好太多了
than putting a bow tie on an avatar.

354
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,570
知道了  谢谢
Got it. Yeah, thanks.

355
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,180
又来了
It's happening again!

356
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,260
前六次还是很好笑的
It was funny the first six times.

357
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,740
谁再玩一次就等着内裤套头吧
Next person that does it is gonna wear their underwear as a hat.

358
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,290
别玩了  白痴
Cut it out, you cretins.

359
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,250
你们每次胡闹
Every time you screw around,

360
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,070
墙屑都会撒落在主机上
it rains down debris on the mainframe.

361
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:31,660
看  现在还有日期了
Look. There's a date now.

362
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,550
兄弟  那就是今天
Dude, that's today.

363
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,580
要我说  肯定是里根搞的鬼
If you ask me, it's got Reagan's fingerprints all over it.

364
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,310
-拜托  -还记得太空激光计划吗
- Jesus. - Hello, remember Lasers in Space?

365
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,650
一开始是因为害怕
Okay, it starts with fear

366
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,690
因为没人想死于核爆
because nobody wants to die in a nuclear blast.

367
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,690
然后  他们一条条地夺走你的权利
And then, one by one, they take away your rights

368
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,380
直到你对里根高呼万岁
until you're Sieg Heilin' Ronnie

369
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,090
并跪舔埃德·米斯and bowing down before Ed Meese.

370
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,090
{\an3}前司法部长

371
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,950
肯定是跟同性恋有关
It's gotta be some gay thing.

372
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,060
像艾滋什么的
You know, like AIDS.

373
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,580
真会说话  兄弟
Real sensitive, dude.

374
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,510
也许是跟宗教有关
Maybe it's a religious thing,

375
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,640
像是帕特·罗伯逊说的世界要再次毁灭了
like Pat Robertson saying the world's gonna end again.

376
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,640
{\an3}传媒大亨
前美南浸信会牧师

377
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,770
一群笨蛋
You idiots.

378
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,270
-是乔·麦克米伦  -什么
- It's Joe MacMillan. - Wait, what?

379
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,890
-不可能  -不会吧
- No way! - Nyet.

380
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,170
这比里根还有意思
Oh, that's better than Reagan.

381
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,320
杀毒那家伙
The antivirus guy?

382
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,100
-你怎么这么肯定  -他们原本是搭档
- How are you so sure? - They were partners.

383
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,660
他真的认识麦当娜吗
Is it true he knows Madonna?

384
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,210
私下认识
Like, really knows her?

385
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,160
我听说他第一个客户是中情局
I heard his first client was the CIA.

386
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,780
不对  那是甲骨文公司
Yeah, no, that was Oracle.

387
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,190
麦克米伦不是偷了你的点子
Didn't MacMillan, like, steal your idea

388
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,640
然后大赚了一笔吗
and make a gazillion dollars?

389
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,660
是啊
Yeah.

390
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,710
但我要起诉他  知道吧
But I'm suing the son of a bitch, aren't I?

391
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,610
没有  我直接睡过去了
No, I slept right through it.

392
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,550
我醒了以后  发现厕所水泼出来点
I woke up and some water had sloshed out the toilet bowl,

393
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,890
但也仅此而已
but that was about it.

394
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,910
但是听我说  特里
But, look, Terry,

395
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,520
我想赶在再大震之前
before the big one hits...

396
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,970
搞定调制解调器的订单
I want to get this modem order sorted out.

397
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,710
没错  V.22
You're damn right, v.22.

398
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,060
给我个批发价吧
Hey, and I want the wholesale number for that.

399
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,260
特里...别这样  老兄
Ter-- oh, come on, man.

400
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,110
我完全可以去街对面的机器人公司
I can walk right across the street to USR

401
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,290
还能很快拿货
and get high-speed transfer for that.

402
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,630
就...
Just--

403
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,630
好吧  你想谈的时候给我打电话
all right, well, call me back when you want to talk,

404
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,440
等你清醒了的  行吗
when you've come to your senses, all right?

405
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,410
多谢
Thanks.

406
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,280
听着  你得...
Look, you need to--

407
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,530
你得给主机室买些设备了
you need to invest in some improvements in the mainframe room.

408
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,260
不然肯定要出事
It's a disaster waiting to happen.

409
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,720
行  你需要咱们就买
All right, whatever you need.

410
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,760
没问题
No problem.

411
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,340
还有别的事吗  戈登
There something else, Gordon?

412
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,680
你是怎么做到的
How do you do it?

413
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,730
你怎么忍得了他们这样胡闹
How do you deal with all this nonsense?

414
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,820
就像在动物园里喂动物
You know, it's like feeding animals at the zoo.

415
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,730
用几块腌鱼就能逗得他们跳舞
Dangle a couple kippers out for them and they dance

416
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,220
让他们安心在笼子里关一整天
and keep them locked up in their cages the rest of the day.

417
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,330
如果你是指那两位丛林女王
You talking about the queens of the jungle,

418
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,720
就另当别论了
that's a different story.

419
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,180
想听建议吗
Advice?

420
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,530
别去妨碍军师团才是上策
I find it wise not to interfere with the brain trust.

421
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,620
这是她们的地盘  我只是个打工的
They run the place. I just work here.

422
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,400
博斯沃思
Bosworth.

423
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,830
男孩还是女孩
Boy or girl?

424
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,160
-什么  -男孩还是女孩
- Excuse me? - Boy or girl?

425
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:30,980
你的孙辈
Your grandchild.

426
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,470
是个男孩
Oh, it's, uh-- he's a boy.

427
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,170
你是谁
Who is this?

428
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,180
你真的忘记我了吗
Come on, did you really forget about me?

429
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,650
-乔  -我只是想说  我为你感到高兴
- Joe? - I just wanted to call and say I'm happy for you.

430
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,170
你怎么拿到...
Hey, how did you even get the--

431
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,520
保重  约翰
Be well, John.

432
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,900
十万用户听起来是不错
Yeah, 100,000 users sounds good,

433
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,120
但问题是他们能在线多久
but what really matters is how long they stay on.

434
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,940
而事实证明
And moving that number

435
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,990
提升在线时长是很难的
is proving a lot more difficult than it looks.

436
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,260
听着
Hey, listen.

437
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,140
弄好主机后
Once I get the mainframe solid,

438
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,920
我想
I was thinking...

439
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,300
我也说不好
I don't know,

440
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,120
我想去找找别的工作
I was thinking about maybe pursuing other opportunities.

441
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,270
3033已经调试好了
We did what we set out to do with the 3033

442
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:27,210
这里也不怎么需要我了
and, come on, there's not really much more for me to do.

443
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,550
好吧
Well...

444
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,870
我希望你能开心
I want you to be happy.

445
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,650
你们是琼妮的父母吧
I'm guessing you two are Joanie's mom and dad.

446
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,910
你是詹妮弗的妈妈吗
Oh, are you Jennifer's mom?

447
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,220
大部分时间是  大家也叫我黛安
Most of the time. People also call me Diane.

448
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,760
你好  我是唐娜
Of course. I'm Donna.

449
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,510
戈登  抱歉
Oh, Gordon, sorry.

450
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,440
就琼妮来说
Look, as far as Joanie goes,

451
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,700
我知道插班生的日子不好过
I know how hard it is to be the new kid in school.

452
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,170
我挺同情她的
She has my sympathy.

453
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,870
但归根结底
But I think what this boils down to

454
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,920
还是因为詹妮弗很生她爸和我的气
is Jennifer is just pretty pissed at her father and me.

455
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,970
我们正在办理手续
We're going through proceedings.

456
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,280
事情不是很顺利
It's been a bit rocky.

457
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,600
手续
Pr-- proceedings?

458
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,010
离婚
Divorce.

459
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,420
我很遗憾
I'm so sorry.

460
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,160
我不觉得  相信我  这样对大家都好
Oh, I'm not. Believe me, it's better for everyone.

461
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,430
除了詹妮弗  她在闹脾气
Except Jennifer, who's lashing out.

462
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,870
总之  我很抱歉
Anyway, so, I apologize

463
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,160
希望没有给你们造成太多困扰
and I hope it hasn't caused you too much grief.

464
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,330
克拉克夫妇  古德太太
Uh, Mr. And Mrs. Clark. Oh, Mrs. Gould.

465
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,720
威尔科克斯校长可以见你们了
Principal Wilcox will see you now.

466
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,880
太好了
Great.

467
00:21:59,010 --> 00:21:59,920
卡梅
Hey, Cam.

468
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,990
你跟别人说起过我孙子吗
Hey, did you tell anyone else about my grandson?

469
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,980
没有  我不该说出来吗
No. Should I not have announced it?

470
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,600
没事  就是问问
Nah, nah. I'm just wondering.

471
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,220
博斯  过来
Hey, Bos. Come here.

472
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,040
干吗
What?

473
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,190
我需要你给莱恩涨个工资
I need you to give Ryan a raise.

474
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,600
给他涨个15%
Just bump him up 15%.

475
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,760
好  这是好主意
All right, that's a good call.

476
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,680
那孩子活儿干得非常好
The kid's been doing a bang-up job.

477
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,910
-是啊  -好
- Yeah. - All right.

478
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,770
我在干活儿呢
Hey, I'm working here.

479
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,970
哥们  我们要去汉堡王
Dude, we're all going to Burger King.

480
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,220
跟我们一起去吃午饭吧
Come to lunch with us.

481
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,300
我带饭了  不用了
I brought today. I'm good.

482
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,160
得了  地下室怪人  你再这样
Come on, this Boo Radley-in-the-basement thing

483
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,670
就有点吓人了
is getting kind of creepy.

484
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,510
一起出去吃点东西嘛
We're offering you a flame-broiled way out of here.

485
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,520
听着  我没时间
Look, I don't have time.

486
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,160
这很重要  好吗
This is important, okay?

487
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,370
不是吧
Seriously?

488
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,620
随你了
Whatever.

489
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,810
简直像个奴隶  他还要开夜车吗
What a slave. What, does he sleep late?

490
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,810
对不起
I'm sorry.

491
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,780
何必  是我在
Why? I'm the one changing

492
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,460
洗手间里换衣服
in the middle of a little girls' room.

493
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,190
再次感谢你这么宽宏大量
Thank you again for being so understanding.

494
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,250
孩子就是孩子嘛
Kids'll be kids.

495
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,840
或许詹妮弗什么时候可以来找琼妮玩
Maybe Jennifer can come play with Joanie sometime.

496
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,550
那就太别扭了  她俩可讨厌彼此
Well, that would be odd considering they don't like each other.

497
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,410
抱歉  我会去找琼妮谈谈的
I'm sorry. I'll talk to Joanie.

498
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,450
我觉得我们养了两个有脾气的姑娘是好事
I like it that we're both raising girls who are fighters.

499
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,600
你说呢
Don't you?

500
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,040
怎么了
What?

501
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,860
我就是很高兴你没被停学
I'm just glad you didn't get suspended.

502
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,080
我知道你觉得自己讨厌加州
I know you think you hate California.

503
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,950
我知道在这里挺不容易的
I know it's-- it's hard here.

504
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,490
但是
But...

505
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,990
我们得下决心
we have to commit.

506
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,150
否则  这里永远不会有家的感觉
Otherwise, it's never gonna feel like home.

507
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,250
整个房子都在晃
The whole house was shaking.

508
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,840
亲爱的  你没事吧
Sweetie, you okay?

509
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,570
我没事
I'm fine.

510
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,280
-真的吗  -没事
- You sure? - Fine.

511
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,990
我们会没事的
We are gonna be okay.

512
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,700
我保证
I promise.

513
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,920
这是涨工资  孩子
It's a raise, son.

514
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,240
你今天走运了
You won today.

515
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,320
卡梅伦和唐娜还说别的什么了吗
Did Cameron or Donna mention anything else?

516
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,050
比你要的少吗
Is it less than you asked for?

517
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,530
我根本没要什么
I didn't ask for anything.

518
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,750
我就是提出了些建议
I just pitched them some ideas.

519
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,160
等时间合适时  她们肯定会来找你的
I'm sure they'll reach out when and if the time is right.

520
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,920
她们肯定会再通知你的
I'm sure they'll let you know.

521
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,430
蓝月亮侦探吗
Blue Moon Detective?

522
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,200
卡梅豪伊
Oh, hey, CamHowe.

523
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,820
很高兴跟你见面
Nice to meet you... in person.

524
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,590
这样认识人怪怪的  是吧
It's weird meeting people this way, isn't it?

525
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,200
就好像你是从我的电脑屏幕上
It's like you jumped out of my computer screen

526
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,210
跳出来的  好像你不是真的
or something, like you're not real.

527
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,980
是啊  穆特尼这方面挺酷的
Yeah, yeah, Mutiny's pretty cool in that...

528
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,770
我没加入多久  我才发现的
I haven't been on long. I only just discovered it.

529
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,100
你呢
How about you?

530
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,400
我在那里工作
I work there, actually.

531
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,780
那肯定挺有意思的
That's gotta be fun.

532
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,710
是啊  其实也不轻松的
Yeah, you know, it's harder than it looks.

533
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,000
是这个吗
Is this the gear?

534
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,550
是的  请便吧
Oh, yeah, yeah. Please go ahead.

535
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,250
应该就在里面
I think it's in there somewhere.

536
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,390
嗯
Oh, yeah.

537
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,730
希望这漆没关系
Hope the paint's okay.

538
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:00,380
没事  他生前是四九人队的球迷吧
Yeah, no, he was a big Niners fan, right?

539
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,880
是啊
Yeah, he was.

540
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,050
你怎么知道的
How do you know about that?

541
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,280
什么
What?

542
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,610
他生前是...
That he was a--

543
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,330
等等  我们提到过他吗
wait, did we talk about him?

544
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,130
-嗯  -我儿子
- Yeah. - My son.

545
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:21,690
是啊  你在哀悼互助聊天室里发过帖子
Yeah, yeah. You posted in the grief and support room.

546
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,440
请节哀顺变
And I'm so sorry for your loss,

547
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,660
但是  操纵杆看上去很好
but the, um, joystick looks great, so--

548
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,200
我们不是在哀悼版块认识的
We didn't meet on the grief board.

549
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,030
是在科技聊天室里
We met in the tech room.

550
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,910
是啊
Right.

551
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,880
我们是在那儿认识的  但我看到
That's where we met, but I saw that you posted

552
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,320
你在哀悼互助聊天室里发的帖了
in the grief and support room and then--

553
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,250
我只发了...
All I posted was--

554
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,560
我只是说我失去了亲人
I mean, I just posted that I had lost someone.

555
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,550
我没提到过...
I never said anything about...

556
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:48,440
我只是跟其他人私聊过他的事
I just had private chats about him with other people.

557
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,520
-没提什么...  -是啊
- Not anything-- - No.

558
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,390
我们没谈到过他  从来没有
We never talked about him, never.

559
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,400
你怎么知道那事的
How-- how the hell do you know about that?

560
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,430
你怎么知道他的
How do you know about him at all?

561
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,230
我...
I...

562
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,230
我该走了
I think I should go.

563
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,830
你怎么知道我儿子的
How do you know about my son?

564
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,720
那些对话不是受隐私保护的吗
Those conversations were supposed to be private.

565
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,440
干吗  你能怪我吗
What, can you blame me?

566
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,720
为了给聊天室增加图形处理能力忙前忙后的
All this to add graphics capability to chat.

567
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,920
只要能让用户在线更久就行
Whatever keeps the users on longer.

568
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,000
很怀疑能奏效多久
Seriously doubt it'll work long.

569
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:01,040
是啊  但这个LZW压缩蛮酷的
Yeah, but this LZW compression is pretty cool.

570
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,310
你真觉得人们会为了动图而多看两眼吗
You really think people are gonna stick around because of GIFs?

571
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:06,160
-那个叫JIF  -少来  是GIF
- It's pronounced "Jif." - No way. Hard G, "Gif."

572
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,470
我听说是JIF  你想说错的随你
I heard "Jif," but it's cool if you want to be wrong.

573
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,700
看啊  是"乔丹"
Hey, look, everyone, it's "Jordon."

574
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,730
你们知道你们的话我在
Hey, you guys know I can hear everything you say

575
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,580
主机室里听得一清二楚吧
down in the mainframe room?

576
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,350
嗯  这个你听得到吗
Yeah, can you hear this?

577
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,610
马蒂  我真替你担心
Marty, I worry about you.

578
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,790
我无意中听到
What I couldn't help but overhear

579
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:26,530
你们为加班而抱怨
is you guys whining about having a long night.

580
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,320
在卡迪夫杀戮室
Back in the Cardiff kill room,

581
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,320
我们开发了一项
we developed a little technique

582
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,260
专门针对熬夜的技巧
for pushing through nights like this.

583
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,340
叫做"混搭提神"
Called it the "Tandy-Shandy."

584
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:37,310
一罐提神  一罐是
One keeps you sharp, and the other's--

585
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,150
啤酒
the other's a beer.

586
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:44,000
我们自己也有技巧
Well, we've got our own technique,

587
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,730
你感兴趣吗
if you're interested.

588
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,660
先生们  这就是给恐龙打飞机的方式
And that, gentlemen, is how you jerk off a dinosaur.

589
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,580
好了  我得去打个电话
All right, now, look, I'm gonna make a phone call.

590
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,790
等我回来  跟我讲讲那姑娘的事
When I come back, I wanna hear about that Amiga.

591
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,870
好吗
All right?

592
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,460
博斯沃思  请留言
Bosworths, leave a message.

593
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,340
儿子  是老爸
Hey there, son. It's Dad.

594
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,420
你现在大概也习惯
I suppose you're getting used to calling yourself

595
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,120
这么称呼自己了吧
that right about now, huh?

596
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,190
真是的  洛克维尔这会儿挺晚了吧
Oh, hell, I bet it's getting late in Rockwall.

597
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:43,910
该死
Dang it.

598
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,850
希望我没把我的小宝贝吵醒了
I hope I didn't wake my little sweet pea up there.

599
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,320
真抱歉我老错过你
I'm sorry I keep missing you.

600
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,270
我就是想听到那孩子的一切
I just want to hear every little detail about that kid.

601
00:30:58,770 --> 00:30:59,980
我意识到我还不知道
It would occur to me I don't even know

602
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,450
他叫什么呢
the little fella's name.

603
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,090
你们想好了吗...
Did you guys decide on one or--

604
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,790
于是
So...

605
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,490
我去了乔家
So I go over to Joe's house,

606
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,170
我还以为这家伙
you know, I'm expecting to see this guy

607
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,930
已经上吊自杀了
swinging from the rafters.

608
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,830
老天爷
Holy shit.

609
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,190
但是  他居然还活着
But, surprise, he's alive.

610
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,310
他打开了门  样子狼狈极了
He opens the door. I mean, he looks like hell,

611
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,770
但他还活着
but he's alive.

612
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:39,130
于是我进去了
So, I go in.

613
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,530
那里已经完全清空了
You know, the whole place is cleaned out.

614
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,530
我看得出  他的整个人生都毁了
And I can see it, his whole life gone,

615
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,860
完蛋了
destroyed.

616
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,780
跟我猜得一样
It's exactly what I had thought,

617
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,670
所以我才整夜没睡
which is exactly why I stayed up all night

618
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,480
逆向索纳里斯的代码
reversing the Sonaris code.

619
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:58,440
老实说  我是真心想帮他
You know, honestly, I really wanted to help him.

620
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,860
所以我出于好心  把光盘给了他
So I gave him the disk out of the goodness of my heart.

621
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,870
我们还拥抱了
We hugged.

622
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,600
乔·麦克米伦还会拥抱
Joe MacMillan knows how to hug?

623
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,910
接下来  我一觉醒来
Next thing you know, I wake up,

624
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,410
就发现他筹资一千万的事
I'm reading about $10 million in financing,

625
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,220
都是靠了我的软件
all based on my software.

626
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,910
太过分了
That's insane.

627
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,620
是啊
Yeah.

628
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,320
他那种人当然会偷你的点子
Of course a guy like that would steal your idea.

629
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,260
他太笨了  自己想不到
I mean, he's too stupid to come up with one of his own.

630
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,610
不不不
No, no, no, no, no.

631
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,720
别那么做
Don't you do that.

632
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,830
别低估他
Don't you underestimate him.

633
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,710
你低估他时  他才最危险
That's when he's most dangerous.

634
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,840
不  乔
No, Joe's...

635
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,440
乔非常聪明
Joe's brilliant.

636
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,090
你如果被他控制住了
And when you're in that guy's thrall,

637
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:50,610
那感觉就像吸毒一样
you know, it feels like a drug.

638
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,970
你会觉得
You know, you-- you feel...

639
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,590
自己是世上最重要的人
like the most important person in the world.

640
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,140
这时候  你就会一觉醒来发现自己被他割喉
And that's when you wake up with your neck slit,

641
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,720
血流了一地
bleeding all over the floor.

642
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,770
那是什么
What is that?

643
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,020
雷的私聊抄本
They're Ryan's private chat transcripts.

644
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,520
他都已经打出来了
He'd already printed them off

645
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,540
我就想  或许能从中找到什么答案
and I figured maybe there'd be some answers in here,

646
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,860
但是  如果我们真挺不过88年呢
but what if we do go under by '88?

647
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,600
我们去年经历的一切
I mean, everything we went through last year,

648
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,080
所有的抗争
all the battles we fought,

649
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:38,530
然后又举家搬迁
moving everything out here, everyone, our--

650
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,150
离开家人和朋友
leaving our families and our friends.

651
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,940
如果我们做了这么多
What if we did all that just to, what,

652
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,060
最终却只能在这儿活跃几年
putter around out here for a couple of years

653
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,920
然后就像
and then disappear like

654
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,150
从没来过一样消失了呢
we were never even here in the first place?

655
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,150
不  搬来这里不是个错误
No, moving here wasn't a mistake.

656
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,990
给我
Here.

657
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,880
这里面肯定有答案的
There's gotta be something in here.

658
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,410
人们下线的理由有很多
Well, there's all kinds of reasons that people are signing off.

659
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,590
聊得太投机
They're getting along so well,

660
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,050
想打电话聊
they want to talk on the phone.

661
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,520
或许这是显然原因
Maybe that's obvious.

662
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:06,060
有时他们甚至想当面见
Sometimes they even want to meet up in person.

663
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,470
或者是想做交易
Or they want to make a trade.

664
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,720
我早些时候去见那个卖操纵杆的人了
I met up with the joystick guy earlier.

665
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,310
那你干吗还买外卖了
Then why did you go to Fry's?

666
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,510
因为  我见到他时
Because when I met up with him in person,

667
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:23,070
才发现他是个变态
he turned out to be a total creep.

668
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,540
线上交易
Transactional interactions?

669
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:47,010
如果你想做交易
Like, what if you didn't have to sign off

670
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,300
也不需线下进行
when you wanted to make a trade?

671
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,020
-你可以  -在网上交易
- You could just... - Do it online.

672
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,180
好吧
Okay, sure.

673
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,600
你是这么做的  但这只是一个原因...
That's just what you did, but that's only one reason--

674
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,850
好吧  我们是不能阻止人们
Okay, look. We're never gonna stop people

675
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,520
煲电话粥的
from talking on the phone, right?

676
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,400
我们也不想那么做
And we don't want to because that's...

677
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,800
因为那才是真正的交心
a genuine connection.

678
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,770
但交易
But with transactions...

679
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,230
看
Here, look!

680
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,030
这是讲私制唱片的
This is about bootlegs.

681
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,640
"我有去年秋天的威尼斯表演"
"I've got the Venice show from last fall."

682
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,370
"我有北部整个夏天的"
"I've got the whole summer up north."

683
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,250
这里又一个
Here's another one!

684
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,170
看  拿我的《85版摔角狂热》
Here. How about my "WrestleMania '85"

685
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,290
换你的汉格勒和赫恩斯《大战》的录像带  好吗
for your Hagler/Hearns "War" VHS?

686
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:26,900
不会都是这个
It's not gonna be every time,

687
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,310
但可能有足够多的交易
but there could be enough of these

688
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,720
值得我们建个线上服务
that it warrants building something

689
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,990
让人们可以在穆特尼上进行这方面交互
so that people are doing this interaction on Mutiny.

690
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,730
就算人们现在没在做线上交易
Even if people aren't already trading,

691
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,770
这也终归是种新的交互形式
it's a brand-new type of interaction

692
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,540
或许能吸引越来越多的用户
that could draw in more and more users.

693
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:40,110
是啊  如果足够好的话
Yeah, yeah. If it's good enough.

694
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,840
必须得做得够好
It just has to be good enough.

695
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,630
好吧
Okay, that's...

696
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,140
这有点意思
That's interesting.

697
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,500
我没见过这种东西
I've never seen that before.

698
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,680
但这是制胜绝招吗
But is this it?

699
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,110
我不知道
I-I don't know.

700
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,420
我也没见过这种东西
I've never seen it before, either,

701
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,720
我们似乎已经见识过不少东西了
and I feel like we've seen a lot.

702
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,650
这样的东西
This could be the sort of thing

703
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,750
或许能真正吸引
that would make people really sit up

704
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,830
人们的注意
and pay attention.

705
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,510
-但这是绝招吗  -是吧
- But is it it? - Right?

706
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,690
因为这必须是绝招
'Cause it needs to be it,

707
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,760
因为我们在这里只有一次机会
'cause we're only gonna get one shot at this out here.

708
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,160
好吧
Well...

709
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,160
主机一切都好吧
Everything okay with the mainframe?

710
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,260
嗯
Yep.

711
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,620
搞定了
Took care of it.

712
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,720
总之  我借此跟程序员们聊了会儿
Anyways, it gave me an excuse to hang out with the coders.

713
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,110
-嗯  -混搭提神吗
- You know. - Tandy-Shandy?

714
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,170
还不止
And then some.

715
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,560
你们在研究什么吗
You guys working on something?

716
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,290
是啊  我们在考虑些想法
Oh, yeah, we were just coming up with some ideas--

717
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,250
交给你们军师团了
I'll leave it to the brain trust.

718
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,570
好吧  他可真怪
Okay, that was so weird.

719
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,300
你觉得怎么样
So, what do you think?

720
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,400
我们试试吧
I think let's do it.

721
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,060
我也这么觉得
Yeah, I think so, too.

722
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,830
但如果想成功
But if this is gonna work,

723
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,720
我们就得信任彼此
we're gonna have to trust each other.

724
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,510
读私人聊天记录违反了我们的用户协议
Reading private chats is a violation of our user agreement.

725
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,140
我们能关闭那个代码里的后门吗
Can we close the back door of that code?

726
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,870
当然
Yeah, sure.

727
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,480
没问题
No problem.

728
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,140
你磕大了
You're high.

729
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,210
你也是
Yeah, so are you.

730
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,250
你一股大学生的味儿  戈登
You smell like Berkeley, Gordon.

731
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:26,550
-我可以去洗洗  -不用
- I could take a shower. - No.

732
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,650
我们的卧室里多久没有大麻味儿了
When's the last time our bedroom smelled like weed?

733
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,740
这就是加州的妙处
That's the great thing about California.

734
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,370
我们的卧室随时可以一股大麻味儿
Our bedroom can smell like weed whenever we want.

735
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,250
恐惧
Fear--

736
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:39,010
是接近真相时的自然反应
it's a natural reaction to moving closer to the truth.

737
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:45,960
自从我成立了麦克米伦实用网络
You know, ever since I started MacMillan Utility,

738
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,470
就一直有人说我在兜售恐惧
I've been accused of selling fear.

739
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,690
但我问问你们
But let me ask you...

740
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,450
是恐惧吗
is it fear?

741
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,790
还是真相
Or is it truth?

742
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,370
我们的立足点究竟有多稳定
How sure is our footing?

743
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,870
昨天早晨  当我们脚下的大地颤动时
Yesterday morning, many of us were reminded of that question

744
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,330
很多人脑中再次浮现出了这个问题
when we literally felt the ground move beneath us.

745
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,490
我们所生活的世界一直在改变
We live in a world that is constantly shifting,

746
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,320
有时候  它将我们聚在一起
sometimes bringing us together

747
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,620
有时候又将我们拆散
and sometimes pulling us apart.

748
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,390
老爸  别担心打来得太晚
Hey, Pop, don't worry about calling late.

749
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,190
我们都放弃睡觉了
We already gave up on sleep.

750
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,020
总之  你会想知道
Anyway, uh, I thought you'd like to know

751
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,500
我们决定叫他萨缪尔·约翰
we are going with Samuel John.

752
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,100
我们的朋友都是谁
Who are our friends?

753
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,420
我们的敌人是谁
Who are our enemies?

754
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,590
我们将会如何
What's gonna happen to us?

755
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,510
我们安全吗
Are we safe?

756
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:08,430
我的创造已有所发展
What I created has grown.

757
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,160
你们中有些人
Now, some of you...

758
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,600
甚至将麦克米伦实用网络称为
...even call MacMillan Utility the gold standard

759
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,480
公司杀毒保护的黄金标准
in corporate antivirus protection.

760
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,300
但同时  我一直在问自己
But in the meantime, I've been asking myself,

761
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:31,260
"安全的代价究竟该有多高
"What should the price of security really be?

762
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,800
我们该花多少钱
How much should we pay

763
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,180
来买安全的感觉"
to feel safe?"

764
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,760
等等  再说一条
Wait, here's another one

765
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,970
传统给我们的启迪
from that same ancient tradition.

766
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:58,990
存在的秘诀就在于无所畏惧
The whole secret of existence is to have no fear at all.

767
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,410
不要惧怕你会变成的样子
Never fear what will become of you.

768
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,670
不要依靠任何人
Depend on no one.

769
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,420
当你拒绝了一切帮助时
Only in the moment that you reject all help

770
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,950
你才真正自由了
are you really free.

771
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,840
只有克服恐惧
Only by moving past fear

772
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:19,390
我们才能获得真相
can we ever arrive at the truth.

773
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:23,310
真相就是  摆脱恐惧是种权利
And the truth is freedom from fear is a right,

774
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,490
而非商品
not a commodity.

775
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:27,840
我知道你们在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

776
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:31,970
我向我的企业客户要价数百万
I charge my corporate clients millions.

777
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,550
他们买得起
Well, they can afford it.

778
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,560
但明天  我将发布
But tomorrow I'm releasing

779
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,320
我们用户版的软件  城堡
our user version, Citadel,

780
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,440
那是我为你们创造的版本
the version I created for all of you.

781
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,110
为你们的个人电脑提供主机级别安全保障
Mainframe-quality security for your personal computer.

782
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,220
等等
Wait, wait.

783
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,580
而且我将...
And I'm charging you...

784
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,520
分文不取
nothing.

785
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,820
为你们
For you...

786
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,670
它是免费的
it will be absolutely free.

787
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,930
麦克米伦先生  我代表《资讯世界》想采访您
Mr. MacMillan, I've got a question from "InfoWorld."

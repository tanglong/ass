00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,240
在我们的网站上  用户已经可以交谈
On our network, users can already have a conversation,

38
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,630
收发电邮  分享信息  交朋友
send mail, share information, connect.

39
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,440
但我们将迈出更大的一步
But this promises to be far more.

40
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,830
这将是世界上首次实现虚拟握手成交
This is the world's first virtual handshake deal.

41
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,750
-一次交易  -这种交易通过电脑完成
- A trade. - A trade made on your computer

42
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,440
让用户可以交换实体物品
that swaps tangible items between users.

43
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,070
不用出门  一切触手可得
You get everything you want without ever leaving your home.

44
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,320
敲击键盘即可完成
You do everything from your keyboard.

45
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,130
唯一需要你打交道的就是快递员
The only person you'll ever see is the mailman.

46
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,130
我们需要一个合适的合作伙伴
We're looking for the right partner.

47
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,080
我们的忠实用户已达十万  而且还在增加
We've currently got 100,000 dedicated users and we're growing,

48
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,900
所以这种规模的扩张需要更大规模的注资
so expansion like this requires another level of funding.

49
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,950
我们需要向程序团队补充更多人手
We need to add more bodies to the coding team,

50
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,310
-强化用户界面并购进...  -多少钱
- enhance our interface, and purchase... - How much?

51
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,690
在我们的计划书最后
In the back of our prospectus

52
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,210
有详细的分析...
you'll find a detailed breakdown of...

53
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,020
我看到了  我只想听你们大声说出来
I saw the number. I'd just like to hear it said out loud.

54
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,070
140万
$1.4 million.

55
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,910
我们的用户群很忠实
Our base is loyal

56
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,190
且取得成功后成本才会增加
and costs only rise in success.

57
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,910
所以我们的客户流失率  见第25页
So our churn rate, page 25,

58
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,570
和消耗率  见第26页
and our burn rate, 26,

59
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,680
都低到基本可以忽略
are practically nonexistent.

60
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,650
光是第一年  我们相信穆特尼易物
In its first year alone, we believe Mutiny Exchange

61
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,080
交易量将会超过50万笔
will see upwards of a half a million deals.

62
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,050
今天我们想把这笔开门交易给您来做
Today, we're offering you the opportunity to make the first one.

63
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,040
没说错吧  麦克
Told you, Mac.

64
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,130
还真是  果然是一流
You were right. First-rate.

65
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,420
近一段时间以来最精彩的了
best I've heard in a while.

66
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,470
为什么拖到这么晚才来找我
Why am I one of the last to hear it?

67
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,000
因为我们在分析风投市场的行情
Because we've been assessing the vc landscape...

68
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,140
我听说你们拿着这个找了好几家风投了
I've heard you've been up and down Sand Hill Road with this.

69
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,930
我们是新手  急需投资
Well, we're new in town. We're hungry

70
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,710
所以急于寻找合伙人
and we want to move fast.

71
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,220
我理解
Okay, I get that.

72
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,510
86年第二季度我们一共投了27家公司
Our portfolio is 27 companies deep as of q2 '86.

73
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,340
我们投资了3com和思科  还有
We are in on 3com and Cisco and...

74
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,530
糟了  蒂姆  我想起来了
Shit, Tim, that reminds me,

75
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,040
我还得给桑蒂[思科创始人]回电话
I gotta call Sandy back.

76
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,310
你投资回报最好的是甲骨文
One of your best was Oracle.

77
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,840
上个月首募200万股  每股55块
Ipo'd last month, two million shares, $55 a pop.

78
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,320
确实  拉里让我们赚了5500万
Sure did. Larry made us $55 million.

79
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,170
你是说你也能做到吗
Are you telling me you could do the same?

80
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,900
从5500万里借140万给我  赚给你看
Well, lend us 1.4 of that 55 and we'll show you.

81
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,930
我们过去吃过亏
We've been burned in the past.

82
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,240
我们入场出手
We will throw our hat in the ring

83
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,130
报价却被人满世界宣扬
only to have our offer shot up and down the valley.

84
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:34,870
我不喜欢玩虚的
I don't like games

85
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,520
更不喜欢被人当成抬价的筹码
and I don't want to be used as a stalking horse.

86
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,070
如果我们同意投资  跟你们签了风投协议
If we were to move on this and give you a term sheet,

87
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,030
你们就不能再找别家
we'd want a no-shop in return.

88
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,870
不想做生意我们也不会来了
We wouldn't be here if we weren't ready to do business.

89
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,690
打扰一下  麦克米伦先生
Excuse me, Mr. MacMillan, sir.

90
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,820
能占用你一点时间吗
If I can have a moment of your time.

91
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,070
先生
Sir.

92
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,090
三千分之一
3,000 to one.

93
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,950
这是一生中被雷电击中一次的几率
Those are the odds of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime.

94
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,630
也是被网络病毒攻击的几率
They're also the odds of getting hit by a computer virus.

95
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,440
但是只要五年左右  这几率就会大幅提高
But in, like, five years, those odds are gonna go way up.

96
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,160
我是说病毒  不是雷击
For... for viruses, not lightning.

97
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,880
所以你的工作才无比重要
But that's why your work is so critical.

98
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,400
因为人们都只盯着眼下
Because people are focused on today

99
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,480
你已经放眼未来了
and you're already into tomorrow.

100
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,040
-你有名字吗  -当然  我叫莱恩
- Do you have a name? - Yeah, of course. It's Ryan.

101
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,140
莱恩·雷
Ryan Ray.

102
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,100
莱恩  海水现在只有11度
Ryan, it's 52 degrees in that water.

103
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,940
等我换点干衣服的
I'm gonna get into some dry clothes.

104
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,290
我为穆特尼工作
I work for Mutiny

105
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,600
和卡梅伦·豪伊还有戈登·克拉克
with Cameron Howe and Gordon Clark.

106
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,440
麦克米伦实用网络就是稍加修饰的索纳里斯病毒
MacMillan Utility is basically sonaris virus with lipstick.

107
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,480
452千行代码中只有两千行不同
And only two klocs out of 452 separate it.

108
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,790
而这两千行代码完全改变了
And those two klocs completely changed

109
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,060
整个程序的作用和目的
the functionality and purpose of the entire program.

110
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,070
实在太厉害了
It's completely amazing.

111
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,330
而且  我用了不到一天就拆解出来了
And, you know, I pulled it apart in less than a day.

112
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,460
是想震撼我吗  莱恩
Trying to impress me, Ryan?

113
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,560
是的  差不多就是个目的
Uh, yeah, that was sort of the point.

114
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,320
能问你个问题吗
Can I ask you a question?

115
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,730
当然  随便问
Yeah, sure, anything.

116
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,890
海湾有13个点可以冲浪
The bay area has 13 breaks worth surfing.

117
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,760
找到我之前你去了几个
How many did you go to before you found me?

118
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,390
说实话吗  4个
Honestly? Four.

119
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,150
11个
11.

120
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,520
12天了  还是那个样
12 days and the same old song and dance.

121
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,250
他还在做麦克的工作
He's still working on Mac.

122
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,310
好吧  要么蒂姆在嘴炮  要么就没啥本事
Okay, so then Tim's either full of shit or he's got no juice.

123
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,390
哈珀是我们最后的希望
Harpor was our last shot.

124
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,010
我们还有一些会面
We've got a couple more meetings,

125
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,060
但都是些小公司
but they're smaller boutique firms.

126
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,370
要是我们第一轮筹款就到处被拒
If we get denied first-round funding across the board,

127
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,880
那不管我们接下来做什么
then it'll be impossible to get that stink off

128
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,220
都很难摆脱这个形象了
no matter what we do next.

129
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,210
我不明白  这个主意很棒
I don't get it. The idea is great.

130
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,810
每场面谈的计划书都很出彩
The prospectus kicks ass every meeting we've gone into.

131
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,400
14个风投公司没一个愿意接  为什么呢
14 VC firms and nobody's stepped up, why?

132
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,260
这些混蛋就爱晾着你
Well, these clowns love to make you wait.

133
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,710
他们觉得这让自己显得更有吸引力
They think it gives them some kind of an allure.

134
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,080
但只要有一个邀你去舞会就够了
But it just takes one of them to ask you to the dance.

135
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,910
老天爷  这一行打比方都这么性别歧视
God, I love how even the metaphors in this business are sexist.

136
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,900
我们可以拿出各种数据和事实
We can hit them with all the data and all the hard facts we want,

137
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,940
但我们一走进去  他们只能看到一件事
but the minute we walk in there, they still see just one thing.

138
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,090
你们别总想着是自己的原因嘛
You guys can't take this stuff so personally.

139
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,360
但我们就是这家公司
But this company is us.

140
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,960
别急嘛
Well, just give it time.

141
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,990
博斯  这几周没一个投资人联系我们
Bos, we haven't heard back from a single investor in weeks.

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,410
那你要我说什么
What do you want me to say?

143
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,620
你们俩是女人这一事实
Look, the fact that you two are women

144
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,430
确实不是什么加分项
I'm sure doesn't help matters.

145
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,310
我倒宁愿你继续骗我们
I think I liked it better when you were lying to us.

146
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,970
那些风投都是笑面虎
These smiling VCs out here

147
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,650
就喜欢笑嘻嘻地搞死你
love to grin and screw you, don't they?

148
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,460
德克萨斯起码还明刀明枪
At least in Texas they stab you in the front.

149
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,230
怎么了
What?

150
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,860
哈珀资本的蒂姆·汉克尔
Tim Hankel from Harpor Capital.

151
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,760
蒂姆  麦克回复你了吗
Tim, hey, have you heard from Mac yet

152
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,090
还是我该继续打电话
or do I have to keep calling you

153
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,460
直到你对我们下限制令
until you take out a restraining order on me?

154
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,180
我知道
Ha, I know, I know.

155
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,880
抱歉拖了那么久  但都是值得的
I'm sorry it's taking so long, but it was worth it.

156
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,890
说好了
We are a go.

157
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,590
我说了会拉麦克进来  我说到做到
I told you I'd get Mac on board and I'm a man of my word.

158
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,230
他刚从阿斯彭回来  但明天就飞洛杉矶
He just got back from Aspen, but he's off to LA tomorrow,

159
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,410
他希望走之前把事情都打点好
So he wants something in place before he leaves.

160
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,300
方便今晚聊聊初步计划吗
You two free to talk first steps tonight?

161
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,860
好  我们查查日程安排再回复
Yes, let me check my schedule and get back to you.

162
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,520
不用转向语句就可以
No, you can do that without the goto statements.

163
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,080
不必要的跳转能省则省
And it's always better without spaghetti branching.

164
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,030
结构化程序  伯姆-贾可皮尼定理
Structured programing. Bohm-Jacopini style.

165
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,110
伯姆-贾可皮尼  好嘞
Bohm-Jacopini. You got it.

166
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,890
嗯  我会写下来的
Yeah, I'll write it down.

167
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,430
闲庭信步  无所事事  西装革履
Walking the floor, not really working, wearing a tie.

168
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,220
你想进管理层吗
You looking to become management?

169
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,490
什么  非也
What? No, no.

170
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,270
我今天还有一场取证
I got another bullshit deposition today.

171
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,240
明天还得去
Going in tomorrow, too.

172
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,600
起诉麦克米伦的案子吗
MacMillan lawsuit?

173
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,420
没错
Yep.

174
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,130
这个月都三次了
That's three already this month.

175
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,150
是不是很可怕
Is that intimidating?

176
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,800
在乔·麦克米伦直瞪瞪的眼神下接受盘问
Getting grilled with Joe MacMillan staring at you with those eyes of his?

177
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:17,420
他不在现场  只有我和律师
No, he's not there. It's just me and the lawyers.

178
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,130
无聊多于残酷
More boring than brutal.

179
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,700
他们不断问你同一个愚蠢的问题
You know, they ask you the same stupid questions over and over,

180
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,060
指望你出错
hoping you'll slip up.

181
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,100
我就盼着快点了事
Give anything if it was to be over

182
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,890
好赶紧拿支票走人
so I can collect the damn check already.

183
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,830
那真不错  你最好先把领带上的玉米片弄掉
That'd be sweet. Better brush the nacho dust off your tie first.

184
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,150
好了  先生们
Okay, gentlemen.

185
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,590
先生们  又到每周例会时间了  
Gentlemen, it's that time of the week again.

186
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,870
我懂  我也很高兴
I know. I love it, too.

187
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
好了  关于你们的供应需求  得说明白点
All right, I need some clarification on your supply needs.

188
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,320
因为上次有点误解
Because, well, there was a bit of confusion last time.

189
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,890
我们买入2400调制解调器后
After we made the deal with Hayes for the 2400s,

190
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,670
我收到了执行部的电话
I got on the phone with the fella from fulfillment

191
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,870
问我要不要那些附加的RS-232串口设备
and he asked if I wanted those additional RS-232 cables

192
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,410
受你们英明的指教  我回答说
to which I, per your wise instruction, reply,

193
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,810
"不  先生  那不是我要的那种机器人"
"No, sir, those are not the droids that I'm looking for."

194
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,620
于是他笑破肚皮之后
So after he got done laughing his ass off,

195
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,130
他解释说肯定有人在戏弄我
he explained that someone must be messing with me.

196
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,020
干得好  孩子们  我很感激
Well done, boys. I appreciate it.

197
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,190
继续
Moving on.

198
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,870
好了  我需要了解你们正在做的
All right, I need an update on the graphics extension

199
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,140
穆特尼易物演示系统的图形扩展的进度
for the Mutiny Exchange demo y'all are working on.

200
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,440
以及它将如何与周围已有的图形处理组件相连
And how it will interface with existing neighborhood graphics.

201
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,380
精灵引擎差不多弄好了
We have the sprite engine mostly working,

202
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,290
但是扫描线渲染还有点问题
but we still have a problem with the scan line rendering.

203
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,720
对  拼接地图缺失缓存
Yeah, we're getting a tile map cache miss,

204
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,070
所以调色板不同步
So we're losing synchronization on the palette.

205
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:39,700
好的  等等
Okay, well, hold it.

206
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,320
调色板连接的问题...
So is the thing with the palette connected to the...

207
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,910
就像我上次说的
As I said last time...

208
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,630
我们应该在位图上用位块传送器
...We should be using a blitter on a bitmap

209
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,170
这样才能在软件中来做
so we can do it in software

210
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,500
而不会让那些
and not freeze out devices

211
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,270
不支持硬件精灵的设备死机
that don't have support for hardware sprites.

212
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,600
好的  慢点  大家都同意吗
Okay, slow down. Slow down. Are we in agreement here?

213
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,120
你这是完全改变思路
You're talking about a whole new change of course.

214
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,610
没关系  把我们说的写下来就好
Doesn't matter. Just scribble down what we say,

215
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,490
交给卡梅伦  她能看懂
Give it to Cameron, she'll understand what we're talking about

216
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,160
别浪费我们的时间了
and stop wasting our time.

217
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,080
我不确定我都听懂了
You know, I'm not sure I got all that.

218
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,120
有时候我有点迟钝
See, sometimes I'm a bit slow.

219
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,990
需要别人跟我重复一遍
Need things repeated to me twice.

220
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,360
你干吗不站起来当面跟我说呢
Why don't you stand up and say that to my face?

221
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,440
你想站起来  对我重复一遍吗
You want to stand right up and repeat that to my face, son?

222
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,620
博斯  你有时间吗
Hey, Bos. Bos, you got a sec?

223
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,660
很快就好  博斯
Real quick. Bos.

224
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,990
听着  我知道你讨厌开这些会
Hey, listen, look, I know you hate these meetings.

225
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,530
跟前列腺检查比起来
Oh, yeah, compared to a prostate exam,

226
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,700
我还算喜欢的
no, I positively love them.

227
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,620
-我不擅长这个  戈登  -我懂
- Look, this is not my forte, Gordon. - I understand.

228
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,050
-姑娘们都没空  但卡梅伦说  -好
- The girls got their plates full, but Cameron says... - Okay, okay,

229
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,610
-博斯  你想来...  -我来搞定他们
- "Bos, you want to come in"... - Let me run them.

230
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,480
好吧  我懂他们的行话
Okay? I speak their language,

231
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,150
他们不会糊弄我  效率也更高
so they can't mess with me and it could be more efficient.

232
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,410
我不是想越权
Look, I'm not trying to step on your toes...

233
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,150
有问题再来找我
Wake me if there's a problem.

234
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,550
-戈登  -怎么
- Gordon. - Yeah?

235
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,920
谢谢你挺我
Thanks for having my back.

236
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,530
没什么
Yeah, sure.

237
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,480
听着
Listen...

238
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,290
我知道作为一群人里最聪明的那个是什么感受
I know what it's like to be the smartest guy in the room

239
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,310
我也知道试图证明这点就是浪费时间
and I also know it's a waste of time trying to prove it.

240
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,980
用你的工作来证明
Let your work speak for itself,

241
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,410
而且要知道
and be open to the possibility

242
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,850
那些不理解你的人
that people that don't understand you,

243
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,240
未必就是想妨碍你
they're not necessarily trying to get in your way.

244
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,650
如果没人看我的成果  要怎么证明
How can I if no one can see the work?

245
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,170
我有想法
I have ideas.

246
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,650
好想法
Real ideas.

247
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,390
可能听上去很理论化
They might sound theoretical,

248
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,210
但我可以把它变成现实
but I can make them happen.

249
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,650
我告诉了卡梅伦和唐娜  但她们听都不听
I told Cameron and Donna, but they didn't even listen.

250
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,070
她们只是让博斯给我钱让我住嘴
They just had Boz pay me to shut up.

251
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,340
什么想法
What ideas?

252
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,630
在回小屋的路上
On the way back to the lodge,

253
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,740
唐金斯说  我们做雪天使吧
Dawkins says, "Let's make snow angels."

254
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,200
他躺在雪地上  伸开双臂
He lies down in the snow, sticks out his arms,

255
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,350
然后醉晕了过去
and then passes out just drunk as a skunk.

256
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,250
在剩下的旅途中我们都叫他雪耶稣
We called him snow jesus the rest of the trip.

257
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,490
很高兴你滑雪滑得很开心
Okay, glad you had a good ski thing.

258
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,660
蒂姆说你想讨论初步计划
Tim said that you wanted to discuss first steps.

259
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,680
-我跟你说实话  -好
- I want to level with you. - Okay.

260
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,800
-你们听说AT&T砍掉视特灵了吧  -是
- I'm sure you heard about AT&T axing Viewtron. - Oh, yeah.

261
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,090
有些人觉得那就是网络报刊的终结
Some folks in town think that is the end of online newspapers,

262
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,030
但我了解
But I have got some insight

263
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,800
奈特里德集团内部的真正情况
into what's really going on over at Knight Ridder.

264
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,240
我觉得他们错失了真正的机遇
And I think that just real opportunity is being vacated there.

265
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,260
也就是说
Which means?

266
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,050
也就是说我要在可视图文上投大钱
Which means I'm gonna go in big on videotex.

267
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,040
我们的可用资金就会减少
It's gonna tie up more of our capital,

268
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,530
也就是说我无法投资140万
which also means I don't think I can do 1.4.

269
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,540
抱歉
I'm sorry.

270
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,070
那么
Oh, so...

271
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,160
这是拒绝了
It's a pass, then.

272
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
不  等等  这不是非黑即白的事
No, hold on. It's not that black and white.

273
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,350
我们还是想把你们加入到投资组合中
We still want you in the portfolio.

274
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,420
你们的想法有很大潜力
Your concept has just great potential.

275
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,000
说实话  你们两个人
And, honestly, the two of you,

276
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,420
真的很聪明
really sharp.

277
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,840
谢谢  但
Oh, thank you, but...

278
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,220
蒂姆  你来给她们解释一下吗
Tim, you want to walk them through it?

279
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,420
好  我们不能投140万
Yeah, okay, so we can't do 1.4,

280
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,040
但如果我们把穆特尼易物
but what if we aim for a leaner,

281
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,770
变得更加精简呢
meaner Mutiny Exchange?

282
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,860
-你是说更便宜吗  -不  更精巧
- You mean cheaper? - No, smarter.

283
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,730
以小做大
Doing more with less.

284
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,510
比如  我认为你们
Like, for instance, I think you can make do

285
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,630
需要雇的新员工
with half as many new hires

286
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,200
有计划书里的一半就够
as you have laid out in the prospectus.

287
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,050
对  你们可以不做服务器升级
Yeah, and I think you can skip the server computer upgrades,

288
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,420
至少暂时不做
at least initially.

289
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,410
更少风险  更多回报  行之有效
Less risk, more reward. It's a surefire way to go.

290
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,480
听上去不错吧
Does that sound good?

291
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,530
我们先停一下
You know, let's just hold off on the...

292
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,010
先等一下
Just for a second.

293
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,950
我听到的是你们想通过仅投资
What I'm hearing is that you want to lock us up

294
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,090
我们所需数目的一小部分来锁死我们
by investing a fraction of what we're asking.

295
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,110
不  你误解我们的意思了
No, you're misinterpreting what we're saying.

296
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,460
甲骨文也是这么来的
Oracle was the same deal.

297
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,670
投资会不断增加
Investment grew over time.

298
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,410
现在都是这样
It's how things get done out here.

299
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,700
好  那你们要给我们多少钱
Okay, so then how much money are you offering us?

300
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,290
我们还在考虑
That is a number that we are still trying to figure out.

301
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,330
今天的意义就在此  我们开始商谈
That's what this was all about, getting the ball rolling,

302
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,290
假设你们肯接受建议
assuming that you are amenable.

303
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,600
我们为此花了很多精力
Well, we've put a lot of thought into this

304
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,840
真没要求什么多余的资金
and there really isn't much fat.

305
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,610
其实根本就没有可减的部分
Yeah, you know, there's no fat.

306
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,420
在硅谷  你俩是新人
Well, ahem, you two are new to the valley

307
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,660
我知道你们想立马拿到你们想要的一切
and I know you want everything that you want right away.

308
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,180
但事实上  投资就像网球双打  
But out here, funding is like doubles tennis.

309
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,620
你得了解你的伙伴
You got to know who you're partnering with.

310
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,220
你们能互相信任吗
Can you trust each other?

311
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,250
你们俩在一起能打好吗
Do you play well together?

312
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,040
合不合适呢
Is it a good fit?

313
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,690
这些无法通过一次会面或仅仅一顿晚餐
And that's not easy to know after just one meeting

314
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,470
就轻易了解
or even over dinner.

315
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,420
嗯  听着
Yeah, listen,

316
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,730
我们都知道这个行业
we both know that success

317
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,560
能否成功取决于时效性
in this industry comes down to timing.

318
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,390
我们必须第一个进入市场
We have to be first to market,

319
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,050
没有足够的资金
and without sufficient funding,

320
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,220
我们做到的可能性就大打折扣
our ability to do so is seriously compromised.

321
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,330
那对我们都没好处
And then we all lose.

322
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,330
我明白  但我们
I hear that, but let's just...

323
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,610
先缓缓
just take a beat,

324
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,310
好好吃晚餐  看看接下来会怎么样
enjoy our meal, see how the evening goes.

325
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,420
或许明早我会
And then maybe I will look into cutting you

326
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,950
给你们开张很有诚意的支票
a good-faith check in the morning.

327
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,290
我出去打个电话
I'm gonna pop out for a call.

328
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,820
你们考虑考虑
Just think it over.

329
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,200
我以为这是严肃的会面
I thought this was a serious meeting.

330
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:28,990
我们很严肃
We are serious.

331
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,700
刚才那是怎么回事
What the hell was that?

332
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,780
那是个机会
It was an opportunity

333
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,910
能让你们脱颖而出
for you guys to jump to the front of the line.

334
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,030
那难道不是你们想要的吗
Isn't that what you wanted?

335
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,510
如果他有什么误会的话  我道歉
Wow, okay, my apologies if he misread things.

336
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,690
怎么可能误会
What could he have possibly misread?

337
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,800
我们一直表现得很专业
We have been nothing but professional.

338
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,140
你开玩笑吧  两周来你们每天都打电话
Are you kidding? You guys call every day for two weeks.

339
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,880
他一打给你们  你们就放下一切来赴宴
You drop everything the night he calls you to dinner.

340
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,670
抱歉  但涂了那种颜色的口红
And I'm sorry, but nobody wears that shade of lipstick

341
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,230
就该是玩得起的
unless they have come to play.

342
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,590
我们要走了
We're going.

343
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,700
不行  我要告诉他...
No, you know what? I'm going to tell him...

344
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,170
我们的光盘不能只出现在
I want our discs available beyond stores

345
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,640
计算机商店里
aimed at the computer crowd.

346
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,340
如果大家找不到  免费又有何意义
What's the point of making something free if no one can find it?

347
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,180
别那么死板  
Listen, be creative.

348
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,650
我们的目标是刚使用计算机的用户
We're after first-time PC users.

349
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,770
我们应该出现在杂货店  音像店  商场
We should be in grocery stores, video stores, malls.

350
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,340
我们要无处不在
We want to be everywhere they are.

351
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,020
我希望人们看腻了我们
I want people sick of seeing us

352
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,660
就像我不想再见到你们一样  去吧
the same way I'm sick of seeing you. Go.

353
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,650
辛西娅
Cynthia!

354
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,690
-你是莱恩·雷吗  -是的
- Are you Ryan Ray? - Yeah.

355
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,920
麦克米伦先生要见你
Mr. MacMillan will see you.

356
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,240
这一周每天上午9点
Every day this week at 9:00 a.m.,

357
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,630
我都有与莱恩·雷见面的安排
I've got a meeting scheduled with Ryan Ray.

358
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,640
你做这个花了多长时间
How long did this take you?

359
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,770
两个小时
Two hours.

360
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,750
好  你见到我了
Okay, you're here.

361
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,970
为了见我一面你花了不少功夫
You've gone to a lot of trouble to be here.

362
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,030
我给你三分钟时间
You've got three minutes.

363
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,330
那我就开门见山了
Okay, then I'll cut to the chase.

364
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,440
我想在麦克米伦实用网络工作
I want to work at MacMillan utility.

365
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,950
"我想"和"我得"有很大区别
Want is very different than need.

366
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,180
好吧  我得在这里工作
Okay, I need to work here.

367
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,190
为什么
Why?

368
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,530
因为我对杀毒软件很感兴趣
Because I'm fascinated by antivirus software.

369
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,270
我没兴趣  我觉得无聊
I'm not. It bores me.

370
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,090
好吧  因为你设立了标杆
Okay, um, because you set the gold standard

371
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,670
还在寻找下一个挑战
and you're looking for your next challenge.

372
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,410
我也一样
I am, too.

373
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,400
你凭什么认为自己知道我想要什么
What makes you think you know what I'm looking for?

374
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,140
我不知道
I don't.

375
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,340
是啊  那太冒昧了  只有你自己才知道
Yeah, that was presumptuous. Only you know that.

376
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,000
你凭什么认为我知道自己想要什么呢
What makes you think I know what I'm looking for?

377
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,310
因为你很厉害  等等  你不知道吗
Because you're brilliant. Wait, don't you?

378
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,580
你不必回答这个问题
I mean, you don't have to answer that.

379
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,090
你凭什么要回答呢  我不过是...
Why would you? I just...

380
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,190
无论你下一步做什么  我都要加入
Whatever you want to do next, I'm in.

381
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,480
这是一场测试  我给出了错误答案  是吗
This is a test and that was the wrong answer, right?

382
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,490
这是一场测试  我给出了正确答案
This is a test and that was the right answer?

383
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,150
我不知道你想让我说什么
I don't know what you want me to say.

384
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,210
你来到这里真正想说的
Whatever you actually came here to say.

385
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,290
我觉得我还没听到呢
I can't imagine that I've heard it yet.

386
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,720
我觉得你不喜欢我  我说什么都不要紧
I feel like you're judging me. It doesn't matter what I say.

387
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,440
即使你不说话  也看上去很失望
Even when you're not talking, you seem disappointed.

388
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,220
你可以问我天空是什么颜色
You could ask me what color the sky is

389
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,310
即使我说蓝色也会是错的
and I would say blue and somehow I'd be wrong.

390
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,290
确实  现在是阴天
You would be. It's overcast.

391
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,940
是你提携了默默无名的戈登·克拉克
You plucked Gordon Clark out of obscurity, right?

392
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,660
在他遇见你之前  什么都不是
He was nothing before he met you.

393
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,210
我认识他  我跟他一起工作
I know him. I work with him.

394
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,660
你老这么说
So you keep saying.

395
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,000
我跟他一样好
I'm just as good as he is

396
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,210
而且更努力  主动 
and a hard worker with initiative.

397
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,300
我知道你冲浪  所以我连续两周
I learned you surfed, so I woke up at 5:00 in the morning

398
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,800
每天凌晨5点起床  找了11片海滩才找到你
for two weeks straight and cased 11 beaches to find you.

399
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,210
我黑了一家安全公司
I hacked a security company.

400
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,400
你的安全公司
Your security company.

401
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,290
这难道不能证明...
Doesn't any of that prove that...

402
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,900
好吧  这听起来可能会很奇怪
Okay, this is gonna sound weird,

403
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,350
我自己说出来也觉得很可笑
and I feel ridiculous even saying this,

404
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,340
但我知道有事要发生
but I know that something's coming.

405
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,310
大事
Something big.

406
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,850
像是一列火车  而我只想跳上去
Like a train and all I want is to jump on board.

407
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,860
但它开得越来越快
But it's getting faster and faster

408
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,860
我害怕自己会错过它
and I'm terrified that I'm gonna miss it.

409
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,160
你在卡斯特罗剧院演讲的那晚
That night... that night that you spoke at the Castro,

410
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,340
我就觉得  终于
I was like, finally,

411
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,840
有人和我的想法一样
somebody sees the world the way I do.

412
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,950
那时我就知道  这就是我的火车票
And I knew right then that this was my ticket on that train.

413
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,630
我不知道还能告诉你什么
I don't know what else to tell you, man.

414
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,920
我只想和你共事...我必须得和你共事
I just want to work with you... need to work with you.

415
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,760
做什么都好
On anything.

416
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,310
求求你了
Please.

417
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,880
没人听我的话
Nobody listens to me.

418
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,730
没人认真对待我
No one takes me seriously.

419
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,740
我不想被落下
I don't want to get left behind.

420
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,630
你的三分钟到了
Your three minutes are up.

421
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,340
你看起来很好
You look great.

422
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,090
克拉克女士  豪伊小姐
Mrs. Clark, Miss Howe.

423
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,000
请跟我来
Follow me.

424
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,390
谢谢
Thank you.

425
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,210
这边走
We're just going right down there.

426
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,380
谢谢
Thank you.

427
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,400
-好了  -该坐吗
- Okay. - Should we sit?

428
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,370
你们好
Hello.

429
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,960
-黛安  -唐娜
- Oh, Diane. - Donna, hi.

430
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,660
天啊  我好笨
Oh, my god, I feel so stupid.

431
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,880
我没想到你就是阿马多·古德·吉尔森的合伙人
I had no idea you were the Gould in Amador Gould Gilson.

432
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,840
世界真小  这里更小
Small world. Smaller valley.

433
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,320
太好了  我们不用浪费时间
But this is great. Now we don't have to waste time

434
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,180
寒暄闲聊了
exchanging pleasantries or small talk.

435
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,960
这位是...
Except for...

436
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,360
卡梅伦·豪伊
Yes, Cameron Howe.

437
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,190
黛安是琼妮同学的妈妈
Oh, Diane is a mom at Joanie's school.

438
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,210
好的
Okay.

439
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,890
等等  是被琼妮打了的那个女孩的妈妈吗
Oh, wait, the mom of the girl that Joanie beat up?

440
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,440
我听说是个平手
I heard it was more of a draw.

441
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,970
这位是伊莱亚斯·阿马多  他也来听听
This is Elias Amador. He'll be joining us.

442
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:06,770
你好
Hello.

443
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,350
说实话  我还没来得及看计划书
Full disclosure, I haven't had time to read this,

444
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,790
但我欣赏穆特尼的发展
but love how you've grown Mutiny

445
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,170
非常期待你们的推介
and can't wait to hear what you've got.

446
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,220
这真是美好的意外之喜
I can't tell you what a nice change this is,

447
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,890
能见到熟人  还有伊莱亚斯
pitching to a familiar face and Elias.

448
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,220
-我们可以...  -准备好就可以开始了
- Shall we just...? - Whenever you're ready.

449
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,130
请想象一个地方
Imagine a place you could go

450
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,220
你所有热爱  收集和为之疯狂的东西
where whatever your passion, whatever you collect or love,

451
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,720
只需一键就能找到
it's available to you at the push of a button.

452
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,150
稀有的《蜘蛛侠》漫画  盗版的狄伦演唱会
A rare spider-man comic, a bootleg Dylan concert,

453
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,960
菲茨杰拉德初版小说
First edition Fitzgerald,

454
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,020
甚至是难找的苹果二号零件
even a hard-to-find part for your Apple II.

455
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,850
应有尽有  无需走遍当地跳蚤市场
It's all there. You don't have to scour the local flea market.

456
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,550
期望那里可能有你所需
On the chance that they might have it.

457
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,420
或是转遍车库甩卖
Or hit every garage sale.

458
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,010
期望那里可能有你所需
On the chance that they might have it.

459
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,870
你甚至不用出门
Or even leave your home.

460
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,430
因为你与全国人民连接在了一起
Because you're connecting to people across the country

461
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,510
-他们都是...  -请容我打断你们一下
- who are all part of... - Let me stop you right there.

462
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,100
你们说的这一切听起来很棒
Everything you're saying sounds terrific,

463
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,590
但我就直说了
but just to cut to the chase,

464
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,850
你们是准备将核心业务从聊天转变成交易吗
you're shifting your core business from chat to trade, yes?

465
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,640
不是转变  是扩张
No, not shifting. We're expanding.

466
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,770
这不是第一次了  我们以游戏起家
And it isn't the first time. We started with games.

467
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,760
然后发现玩家会在游戏中聊天
We noticed that our users were chatting during games,

468
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,420
于是我们开始做聊天室  我们的用户群指数增长
so we moved into chat and our base jumped exponentially.

469
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:25,560
然后我们发现我们的用户在聊天期间做交易
And then we noticed that our users were trading during chat,

470
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,150
我们是依据用户行为开拓市场的
so we go where the user behavior takes us.

471
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:32,440
这是我们经营模式  事实证明是非常高效的
It's our business model and it's proven to be highly effective.

472
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,550
嗯  我要问清楚
Right, just to be clear, though,

473
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,230
你们的扩张是基于
your expansion is predicated

474
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,720
在论坛上交换物品的点子
on the idea of swapping goods through a BBS?

475
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,620
-是的  -没错
- Yes. - Yes, exactly.

476
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,080
伊莱亚斯  想问什么吗
Elias, anything you'd like to ask?

477
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,350
不用  谢谢
I'm good. Thank you.

478
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,990
好了  多谢你们前来
Okay, thank you for coming in.

479
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,630
很荣幸  我们很期待...
Our pleasure. We'll look forward to...

480
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,160
恐怕我们得拒绝了
But I'm afraid it's a pass.

481
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,660
抱歉...我不懂
I'm sor... I don't understand.

482
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,310
你们不至少看看我们的数据吗
Don't you want to at least look at the numbers?

483
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,360
不了  抱歉
No, sorry.

484
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,130
好吧  多谢你们抽时间
Okay, well, thank you for your time.

485
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,860
谢谢
Thank you.

486
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,390
-谢谢你们前来  -嗯
- Thank you for coming in. - Yeah.

487
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,920
难以置信
Unbelievable.

488
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,280
还女性自强呢
So much for sisters doing it for themselves.

489
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,000
天呐  人说仅次于同意的就是干净利落的拒绝了
Jesus, they say the next best thing to a yes is a quick no.

490
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,250
这也太利落了
You can't get much quicker than that.

491
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,310
是啊  回绝得也太快了
Yeah, well, that was too goddamn quick.

492
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,190
就好像她看到是我时就已经决定了
It's like she made up her mind when she saw it was me.

493
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,500
不  不是的
No, she didn't.

494
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,940
克拉克先生  是你编写了黑掉了
Mr. Clark, you created the Sonaris virus

495
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,010
西方网络的索纳里斯病毒  是吗
that took down WestNet, yes?

496
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,610
不  我写了一个测绘网络大小的获取程序
No, I created a fetch program to detect network size.

497
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,390
但由于编码失误  它开始自我扩散
Due to an error, it self-propagated.

498
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,670
我跟病毒感染西方网络完全无关
I had nothing to do with it infecting WestNet.

499
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,700
但你的争议点在于麦克米伦杀毒软件
But it's your contention that the MacMillan antivirus software

500
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,810
是这个获取程序的变体
is a variation of this fetch program?

501
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,710
不  不是变体
No, no, it's not a variation.

502
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,820
452千行代码里只改了两千行
Only two kilo lines of code out of 452 were changed.

503
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,940
我之所以知道  因为那是我改的
I know this because I changed them myself

504
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,410
然后亲手拿去给了乔
and hand-delivered it to Joe.

505
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,950
是啊  他之后可能加了点花里胡哨的东西
Yes, he may have added some bells and whistles since then,

506
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,720
但是  他别想糊弄谁
but, come on, he's not fooling anyone.

507
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,690
你说你亲手拿去给了他
When you say you hand-delivered the program,

508
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,060
那是作为礼物  还是交易
was that a gift or a transaction?

509
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,550
礼物不也是一种交易吗
Aren't gifts a type of transaction?

510
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,390
礼物是给朋友的
You give a gift to a friend.

511
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,870
交易是跟生意伙伴完成的
You have a transaction with a business partner.

512
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:35,170
这是你现编的吗  还是真有这么个说法
Okay, did you just make that up or is that a real thing?

513
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,630
克拉克先生  你1985年7月30日
Mr. Clark, at what address did you live

514
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,610
当时的住址是哪里
on the date of July 30, 1985?

515
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:47,510
跟我1985年2月17日
Same address that I lived at on February 17, 1985,

516
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,530
1985年1月27日和1985年5月1日
and January 27, 1985, and May 1, 1985,

517
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,990
和其他你问到的日期的住址是一样的
and every other date that you've asked me about.

518
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,930
能请你重复下那个地址吗
Could you please repeat the address?

519
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,700
德克萨斯州  理查德森  蒂普街2824号
2824 Depue Drive, Richardson, Texas.

520
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,840
麦克米伦先生是否
And did Mr. MacMillan visit you

521
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,100
曾于1985年7月30日去过
at your residence at 2824 Depue Drive

522
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,340
你蒂普街2824号的房子
on July 30, 1985?

523
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,240
是的
Yes.

524
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,160
他怎么知道你住在那里的
And how did he know that you lived at said address?

525
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,180
因为他去过
Because he had been there before.

526
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,250
他为什么会去过
And why had he been there before?

527
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,670
因为我们曾是合作伙伴
Because we were business partners.

528
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,240
还是朋友
And friends?

529
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,680
是啊  朋友
Yeah, and friends.

530
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:34,050
他1985年7月30日
So, when he visited you on July 30, 1985,

531
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,750
去蒂普街2824号拜访你时
at 2824 Depue Drive,

532
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:40,820
是作为生意伙伴  还是朋友
was that as a business partner or a friend?

533
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,950
我不知道
I don't know.

534
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,460
你得去问他
You'd have to ask him.

535
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,420
你看呢
From your perspective.

536
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,250
我看
From my perspective?

537
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,750
我看  乔·麦克米伦做事只有一个原因
From my perspective, Joe MacMillan does things for one reason

538
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,860
没有其他
and one reason only and th...

539
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,180
拜托  我们在...
Hey, excuse me, we are right...

540
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,200
我们说好的
We had an agreement

541
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,870
取证要分别私下进行  麦克米伦先生
to keep these depositions private, Mr. MacMillan.

542
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,610
请继续说完
Please, finish that thought.

543
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,010
因为他是个自私  自厌
Because he's a selfish, self-loathing,

544
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,870
自利的混蛋
self-serving piece of shit.

545
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,830
我愿给你50%我在公司的股份
I'm prepared to offer you 50% of my stake in the company.

546
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,320
麦克米伦先生  这...
Mr. MacMillan, this is completely...

547
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,100
均分  但有一个条件
It's an even split. I've got one condition.

548
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,790
我要你来跟我一起经营
I want you to come run it with me.

549
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,900
麦克米伦先生  这种事
Mr. MacMillan, I'd really

550
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,760
你最好提前跟我...
prefer that you run something like this...

551
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,760
亚伦  没事的
Aaron, it's fine.

552
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,330
60%
60%.

553
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,430
70%
70%.

554
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,130
来做我的合伙人
Come be my partner

555
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,770
你就能拥有70%的公司股份
and 70% of the company is yours.

556
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,940
克拉克先生  以我专业之见
Mr. Clark, my professional advice

557
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,520
最好认真考虑...
would be to seriously consider...

558
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,470
我想声明
I'd like to state for the

559
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,000
这并非正式提议
record that this is not a legitimate offer.

560
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,080
非常正式  你给我什么我都签
It's fully legitimate. I'll sign anything you put in front of me.

561
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,770
只要你一句话  戈登
Just say the word, Gordon.

562
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,930
我不想跟你合作  乔
I don't want to work with you, Joe.

563
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,120
现在我们知道这宗诉讼究竟是为了什么了
I think we now know what this lawsuit is really about.

564
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:42,270
回到1985年7月30日
Returning to the date of July 30, 1985,

565
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,580
克拉克先生  依你看
Mr. Clark, from your perspective,

566
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,400
乔·麦克米伦前往你位于
did Joe MacMillan come to your residence

567
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,940
蒂普街2824号的房子时
at 2824 Depue Drive

568
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:56,370
是作为生意伙伴  还是朋友
as a business partner or a friend?

569
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,500
我不知道
I have no idea.

570
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,720
我们究竟要找什么
What are we looking for anyway?

571
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,520
错误
A mistake.

572
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,540
我父母在卧室里
My parents are up in their bedroom

573
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,410
为我的生日派对包礼物
wrapping presents for my birthday party.

574
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,590
好像我不知道他们在做什么似的
Like I don't know exactly what they're doing.

575
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,450
他们还当我是小孩
They still think of me as little.

576
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,540
那是因为他们没像我那样
Well, it's 'cause they've never seen you

577
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,720
见过你喝威士忌  抽雪茄
throw back a whiskey and smoke a cigar like I have.

578
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,230
我才没那么做呢
I never did that!

579
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,790
你在开玩笑
You're joking.

580
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,350
真希望我不用开生日派对
I wish I didn't have to have a birthday party.

581
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,340
我觉得生日派对没意思
I don't believe in birthday parties.

582
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,510
这也行吗
You can do that?

583
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,680
当然  你的生日  你想做什么都行
Yeah, it's your birthday. You can do whatever you want.

584
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,510
你找到错误了吗
Did you find the mistake?

585
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,670
没有
No.

586
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,740
你父母逼你开的
So who's coming to this stupid party

587
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:01,970
你又不想开的破派对
your parents are making you throw

588
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,530
都会有谁来
that you don't really want to have anyway?

589
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,680
我们出去吧  好吗
Okay, let's take it outside, okay?

590
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,500
好了  各位
All right, everybody,

591
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,780
我们去后院吧
let's move it on out to the backyard.

592
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,730
出去吧  我们走
Slip'n slide is out there. Let's go, let's go.

593
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,080
都出去  快走
Everybody out. Move it.

594
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,800
快走  出去
Get out of here. Go. Go.

595
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,920
琼妮  又有客人来了
Joanie, you've got another guest to greet.

596
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,700
琼妮
Joanie!

597
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,550
谢天谢地
Oh, thank goodness.

598
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,790
请进
Come on in.

599
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,350
詹妮弗知道是哪条街
Jennifer knew the name of the street,

600
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,600
但不知道具体地址
but not the address.

601
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,120
所以我们停好车  祈祷  然后循着尖叫声来了
So we parked, prayed, and followed the screams.

602
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,960
没想到你会来
I wasn't expecting you.

603
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,370
琼妮请了詹妮弗
Joanie invited Jennifer

604
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,090
我又是她的司机
and seeing as how I am her chauffeur,

605
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:49,000
所以就一起来了  这个该放哪
we're part of a package deal. Where should I put this?

606
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,780
其他姑娘和礼物桌都在后面
You know what? The girls and the gift table are all out back.

607
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,890
她居然来了
I cannot believe she's here.

608
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:01,150
看来琼妮和詹妮弗和好了
I guess Joanie patched things up with Jennifer.

609
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:05,180
天呐  这年纪的女孩  真是疯了
God, I'm telling you, girls at this age, it's crazy.

610
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,240
前一天还是死敌
One day they're mortal enemies,

611
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,040
第二天就成闺蜜了
the next day they're best friends.

612
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,260
怎么了
What?

613
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,690
她都来了
Well, I mean, she's here.

614
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:17,350
我们不该利用一下吗
Should we take advantage of it?

615
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,510
不  我才不想再被羞辱
No, I don't want to face that humiliation again.

616
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,220
爸爸  看我啊
Daddy, daddy! Watch me!

617
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,100
莱恩  你来了
Hey, Ryan, you made it.

618
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,690
是啊  我不能待太久
Yeah. I can't stay long.

619
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,260
-当然  派对很棒的  -谢谢
- Not that it's not a nice party. - Thanks.

620
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:41,990
不过我也不了解
I wouldn't know;

621
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,240
我没参加过10岁女孩的生日派对
I've never been to a 10-year-old's birthday party.

622
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,990
10岁之后就没有过了
Well, not since I was 10.

623
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,250
大人在这种场合里该做什么
What do grown-ups do at these things?

624
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,010
喝酒
Oh, well, drink.

625
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,140
那个
Hey, so...

626
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,540
听着  我们今天不该谈工作上的事
So listen, we're not supposed to be talking shop today,

627
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,510
但我知道该怎么推进你关于聊天室的点子
but I had a few ideas on how to move your chat idea forward.

628
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,670
是吗  怎么做
Oh, yeah? Really? How?

629
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:07,190
嗯  听着
Yeah, well, all right, listen.

630
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,020
几年前  计算机服务的民用电台模拟器
A few years back, CompuServe had this CB simulator

631
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,680
让我超级着迷
that I was totally obsessed with.

632
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,090
我们可以把那个作为基本模板
We could start with that as a rudimentary template.

633
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:16,060
我的点子比计算机服务先进多了
My idea is way more advanced than CompuServe.

634
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:19,100
我知道  我们只需要他们的
I know, I know. All we would take from CompuServe is...

635
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,920
模拟器的共享内存虚拟阵列管理器代码
is the shared memory virtual array manager from the CBsim code.

636
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,730
我们可以扩展它  以支持更多用户
We make it bigger so we can support more users

637
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,750
其他的我们就从零建起
and the rest we build from scratch.

638
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,080
这是能节省时间
That would be a time-saver.

639
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,470
是啊
Yeah, totally.

640
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,080
过来
Come here.

641
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,370
没人是在真空中做设计
No one designs in a vacuum.

642
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,490
如果你真正的创新点在于轮胎
What's the point in reinventing the wheel

643
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,930
何必重新发明轮子呢
if your true innovation is creating the tire?

644
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:45,690
是啊
Yeah.

645
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,850
比如巨人电脑
Take the Giant, okay?

646
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:51,160
随你怎么损它  但我是从IBM个人电脑做起
Say what you will about it, but I started with a IBM PC

647
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,920
最终产品比它快一倍  便宜一半
and made something that was twice as fast at half the cost

648
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,850
而且仅重15磅  十分便携
and portable at 15 pounds.

649
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,670
那不是乔·麦克米伦做的吗
I thought that was Joe MacMillan.

650
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,720
乔·麦克米伦或许空想出了一堆参数
Joe MacMillan might have pulled the specs out of his ass,

651
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,550
但把空想变成现实
but turning them into a working product?

652
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,890
那可不是他的长项
No, not really his bag of tricks.

653
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,140
你好啊  莱恩  看
Howdy, Ryan. Look at this.

654
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,090
-什么啊  -给琼妮买的
- What you got there? - Got it for Joanie.

655
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,860
-机器人管家  -太可笑了
- Robo butler. - That looks ridiculous.

656
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,840
反正又不是你过生日  是吧
Yeah, well, it ain't your birthday, is it?

657
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,100
-究竟做什么的  -来  看看
- What's it do exactly? - Here, look at this.

658
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,310
看啊
Lookit here.

659
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,800
过来  我展示给你看
Come here, let me show you. Come on.

660
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,650
好了  来
Look, all right, here.

661
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,760
把你的啤酒放进它的小金属爪子里
Get your beers right there into the metal paws. Come on.

662
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,530
如果还得把酒放进它手里
If you got to put the beers in his hands,

663
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:38,860
何不直接自己拿着好了
why don't you just take them with you?

664
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,870
让机器人拿给你有什么意义啊
I mean, what's the point of having the robot bring them to you?

665
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,430
因为他是管家  这是他的工作
'cause he's a butler, man. It's what he does.

666
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,460
-好吧  -退后  看着
- All right. - Now back up. Back up. Watch.

667
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,810
琼妮肯定会喜欢的
Joanie gonna love this.

668
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,520
看啊  去吧  管家
Look at him. Come on there, butler.

669
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,350
瞧我啊  我是个机器人管家
Look at me, I'm robo butler.

670
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,940
先生们想再来点酒吗
Would you gentlemen care for more beers?

671
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,560
博斯  它好慢啊
Bos, it's so slow.

672
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,380
它走得那么慢
I mean, look, it's taking forever to get here.

673
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,180
我自己过去都快点
I could've walked over here faster.

674
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,360
我还有收据
I got the receipt.

675
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,520
别把这个给琼妮
Don't give that to Joanie,

676
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,770
她只会不开心的
All right. You're only gonna upset her.

677
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,990
她会喜欢的
She gonna love it.

678
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,960
很高兴琼妮和詹妮弗的关系好起来了
Hey, nice to see Joanie and Jennifer getting along.

679
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,970
我要告诉你  我一周能听60个推介
Just so you know, I get 60 proposals a week.

680
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,800
大部分时候  我会全部拒绝
Most weeks I pass on all 60.

681
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,430
并不是针对你
It really had nothing to do with you.

682
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,050
我完全理解
No, I completely understand.

683
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:45,080
只是你拒绝得好快
It was a really quick no you gave us in there, though.

684
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:50,660
好吧  我们谈吧  但去别的地方
All right, let's talk, but not out here.

685
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,050
你们在笑我的管家吗  孩子
Are you laughing at my butler, children?

686
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,990
走开  都走开
Get out of here. Scram, all of you.

687
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,110
快走  该死的管家
Get out of here. Dang butler.

688
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,210
真是的  老天爷啊
Oh, hell. Oh, for christ's sake.

689
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,650
我一直在梳理我们的计划书
I've been combing over our prospectus,

690
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,610
回想我们的会面
replaying our meeting,

691
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:05,080
想搞明白伊莱亚斯的纸条为什么搞砸了一切
trying to figure out why Elias's note derailed things.

692
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,330
我已经锁定在三种可能性之间了
I've narrowed it down to three possibilities.

693
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,970
一  伊莱亚斯不认为我们的用户群
A, Elias doesn't believe our user base

694
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,650
能像我们预期的那样接受穆特尼易物
will embrace Mutiny Exchange as rapidly as our projections,

695
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,170
这是错的
which is wrong.

696
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,870
二  伊莱亚斯认为我们对开发到测试的时间表
B, Elias thinks our timeframe from development to beta

697
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:21,020
过于乐观了  这也是错的
is overly optimistic, which is also wrong.

698
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,760
三  伊莱亚斯是个性别歧视的混蛋
C, Elias is a sexist jerk

699
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,790
他不认为两个女人能经营好公司
who doesn't believe two women can run a company, which...

700
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,990
-好了  -我比较倾向于第三种
- Okay. - I'm leaning towards c.

701
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,020
伊莱亚斯的确是个性别歧视的混蛋
Elias is a sexist jerk,

702
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,050
但比大部分人强
but better than most.

703
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,770
他才不在乎谁经营一家公司
He doesn't care who runs a company

704
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,350
只要能挣钱就行
as long as it makes him money.

705
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:38,150
好吧  那我不明白了  因为你是个聪明人
Okay, then I'm at a loss because you're a smart woman

706
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,100
易物是个好主意
and Exchange is a great idea.

707
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,360
我是聪明  这点子也的确很棒
I am smart and it is a great idea.

708
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,850
这就是你们的问题所在  你们没想到第四点
And that's your problem. You didn't allow for D.

709
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,740
已经有别家公司在做这个了
Another company is already doing this.

710
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,130
什么  谁
What? Who?

711
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,150
一家小公司
It's a small outfit

712
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,960
伊莱亚斯在考察他们的投资可能
Elias has been tracking as a potential investment.

713
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,530
跳蚤市场
Swapmeet.

714
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:57,810
好名字
It's a good name.

715
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:58,350
我之前不知道
I wasn't aware of it.

716
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,550
否则就不会让你们来了
Otherwise I never would have had you come in.

717
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,970
你对他们有什么了解
What do you know about them?

718
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,610
只知道他们已经做了18个月了
Only that they have an 18-month head start.

719
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,230
而且说到底
And at the end of the day,

720
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,200
这是我们决定的依据
that's what informed our decision.

721
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,350
我们没道理下注在穆特尼身上
It made no sense to bet on Mutiny

722
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,920
这场仗你们不仅是要输
in a battle you weren't just losing,

723
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,140
甚至不知道自己在打
but didn't even know you were fighting.

724
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,240
等等  伙计们  想来玩吗
Hey, wait, guys, do you want to come play?

725
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,370
我们玩个游戏吧
Okay, let's play a game.

726
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:26,080
亲爱的  你还好吗
Hey, sweetie. You doing okay?

727
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:32,890
她把注意力都吸引走了  是吧
Oh, she's really pulling focus, isn't she?

728
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,220
就好像是她的生日派对  而不是你的
Kind of like it's her birthday party and not yours.

729
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,030
亲爱的  我只想告诉你
Look, honey, I just want you to know

730
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,600
我是多么为你骄傲
how proud I am of you

731
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,390
因为你邀请了詹妮弗
For inviting Jennifer.

732
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,060
这很成熟
It shows real maturity.

733
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,760
-好吧  -生日不仅仅是一场派对
- Okay. - A birthday's not just a party.

734
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,680
而是标志了你人生的历程
It's marking a passage of time in your life.

735
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,860
你让我看到  你不再是个小女孩了
You're showing me you're not just a little girl anymore...

736
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,770
我知道啦  我长大了  你为我自豪
Okay, I heard you. Growing up and you're proud of me.

737
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,020
我们能切蛋糕了吗
Can we just do the cake now?

738
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,640
不  过来
No, no. Come here.

739
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,960
我希望你真的明白我的话
I want to make sure you hear what I'm saying.

740
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,740
你今天的做法很成熟
Okay, you did a really grown-up thing today

741
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,690
爸爸
and your dad,

742
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,110
此时此刻非常为你骄傲
he couldn't be more proud of you than he is right now.

743
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,470
别再那么说了
Stop saying that.

744
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,640
卡梅伦付了我20美元让我请詹妮弗来的
Cameron paid me 20 bucks to invite Jennifer to come.

745
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,680
好吗
Okay?

746
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,960
我讨厌詹妮弗
I hate Jennifer.

747
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,030
我们能切蛋糕了吗
Can we just do the cake now, please?

748
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,300
-大家都在问  -好
- Everyone's asking for it. - Yeah, sure.

749
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,910
我们去切蛋糕吧
Let's do the cake.

750
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,720
我在穆特尼上到处打听了
Okay, I've been on Mutiny asking around,

751
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,250
想问问关于这个跳蚤市场的信息
trying to figure out what I could about this Swapmeet.

752
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,930
-怎么样  -就我看来
- And? - From what I can tell,

753
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,240
它的构想
it sounds seriously less robust

754
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,790
远不如我们对易物的构想宏大
than what we have in mind for Exchange.

755
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:44,320
而且  它主攻体育纪念品
Plus, it's focused on sports memorabilia,

756
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,630
我觉得它根本赶不上
so I just can't see it reaching anywhere

757
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,590
我们的用户群大
near the size and scope of our user base.

758
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,080
詹妮弗居然
Hey, sure was weird

759
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,540
会来参加派对  真是奇怪  是吧
that Jennifer came to the party, wasn't it?

760
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,220
是啊  我们不能输给不如我们的东西
Yeah. We will not lose to an inferior product.

761
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,840
我不要被这种东西比下去
I refuse to be Betamax.

762
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,830
我好像没请她来
'cause I don't remember inviting her.

763
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:00,930
不是我们  是琼妮自己决定的
Oh, no, we didn't. Joanie did that all on her own.

764
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,180
多成熟啊
Wasn't that mature of her?

765
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,400
是啊
Yeah, it was.

766
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,280
她能邀请詹妮弗
It shows a hell of a lot of maturity

767
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,870
真是太成熟了
that she would invite Jennifer.

768
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,850
倒是提醒我了
Which, you know, reminds me.

769
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,430
干什么  这是干吗的
What? What is this for?

770
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,290
感谢你今天的帮忙
For all your help today.

771
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:20,820
好吧
Okay.

772
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:22,620
谢谢
Thanks.

773
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,390
我回屋了
I'll be in my room.

774
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,670
她去替派对买杯子来着
She went out and grabbed some cups for us at the party.

775
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,410
莱恩·雷
Ryan Ray.

776
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,810
莱恩
Ryan.

777
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,440
麦克米伦先生
Mr. MacMillan.

778
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,380
莱恩  帮我个忙
Ryan, I want you to do something for me.

779
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,780
好的
Okay.

780
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,300
干什么
What?

781
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,460
我要你站起来
I want you to stand up.

782
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,130
我要你好好看看周围
I want you to take a long look around.

783
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,310
你一定要把
I want you to make sure you see

784
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,560
房间里的每个人都收进眼底
every single person in that room.

785
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,490
-你在做了吗  -是的
- Are you doing that? - Yeah.

786
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,060
很好
Good.

787
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,850
忘记他们吧
Now forget them,

788
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:25,030
他们不再是你的同事了
because you don't work with those people anymore.

789
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,950
明早9点整  我办公室见
I'll see you tomorrow at my office, 9:00 a.m. sharp.

790
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,010
天呐
Oh, my god.

791
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,700
我会到的
I'll be there.

792
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,050
谢谢
Thank you.

793
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,010
莱恩  还有件事
Now, Ryan, there's one more thing

794
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,380
我需要你做
I want you to do for me.

795
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:49,020
-难以置信  -看
- Incredible. - Look.

796
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,130
她来了  转过来
It's her. Turn around.

797
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,180
有点正式了吧
Isn't this a bit formal for us?

798
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:55,750
我们可以
We could just meet

799
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,490
下个月在詹妮弗的生日派对上见
at Jennifer's birthday party next month.

800
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,400
不  我们就好
Oh, no, we'll just be a minute.

801
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,550
我真的很欣赏坚持
I admire persistence, I really do,

802
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,890
但我们都说过了
but we've been over this.

803
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,490
就算我想
Even if I wanted to,

804
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,610
我也不能说服我的合伙人资助你们扩张
I couldn't convince my partners to fund your expansion.

805
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,440
-对不起  -不  我们理解
- I'm sorry. - No, we understand.

806
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,420
-我们不是为此而来  -你是对的
- That's not why we're here. - No, because you're right.

807
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,580
跳蚤市场是我们的竞争对手
Swapmeet is our competition.

808
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,570
你们投资一百多万  看我们追进度
It'd be foolish for you to invest over a million dollars

809
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,090
太傻了
just to see if we can catch up.

810
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,750
所以我们做足了功课
And that's why we've done our homework.

811
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:18,990
我们发现
And what we found is that

812
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:21,580
跳蚤市场虽然有可行的程序
while swapmeet does have a functional program

813
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,900
而这我们需要追赶一年甚至更久
that it would take us a year or more to compete with,

814
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,260
但他们比不上的
what they don't have

815
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,930
是我们广大的用户群
is anywhere near the size of our user base.

816
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,400
我们不要求你帮我们跟跳蚤市场竞争

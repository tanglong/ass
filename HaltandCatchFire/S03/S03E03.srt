CQ  有人吗
CQ, is anybody out there?

42
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,500
有人吗  我是KC4L
Hello? This is KC4L.

43
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,860
有人听得到吗
Can anybody hear me?

44
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,470
那是什么
What's that?

45
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,770
我自己搭的无线电
It's a radio that I made.

46
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,890
CQ是什么意思
What does CQ mean?

47
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,220
如果你要找其他搭了无线电的人
It's what you say when you're looking for other people

48
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,670
就要说CQ
who've made radios.

49
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,040
从法语词sécurité来的
Comes from the French word sécurité,

50
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,790
意思是安全  保障
which means safety or security.

51
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,780
听着和sécu差不多
You can hear it when you say "Sécu, sécu."

52
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,570
有什么事吗
Did you want something?

53
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,350
我想道晚安
I wanted to say good night.

54
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,590
天啊  小家伙  对不起
Oh, God, Lump, I'm so sorry.

55
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,880
刷牙了吗
Did you brush your teeth?

56
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,820
我马上就过来  好吧
Okay, I'll be out there in just a second, okay?

好吧
Okay.

59
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,820
你把那玩意从德州带来
That thing made it from Texas

60
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,950
却把厨宝产品留在了仓库里吗
and the KitchenAid is still in storage?

61
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,480
你真打算站那儿
Are you really gonna stand there 

62
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,900
装成是会用那台搅拌机的人吗
and try and pass yourself off as someone who ever used that mixer?

63
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,030
你觉得这地方适合搞这些吗
Are you sure this is the best place for all this?

64
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,070
我相当确定这里极不适合
No, I'm pretty sure it's the worst place for it,

65
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,870
但既然我本来想用的地方被占了
but since the place that I was gonna use isn't available,

66
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,850
-就这么凑合吧  -好吧  抱歉
- I'm making do. - Okay, sorry.

67
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,370
找到人了吗
Have you found anyone?

68
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,190
没有  连接不好
No, the connection sucks.

69
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,250
或许是天线的问题
Is it the antenna, maybe?

70
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,180
我也说不准  有可能
I don't know. Could be.

71
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,770
也可能是我小时候
Or it could be that all the guys

72
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,140
那些用这个的人
that were out there when I was a kid

73
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,710
都忙着经营公司没时间玩无线电了
are too busy running companies to have time for hams.

74
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,700
嗯  或者他们改上网了
Yeah, or they moved online.

75
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,720
肯定还有新的发烧友
There must be some new kids out there.

76
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,630
我一会儿就出来
I'll be out in a sec.

77
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,030
CQ  CQ  我的天  有人吗
CQ, CQ, for shit's sake, is anybody out there?

78
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,790
卡梅伦和我决定开个每周项目会议
Hey, Cameron and I decided to have a weekly project meeting

79
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,080
梳理跳蚤市场的整合
to streamline the SwapMeet integration

80
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,360
我们认为你的参与会很有价值
and we thought that you'd be a valuable addition.

81
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,220
好的  没问题
Yeah, sure.

82
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,740
如果你希望我参与的话
If you want me there.

83
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,920
嗯  我们希望
Yeah, we do.

84
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,580
你希望我参加
Do you want me there 

85
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,920
是因为你觉得我可能会有贡献
because you think I might have something to contribute

86
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,330
还是因为你想让我感觉自己有事做
or because you want me to feel like I have something to do?

87
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,160
只是因为我尊重你的观点呢
How about just because I respect your opinion?

88
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,680
因为我不想让你觉得我不能自己振作
'Cause I just don't want you to feel like I can't self-start

89
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,100
因为我完全可以的
because I absolutely can.

90
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,530
你当然可以  但程序员都依赖你
No, of course you can, but the coders look to you.

91
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,580
我觉得你会是条很有价值的纽带
I feel like you could be a valuable liaison.

92
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,330
并且我希望有你在
And I want you there.

93
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,450
好的  我会去的
Okay. Yeah. I'll be there.

94
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,970
很好
Good.

95
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,190
我其实没什么选择
You know I don't really have a choice.

96
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,990
你是我的依靠
You're my ride.

97
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,570
-麦克米伦先生  -莱恩  欢迎
- Mr. MacMillan. Hi. - Ryan, welcome.

98
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,240
我没想到这...
I didn't realize it was, you know,

99
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,360
会是个这么大派对  所以...
gonna be such a big party, so I...

100
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,500
太有心了  谢谢
That was very thoughtful. Thank you.

101
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,160
你家真漂亮
This is really a beautiful place you have.

102
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,840
光线很暗
You know, it's dark.

103
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,190
不太能看清楚东西
Can't really see what everything looks like,

104
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,150
但就我看来  这...
but from what I can tell, it's--

105
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,910
这很...
it's so...

106
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,270
亚洲风
Asian.

107
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,210
我很高兴你喜欢
I'm glad you like it.

108
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,530
嗯  我找了好久才找到
Yeah, it took me a while to find it.

109
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,220
这城市我不太熟
I don't really know the city that well.

110
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,270
我在伯林盖姆长大
I grew up in Burlingame.

111
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,100
那里不远
It's not far.

112
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,500
只是  我们不经常来城里
Just-- yeah, we didn't really get to come to the city that much.

113
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,860
但我真的很喜欢  看看这儿
I really do like it, though. I mean, look at it.

114
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,710
它真是
It's just so...

115
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,360
很亚洲风
Asian.

116
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,200
你朋友真多
You sure do have a lot of friends, huh?

117
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,180
我不会把这些人叫做朋友
I wouldn't really call these people my friends.

118
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,710
他们大多都不知道自己在谁的房子里
Most of them don't even know whose house they're at.

119
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,440
除了那边的肯
Except for Ken over there.

120
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,810
肯很清楚状况
Ken knows exactly where he is.

121
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,030
我渴了
You know what? I'm thirsty.

122
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,340
我们打开它吧
Why don't we open this up?

123
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,990
那你现在住在哪
So whereabouts do you live now?

124
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,920
还在伯林盖姆吗
Or are you still in Burlingame?

125
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,570
不  我搬出来有段时间了
Oh, no, I got out of there a while ago.

126
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,750
我现在在洛斯阿图斯和大学同学住一起
I'm in Los Altos now with a bunch of college buddies.

127
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,610
他们对我给你打工都很眼红
They're really jealous that I'm working for you.

128
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,560
我告诉他们办公室在顶层...
I was telling them about how the office is on the top--

129
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,760
你有什么爱好
What do you do for fun?

130
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,560
就是平常那些东西
Oh, um, you know, the usual.

131
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,340
打游戏  看电影
Video games. Movies.

132
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,590
但还是最喜欢编程
But mostly I just love to code.

133
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,360
你不知道我多好奇
I can't tell you how curious I am

134
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,100
你想让我做什么
to see what you have in mind for me.

135
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,920
是你来找我  莱恩
You came to me, Ryan.

136
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,240
我知道
Yeah, I know.

137
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,670
我有一堆想法  我很想向你展示
I have a ton of ideas. I'd love to show them to you.

138
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,390
但我知道公司正全力开发2.0版
But I know the company is focused on user version 2.0 right now.

139
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,220
所以我准备好加入了
So I'm just ready to pitch in.

140
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,760
你觉得这就是我要的吗
Is that what you think I'm looking for?

141
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,960
好吧  有个我需要去打招呼的人来了
All right, someone just came in who I really need to speak to.

142
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,710
这是个派对  好好享受
Hey, it's a party. Try and have fun.

143
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,770
你怎么起了
What are you doing up?

144
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,300
乔·麦克米伦
Joe MacMillan?

145
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,170
不是吧
Really?

146
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,610
你知道你卷进什么样的情况里了吗
Do you have any idea what you're getting yourself into?

147
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,210
我是想学点东西...
Well, I was hoping to learn something--

148
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,690
我知道你现在肯定觉得自己很特别
Look, I know you must be feeling real special right about now.

149
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,920
乔很擅长这点  但相信我
Joe's great at that, but trust me,

150
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,880
他会害了你
he will burn you.

151
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,100
我知道我该早点告诉你此事
Look, I know I should have probably talked to you about it--

152
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,340
他是这么对我  戈登也是
He did it to me. He did it to Gordon.

153
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,030
甚至唐娜  全世界最好的女人
Even Donna, the nicest woman on the planet,

154
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,190
也不再跟他说话了
esn't speak to him anymore.

155
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,810
你觉得你会有什么不同吗
You think you're gonna be any different?

156
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,710
我不知道  卡梅伦
I don't know, Cameron.

157
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,260
我理解
Listen, I get it.

158
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,320
真的  我懂
Really, I do.

159
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,010
我愿意放过你一次
And I'm willing to give you a pass just this once.

160
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,180
回穆特尼
Come back to Mutiny.

161
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,210
干点切实的事
Be a part of something real.

162
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,850
我看其他人不会接受我回去的
I don't even think the guys would have me back.

163
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,240
如果我让他们接受  他们就得接受
Well, the guys will deal if I tell them to.

164
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,770
你的决定是
What do you say?

165
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,180
好吧
Okay.

166
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,670
你做了个非常愚蠢的决定
You just made a really dumb call.

167
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,090
我告诉她你不在家  她不肯走
I told her you weren't home. She wouldn't leave.

168
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,370
她等了差不多一个小时
She was here for like an hour

169
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,570
就干瞪眼
just staring.

170
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,410
老兄  你去哪了
Dude, where've you been?

171
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,450
我喝醉了  在乔家里昏睡过去了
I got hammered and passed out at Joe's.

172
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,110
好玩吗
Hey, was that fun?

173
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,970
我不清楚那算是什么
I don't know what the hell it was.

174
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,880
那明显没道理
Okay, that makes absolutely zero sense.

175
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,020
我们认为很有道理
Well, we thought it made a lot of sense.

176
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,700
你们是公司的头
Well, you guys are the heads of the company.

177
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,960
当然是该由你们
Of course you should be the ones

178
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,460
去把报价拿给跳蚤市场
to bring the offer over to SwapMeet.

179
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,310
戈登  这就是走个过场
Gordon, it's a formality.

180
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,140
博斯去就好了
Bos can do it.

181
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,540
这不是走过场  这事关别人的看法
It's not a formality. It's about perception.

182
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,510
你们要收购的人
And the people that you're buying,

183
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,240
特别是他们还要来这里工作
especially since they're coming to work here,

184
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,240
得把你和唐娜当做负责人
need to view you and Donna as the ones in charge.

185
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,360
戈登  我们已经见过他们无数次了
Gordon, we've already met with them a gazillion times, okay?

186
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,740
我们一起吃午餐  喝酒  他们知道我们是头儿
We've had lunch. We've had drinks. They know we're in charge.

187
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,990
要是照我的法子来  他们就把磁盘寄给我们
God, if I had it my way, they'd just send us the disks

188
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,370
一切就搞定了
and we could call it a day.

189
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,930
就是去送个信封
Okay, look, it's dropping off an envelope.

190
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,710
你不介意去做吧
You don't mind doing it, do you?

191
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,140
你还能更轻描淡写一点吗
Do you want to make it sound any less important?

192
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,850
-我很乐于这么做  -谢谢
- I would be happy to do it. - Thank you.

193
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,170
就因为她拉不下架子  整个公司
Okay, so the whole company is gonna bend over backwards

194
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,830
就要顺着她吗
because she can't get over herself.

195
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,550
不  我也觉得我们不该去
No, I don't think it's a good idea for us to go either.

196
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,570
公司领导不该亲自处理最初报价
The heads of the company don't tender the initial offer.

197
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,130
我们等回价  然后开始谈判后
We wait for the counter and only get involved

198
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,790
再进行干预
when the real negotiations begin.

199
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,890
这才能告诉他们  谁才是头儿
That's how you show them who's in charge.

200
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,920
好吧
Mm, okay.

201
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,490
好  下一项
Okay, up next,

202
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,820
背景图像处理的速度如何了
how are we doing on the speed of the background graphics?

203
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,670
以2400波特肯定无法控制在半秒之下
Well, we'll never get under half a second at 2,400 baud.

204
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,700
我们要用霍夫曼编码
We're gonna need to use Huffman,

205
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,690
或者用更好的LZ压缩算法
or even better, Lempel-Ziv compressions

206
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:33,800
这样就不用发送所有的字节
so we're not sending all the bits through.

207
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,530
我们怎么还要对信息理论
Okay, since when are we doing a graduate seminar

208
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,870
进行学术探讨了  我们的人做不到的
on information theory? Our guys can't handle that.

209
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,590
不  不发送所有的字节是个很聪明的办法
No, no, no. That's smart not sending all the bits through.

210
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,380
我们在用户已有的
We preload the most common backgrounds

211
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,810
磁盘上预载普通背景
on the diskettes users already have

212
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,510
然后只发出产品目录就行
and just send the catalog numbers.

213
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,430
好  只要把索引发到场景里
Okay, so just send the index to the scene.

214
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,260
那不错  我明白了
Okay, that's good. I see that.

215
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,470
这不错吧  不用复杂的编程
That's good, right? No complex coding.

216
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,450
这样的话图片数量有限
Well, you'll have a limited set of images

217
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,210
用户每次等来等去只会等来同样的图片
and the user will get tired of waiting for the same-old same-old,

218
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,930
但是如果你们想这样做  那也好
but, yeah, it's great if that's what you guys want to do. Great.

219
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,900
-很好  -好啊
- Great. - Great.

220
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,690
那我们就预载数据  谢谢
So we will preload the data. Thank you.

221
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,760
现在进入我原以为会是本次会议
And now for what I thought was going to be

222
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,830
唯一不愉快的议题
the only unpleasant topic for this meeting--

223
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,530
显然我错了
evidently I was wrong--

224
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,730
找人代替莱恩
replacing Ryan.

225
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,780
今早我去过他家了
Oh, I went by his house this morning.

226
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,420
他不愿意回来
He is not open to coming back.

227
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,670
怎么了
What?

228
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,770
你没伤害他吧
You didn't harm him in any way, did you?

229
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,890
没  我走时他还好好的
No, he was fine when I left.

230
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,060
他是个白痴  但他还能走
I mean, he's a moron, but he was ambulatory.

231
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,780
我希望你今晚能在那个班上物色下人选
You know, I want you looking for people at that class tonight.

232
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,440
天啊
Oh, God.

233
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,710
我要替你去吃午餐了
Hey, look, I'm already covering for you at this lunch.

234
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,990
你就别抱怨被下一代编码人才
And don't complain about being asked for by name

235
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,740
指名道姓地请去了
by the next generation of coding talent.

236
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,000
你该感到荣幸
You should be very flattered.

237
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,780
就算我找到了  也得好久才能赶上进度
Even if I find someone, it's gonna take forever to catch them up.

238
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,050
莱恩真的明白领域编码的精髓
Ryan really understood the guts of the neighborhood code.

239
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,260
如果要把跳蚤市场建在它边上
And if we're gonna build out SwapMeet alongside it,

240
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,300
我们就需要个真正懂行的人
we need someone who really gets it.

241
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,720
那是谁写的这部分的原始代码
Well, uh, who wrote the original code for that section?

242
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,660
-汤姆  -很好  汤姆是哪个
- Tom did. - Great, which one is Tom?

243
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,980
他不在这里了  他没和我们一起来
None of them. He didn't make the trip.

244
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,100
-为什么  -他就是没来
- Why not? - He just didn't.

245
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,980
-是因为钱的原因还是  -不是
- Okay, was it a money thing or... - No.

246
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,770
-那我们把他请回来  -不行
- Well, then get him back. - No.

247
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,200
如果不能把莱恩找回来 
If you can't get Ryan, 

248
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,620
去找写原始代码的程序员才最合理啊
getting the programmer who originated the code makes the most sense.

249
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,020
听着  戈登  我说了不行
Look, Gordon, I said no. 

250
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,480
我们能不说他了吗
Can we just drop it, please?

251
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,880
如果没人听我的意见
Why am I even in this meeting

252
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,190
为什么还要我参加这个会议
if no one's gonna listen to a word I have to say?

253
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,020
我们在听  只是我们意见不同
We are listening. We're simply disagreeing.

254
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,480
不  唐娜  是你的意见不同
No, Donna, you're disagreeing.

255
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,450
因为你在对一些
Because you are opining on subjects

256
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,630
你并不了解的事发表意见
about which you do not have all the information.

257
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,660
我的意见是针对我完全了解的事
I am opining on subjects on which I am fully informed.

258
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,690
不  戈登  你真的不了解
No, Gordon, you really aren't.

259
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,500
你去做别的事的时候发生了很多事
A lot happened while you were off doing other things.

260
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,670
该死的  唐娜
Oh, damn it, Donna.

261
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,000
我就上过她一次  天啊
You know what? I screwed her once, okay? Jesus.

262
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,430
我出去一下
Excuse me.

263
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,610
你是怎么回事
What the hell was that?

264
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,090
拜托  好像卡梅伦不知道一样
Please, like Cameron doesn't already know.

265
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,780
家里的墙壁那么薄
The walls in our place are so goddamn thin,

266
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,500
我去拉屎她都听得一清二楚
she can hear it every time I take a shit.

267
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,100
我请你来开会  你就是这个样子吗
I invite you to a meeting and this is the way you behave?

268
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,800
你怎么回事
What is wrong with you?

269
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,980
我受够了  不想再受罚了
I am sick and tired of being punished.

270
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,010
好吗  我同意搬家  我买了主机
Okay? I agreed to the move. I bought the mainframe.

271
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,730
我又修好了主机  我让她和我们一起住
I fixed the mainframe. I've let her live with us.

272
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,750
你提出的一切要求  我都照做了
Everything I've been asked to do, I've done.

273
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,090
我反驳你是因为汤姆是卡梅伦前男友
I shut you down because Tom is Cameron's ex-boyfriend.

274
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,120
那又怎样
So what?

275
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,760
这显然是个敏感话题
So it's obviously a sensitive subject

276
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,400
我是想让你不再谈论这个话题
and I was trying to steer you away from it.

277
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,760
所以你觉得我劈腿是个不错的话题
So you thought my infidelity would be a wonderful topic?

278
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,130
是你先提起的
You brought that up.

279
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,170
我去做别的事的时候
While I was off doing other things.

280
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,820
好像这屋里的人都不懂似的
Like everybody in this room doesn't know what that means.

281
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,730
-我指的是主机的事  -才不是呢
- I was talking about the mainframe. - No, you weren't.

282
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,060
你指的不是主机  别跟我装
No, you weren't and don't pretend that you were.

283
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,730
这事一直阴魂不散  唐娜
It's always there, Donna.

284
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,940
每次我看着你  你从没放过它
Every time I look at you, it's always there.

285
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,360
我们不该在这儿讨论这事
This is not something to discuss here.

286
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,960
回家再说
We'll talk about it at home.

287
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,040
有什么区别吗
What's the difference?

288
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,140
有人吗
Hello?

289
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,020
从以太向你问好
Greetings from the ether.

290
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,200
有人吗
Is anybody there?

291
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,330
我在  听得到吗
I'm right here. Can you hear me?

292
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,010
我在  这里是KC4L  完毕
I'm right here. This is KC4L, over.

293
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:45,830
你好
Hello?

294
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,980
我在  能听到吗
I'm right here. Can you hear me?

295
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,970
这边请
Right this way.

296
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,190
第一次在我们这儿就餐吗
First time dining with us?

297
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,310
不是  是倒好了
No. I wish.

298
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,460
-你好  -不用起来
- Oh, hello there. - No, don't get up.

299
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,760
抱歉
Sorry.

300
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,980
卡梅伦呢
Where's Cameron?

301
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,520
她在为今晚的客座演讲准备
Oh, she is preparing a guest lecture she is giving tonight.

302
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,530
她很遗憾不能抽身前来
She's so sorry that she couldn't make it.

303
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,510
我们只好自己吃了
We'll have to soldier on without her.

304
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,420
需要喝点什么吗
May I get you something from the bar?

305
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,420
请给我一杯金汤力
You know what? I will have a gin and tonic, please.

306
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,840
-好的  -谢谢
- Very well. - Thank you.

307
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,020
好选择
Nice choice.

308
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,840
你又是为什么呢
And what's your excuse?

309
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,620
我喜欢午餐时喝酒罢了
I just like drinking at lunch.

310
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,710
跳蚤市场的正式报价是今天吗
So, the official SwapMeet offer is happening today?

311
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,980
是的  今天下午就交给约翰·博斯沃思了
Yes, John Bosworth is taking it over later this afternoon.

312
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,460
-太激动了  -是啊
- Exciting. - Yeah.

313
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,420
他会跟你和卡梅伦一起去吗
Will he go over with you and Cameron?

314
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,930
不  他是我们的代理人
No, he's our advance man.

315
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,180
他会打理好一切的
He's taking care of it.

316
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,180
-女士们  可以点餐了  -老样子  杰森
- Whenever the ladies are ready. - The usual, Jason.

317
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,010
烤炙鸡块
Chicken paillard.

318
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,590
很脆薄  但依然多汁
It's thin, crispy, and somehow still juicy.

319
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,780
不知他们是怎么做到的
I don't know how they do it.

320
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,060
我就来一份...
Uh, you know, I will try the...

321
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,050
意大利蘑菇饭吧
mushroom ris-- risotto.

322
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,780
你还戴着戒指呢
You still wear your ring, huh?

323
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,500
工作所需
For work.

324
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,290
男人好像不明白女人可以单身逍遥
Men can't seem to handle the idea that sexual availability

325
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,120
还具备商业头脑
and business acumen can exist in the same body.

326
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,550
这可以省去不少麻烦
It simplifies things.

327
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,960
你说约翰·博斯沃思是你们的代理人
So when you say John Bosworth is your advance man,

328
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,380
是什么意思
what exactly do you mean?

329
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,530
干什么呢
Whatcha doing?

330
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,470
我在跟布伦特研究2.0版
Oh, I'm just working on 2.0 with Brent.

331
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,240
我觉得这事该全员出动
I figured it was all hands on deck,

332
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,250
所以就来帮忙
so I would jump in and help out.

333
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,320
不必  我都有布伦特了
Don't do that. I've already got a Brent.

334
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,760
我雇你不是干那个的
That's not what I hired you for.

335
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,830
等等
Excuse me.

336
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,030
等等我
Excuse me. Wait.

337
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,700
那你为什么雇我
Hey, man, why did you hire me, then?

338
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,990
我也开始觉得疑惑了
I'm beginning to wonder that myself.

339
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,150
我就是...
You know, I just--

340
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,380
我当时并不知道会是这个情况
I didn't know what I was getting myself into.

341
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,720
我是那么想修复一切
You know, and I wanted to fix things so bad,

342
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,410
但是
but, I don't know,

343
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,510
她似乎并不想要我
she just doesn't seem to want me there.

344
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,250
她虽然嘴上说想
I mean, she says she does,

345
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,880
但她只是觉得我想听到那话
but that's what she thinks I want to hear.

346
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,050
等等
Oh, wait.

347
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,100
唐娜
Donna?

348
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,220
我老婆回来了  KC4L下线
That's my wife. This is KC4L signing off.

349
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,030
唐娜
Hey, Donna.

350
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,590
无线电可算调好了
I, uh, finally got the ham working.

351
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,610
你知道我是打算搬出去的吧
You know I was always planning on moving out, right?

352
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,150
这对我来说也并不是理想的安排
Like, this is not exactly an ideal setup for me either.

353
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,520
我也不喜欢听你拉屎
It's not like I like listening to you take a dump.

354
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,350
而且  唐娜从没跟我提过
You know, just for the record, Donna never said anything to me

355
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,340
你们之间的问题
about whatever problems you guys were having.

356
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,030
她绝不会那么做的
She would never do that.

357
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,720
我拿到了通关证
I have the letters of transit.

358
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,830
一份重要文件
A very important document.

359
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,250
跳蚤市场的报价
It's the SwapMeet offer. 

360
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,360
祝你好运  先生
And Godspeed to you, sir.

361
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,720
午餐吃的怎么样
How was lunch?

362
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,650
非常愉快
Extremely delightful.

363
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,520
我吃了炖饭
I had risotto,

364
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,170
就是米饭  但别有风味
which is rice, but not.

365
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,540
你还吃什么了
What else did you have?

366
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,580
我喝了几杯...好几杯金汤力
I had a few-- several gin and tonics.

367
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:56,140
-你没事吧  -我很好
- You okay? - Yes, I'm great.

368
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,210
挺好
Fine.

369
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,580
我前妻以前飞长途
You know, my ex worked those long-haul flights

370
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,100
我出个差一去就半个月
and I was away on business half the month.

371
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,610
我们几乎都不在一起
We barely spent any time together.

372
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,520
但还是能气得对方跳脚
Still managed to get on each other's last nerve.

373
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,990
真不知道你和戈登怎么做到的
I don't know how you and Gordon do it.

374
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,140
看来做得并不很好
Well, apparently, not so well.

375
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,850
你丈夫是挺难搞
I think your husband's all kind of tricky,

376
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,970
但我知道他在乎你
but, by God, I know he cares.

377
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,250
隔着老远就能感觉出来
I can feel it from 50 paces.

378
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,200
还有很多男人干过更糟的事呢  唐娜
There are men out there who've done a lot worse, Donna.

379
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,040
是啊
Yeah.

380
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,150
但这也不算什么好事
But it's hard to turn that into good news.

381
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,070
我要你来参加这次会议
I want you to come to this meeting.

382
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,080
-现在吗  -是的
- Right now? - Right now.

383
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,450
你就是约翰·博斯沃思吧
You must be John Bosworth.

384
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,980
黛安·古德  我今天下午给你打支援
Diane Gould. I'll be your backup this afternoon.

385
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,780
认识你很高兴
Oh, pleasure to meet you.

386
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,780
不知道我还需要人支援
Didn't know I needed backup.

387
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,380
你当然不需要
Well, you don't, of course.

388
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,370
只是我知道你会来
I just knew you'd be here and

389
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,700
觉得我们正好可以认识一下
I thought it would be a nice way for us to meet.

390
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,460
好啊
Sure.

391
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,740
好安静
Seems a little quiet.

392
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,230
我也发现了
Yeah, I noticed that.

393
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,490
停车场也很空
And the parking lot seemed empty.

394
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,880
我也发现了
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

395
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,790
或许我们该去转转
Maybe we should get a tour.

396
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,990
我要把我辛苦挣来的60万给他们
We're giving them 600,000 of my hard-earned dollars

397
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,570
你们公司也要割肉
and a piece of your company.

398
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,280
我们总该有权看看吧
That earns us a poke around.

399
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,520
道格·谢雷登  认识你很高兴
Doug Sheridan. So nice to meet you.

400
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,290
这是我合伙人  克雷格·鲍什
This is my partner Craig Bausch.

401
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,700
你好  我是约翰·博斯沃思
Craig, John Bosworth.

402
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,090
很高兴终于把脸跟名字对上了
Nice to finally put some faces to the names.

403
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,070
这是黛安·古德  我们的合作伙伴
This here is Diane Gould, our partner.

404
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,200
当然  很高兴终于见到你了
Of course. Pleasure to finally meet you.

405
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,960
送份报价这么大阵势
This is quite the delivery committee.

406
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,660
既然我们来了  正好想到处看看
While we're here, we thought we should have a look around.

407
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,470
当然
Oh, of course.

408
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,600
没问题
Sure.

409
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,510
欢迎
Welcome.

410
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,730
我们昨晚熬夜熬到很晚
We pulled a pretty epic all-nighter last night,

411
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,620
所以现在人手很少
so we're kind of down to bare bones.

412
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,690
但能大致了解这里的情况
But you should be able to get a sense of the place.

413
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,140
我知道各位投资人
I know I speak for all the investors

414
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,500
都跟我一样
when I say how delighted we are

415
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:13,650
对个人用户群的增长非常满意
with the growth of the individual user base.

416
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,290
难喝死了
That tastes terrible.

417
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,250
真的...
I mean, that tastes just like... 

418
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,140
我们最初虽然没预料到
Look, we may not have seen it at the start,

419
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,600
但人们的反响说明一切
but the people have spoken

420
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,990
你真的是
and you truly are

421
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:32,030
我们一直看好的思想领袖
the thought leader that we always knew you were.

422
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,230
2.0版
So 2.0.

423
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,350
我们什么时候发布
When are we doing this?

424
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,860
生产部只需几个月就可以准备发货
Well, production can have disks ready to ship in a matter of months.

425
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,880
问题是  收费是
The question is, is it better

426
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,460
从年初就开始
to start charging at the beginning of the year?

427
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,840
还是九月开始
Or do we flip the switch in September

428
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,780
希望收费单
and hope that the charges get

429
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,310
跟返校开销混在一起不被发现
lost in the list of back-to-school expenses?

430
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,520
你觉得呢
What do you think?

431
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:01,780
你觉得我们该什么时候
When do you think we should

432
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,420
开始对新用户版收费
start charging for the new user version?

433
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,730
我...
Well, I--

434
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,100
我以为你不打算收费呢
I mean, I thought you weren't going to charge.

435
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,370
等等
Hold on, I'm--

436
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,090
抱歉  你叫什么来着
I'm sorry, what's your name again?

437
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,290
-莱恩  -对了
- Ryan. - Ryan, right.

438
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,940
我们当然要收费的
Of course we're gonna charge.

439
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,430
培养用户群不就是
I mean, what's the point of developing a user base

440
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,900
为了最终把他们变成付钱的客户吗
if we don't turn them into paying customers at some point?

441
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,880
我认为  这事越早越好
And my gut is telling me sooner rather than later.

442
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,190
真意外
What a surprise.

443
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:36,610
我看到流金子的龙头  就想打开它
I see a spigot and I want to turn it on.

444
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,430
焦点小组调查表明
The focus groups we've done indicate

445
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:41,660
我们将因收费失去30%到40%的用户
we'll be losing 30-40% of our users whenever we do it.

446
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,460
只看你想
It's just a matter of how

447
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,870
在之前把用户群扩展到什么地步了
big you want to grow the base beforehand.

448
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,820
遗憾的是
And, unfortunately,

449
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,900
人们会恨你一阵的
people are going to hate you for a little while.

450
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,220
抱歉  没办法
Sorry, couldn't be helped.

451
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,210
我早就不在乎人们怎么想我了
Well, it's been a long time since I cared what people thought about me.

452
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,900
我认为
My gut says...

453
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,880
九月更好
September.

454
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,860
零售价是多少
What's our price point?

455
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,900
如果能控制在15美元大关以下
If we can stay below the $15 threshold,

456
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,460
用户似乎愿意付费
consumers seem willing to shine it on.

457
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,330
好高啊  不能控制在10美元以下吗
Oof, that sounds awfully high. Can't we keep it under 10?

458
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:10,290
不  这种一次性的年费
No, the fact is for a one-time annual expense of this kind--

459
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,770
14.95元呗
$14.95.

460
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,960
是啊  这个好
Yes. That.

461
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,290
就这个
That right there. That--

462
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:20,300
我同意  很好
that has my vote. Yes, please.

463
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,380
你觉得呢
What do you think?

464
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,470
嗯
Yeah, I-I guess

465
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,780
14.95元挺不错的
$14.95 sounds good.

466
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:40,040
既然莱恩都同意了
Well, if Ryan's on board, huh?

467
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,090
那就这样了
So that's it.

468
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,430
到九月  我们就收费  14.95美元
Come September, we start charging $14.95.

469
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,330
-你没事吧  -嗯
- You okay? - Yeah, of course.

470
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:04,630
我知道这不好受
Look, I know it tastes bad,

471
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,890
但这么做是对的
but this is the right move.

472
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,860
我保证
I promise you, all right?

473
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,210
我能进来吗
Can I come in?

474
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,050
怎么了
What is it?

475
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,020
我
Hey, I--

476
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:50,260
我想说  尽管雇佣代码的原始编写者
I just wanted to say that even though it does make perfect sense

477
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,420
是合理的选择
to hire the person who wrote that code,

478
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,910
但我并不知道你跟他的事
I didn't realize that that was someone that you had a thing with.

479
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,200
如果我今天早些时候显得不近人情
So if I seemed insensitive earlier today,

480
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,070
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

481
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,630
好吧
Okay.

482
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,650
那个...代码是我和汤姆一起写的
And just-- Tom and I wrote that code together.

483
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,450
就是想告诉你一声
Just, you know, FYI.

484
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,140
并不是他一个人干的
It wasn't all him.

485
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,290
好
Okay.

486
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,660
希望我没有让你觉得
And I hope I didn't make you feel

487
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,410
你住在这里是我们一切问题的根源
like you living here is the cause of all of our problems.

488
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,020
你不会开始跟我说你妻子的事吧
You're not gonna start talking to me about your wife, are you?

489
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,070
不会
No, I'm not.

490
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,550
因为...我真心觉得我没法面对这个
Just 'cause I really-- I don't think I can handle that.

491
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,390
听着  我依然觉得
Look, I still don't think

492
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,220
我们不该住在一个屋檐下
that we should all be living under the same roof,

493
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,600
但显然  还有其他的问题
but obviously there's something else going on.

494
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,840
我只想说这个
That's all I wanted to say.

495
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,000
你们什么时候搬出去呢
So when are you guys moving out?

496
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,320
天呐  你把全家的杯子都拿进来了啊
Jesus, you got every goddamn mug in the house in here.

497
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,570
才没有
No, I don't.

498
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,220
好吧  今晚好运
All right. Hey, good luck tonight.

499
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,690
你也是
You, too.

500
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,310
我真不懂风怎么吹进烛台球场的
I just don't understand how the wind gets into Candlestick.

501
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,170
这不是有墙的吗
I mean, there are walls. 

502
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:13,470
风是巨人队的球迷  想干啥干啥
Wind's a Giants fan. It does what it needs to do.

503
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,830
不比阿灵顿的蒸笼强多了
It beats the hell out of sweating bullets in Arlington.

504
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,550
所以我是休斯顿球迷
Yeah, well, that's why I'm a Houston fan.

505
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:20,090
空调吹得像天堂
Air conditioning like God intended it.

506
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,540
诺兰·莱恩把
Where was God when Nolan Ryan

507
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,070
威尔·克拉克晾在一边时上帝在哪呢
left that one hanging for Will Clark the other day?

508
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,180
不去接一下吗
You want to get that?

509
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,900
没事
No, it's fine.

510
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,460
这事更重要
This is more important.

511
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:39,720
多谢你们这么重视
Yeah, hey, we appreciate the extra attention,

512
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,540
但你们没有接待员吗
but don't you fellas have a receptionist?

513
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,200
当然有  她去吃午饭了
Of course we do. She's at lunch.

514
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,410
-吃晚了  -我们常跟东岸做生意
- Late lunch. - We do a lot of business with the East Coast.

515
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,500
我们常会午餐时间工作
So we work through lunch a lot and then we,

516
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,970
之后再吃
you know, have it later.

517
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,070
谁去接下电话
Can somebody answer the goddamn phone?

518
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,110
大家昨晚都累坏了
Everybody's really spent from last night.

519
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,630
真是筋疲力尽
It was a real ball-breaker.

520
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,120
嗯
Yeah.

521
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,230
好吧
Sure.

522
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,870
你这是干什么
What'd you do that for?

523
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,820
我不喜欢这个
Oh, I'm not comfortable with it.

524
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,800
这数字是我们依据
No, it was a figure that was arrived at

525
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,700
不怎么及时的信息得出的
when we were operating with less than current information.

526
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,390
我们公司的价值在于我们的知识产权
The value of our company is in our intellectual property,

527
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,250
以及忠实的用户  而不在办公室里
our loyal customers, it's not out there.

528
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,310
可不是嘛  走吧
No, it sure as hell isn't. Come on.

529
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,930
这是要去哪
Where are you going?

530
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,010
我们得重新考虑
Oh, we need to reassess.

531
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,560
博斯沃思先生  我保证  你要买下的公司
Mr. Bosworth, I assure you the company you're bidding on

532
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,390
是其自身的精简版
is a lean, mean version of itself.

533
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,330
绝对是够精简  也就值40万吧
Oh, I'd say it's a lean, mean version worth about 400K.

534
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,070
40万是个不错的起价
400,000 sounds like a good place to start.

535
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,320
不  是终价才对  孩子
No, it sounds like a good place to finish, son.

536
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,510
如果你们找得到
If you can find someone willing

537
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,440
愿给35万以上的  就去找他们吧
to pay north of 350, you should go for it.

538
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,040
-等等  他说40的  -抱歉  我的错
- Wait, he just said 400. - Oh, I'm sorry. My mistake.

539
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,340
32.5万  如何
325, how's that sound? 

540
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,030
我们替你省了25万
We just saved you $250,000.

541
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,420
你怎么不开心点
I'd think you'd be happier.

542
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,690
我很开心
I am happy, very.

543
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,250
我就是有点意外
I'm just a little surprised

544
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,380
你完全没按计划的来
by how completely off-book you went.

545
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,180
我以为这次就是寒暄一番就成交了
I thought this was supposed to be handshakes and how do you dos.

546
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,700
看到机会就该抓住嘛
You see an opportunity, you take it.

547
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,550
乐趣就在此
That's the sport of it.

548
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,070
也可能是另一种结果
It could have gone the other way.

549
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,010
但并不是
But it didn't.

550
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,750
麦克米伦先生
Mr. MacMillan?

551
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:11,450
我想说
Uh, I just wanted to say that--

552
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,230
我觉得你不该对用户版收费
that I don't think you should charge for the user version.

553
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,940
你怎么不在会上说
Why didn't you say that in the meeting?

554
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,050
我来这里才一周
I've been here for, what, a week

555
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,300
你就让我参加高级员工会议
and you plunk me down in some senior staff meeting.

556
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,760
我还能说什么  当然是随声附和了
What was I supposed to say? I just agreed with everyone else.

557
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:30,180
但是我不该那样  因为我并不是那么想的
But that's not right because it's not what I think.

558
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,090
很遗憾你在会上发懵了
I'm sorry you couldn't keep up in the meeting.

559
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:38,670
你向人们承诺你不会收钱的
You made a promise to people that you wouldn't charge them.

560
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,270
我没说今后也不收
I didn't promise that I wouldn't ever charge them.

561
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,650
你就是说了
Of course you did.

562
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,570
你说摆脱恐惧是种权利
You said freedom from fear is a right

563
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,070
人们不该为此付钱
and you shouldn't have to pay for it.

564
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,900
在完美世界里  确实如此
And in a perfect world that would be true,

565
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,240
但我们生活的世界并非如此
but it's not the world we live in.

566
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,990
-那你为什么那么说  -因为我是那么想的
- Then why'd you say it? - Because I believe it.

567
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,980
但我有董事会和投资者
But I've got a board and investors

568
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,440
还有我需要听命于的人
and I've got people to answer to.

569
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
但你会毁了这个产品
But you're ruining the product.

570
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,840
我就是产品本身
I am the product.

571
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,140
我知道
I know.

572
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,540
不  我是奥斯汀理工大学的
No, I was at Austin Tech.

573
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,410
我没毕业  就开始工作了
I never really finished, but then I started working

574
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,460
后来就没时间回去完成学业了
and there was just no real time to go back.

575
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,740
再次感谢你来
Thanks again for coming.

576
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,830
嗯
Yeah.

577
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,430
可以开始了
Feel free to start.

578
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,370
这次不吻我了吗
What, no kiss this time?

579
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,220
你想怎么样
What do you want?

580
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,910
你要说我是个烂人吗  说吧
You gonna tell me I'm a horrible person? Go ahead.

581
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,230
我也有权这么说
I'd be well within my rights to want that.

582
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,520
但我真心想说的
What I'd really like to say is--

583
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,430
是谢谢你
is thank you.

584
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,750
是吗
Really?

585
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,020
谢什么
For what?

586
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,240
一切吧
Everything, I guess.

587
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,560
如果不是你把一切烧成了灰
How could I have risen from the ashes

588
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,850
我又怎么能涅槃重生
if you hadn't burned it all to the ground?

589
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,760
所以你挖走了我最好的程序员吗
Is that why you stole my best coder?

590
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,740
莱恩吗  得了
Who, Ryan? Come on.

591
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,440
硅谷里莱恩这种人多得是
The Valley is crawling with Ryans.

592
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,710
才不是  他是很有才的
No, actually, he's incredibly talented.

593
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,130
你想要回他吗
Do you want him back?

594
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:06,130
你来干什么  你跟踪我来的吗
What are you doing here? Did you follow me here?

595
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:09,800
不  卡梅  我没那个时间
No, Cam, I don't have time to follow you.

596
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,630
我
I'm a--

597
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,960
是这儿的学生
I'm a student.

598
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,740
有什么好笑的
Why is that funny?

599
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,800
因为你在撒谎
Because it's a lie.

600
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,310
或许我是厌倦了别人说我
Well, maybe I got tired of being told

601
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,710
只是个不会代码的推销员
I was just a salesman who couldn't code.

602
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,430
好吧
Okay.

603
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,890
我...
I--

604
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,990
天呐  我不知道你在玩什么扮装游戏
God, I don't know what kind of dress-up game you're playing,

605
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,200
但你真是个学生
but, yes, you're a student.

606
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,490
我可能永远不会精于这个
I might not ever be great at it, but...

607
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,420
但我也是能学的
I'm not unteachable.

608
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,630
乔
Joe,

609
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,600
我知道你这副
I know you got this whole

610
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,720
谦逊禅师的样子挺受欢迎
humble Zen master thing working for you,

611
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,020
但得了
but come on.

612
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,340
省省吧
Save it.

613
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,830
我才不会信呢
I'm not buying it.

614
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,470
你不非得信  卡梅
You don't have to buy it, Cam.

615
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,960
你没听说吗
Haven't you heard?

616
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,670
我要免费送出我的产品
I'm giving it away for free.

617
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,460
卡梅
Cam.

618
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,080
卡梅
Cam.

619
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,040
他们昨晚怎么样
How were they last night?

620
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,660
我没看到他们
I didn't see them.

621
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,260
我回到家时他们已经回房了
They were in their room when I got home 

622
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,170
早上我走时他们已经走了
and gone before I left this morning.

623
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,670
挺安静的
It was quiet.

624
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,310
那并不总是个好兆头
Yeah, that's not always a good sign.

625
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,790
总比大吼大叫强
Well, it's better than screaming.

626
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,210
我听过让人恨不得大叫的安静
I've heard quiet make you beg for screaming.

627
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,580
放好了
Put that there. 

628
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:13,500
我想为我昨天的爆发道歉
I want to apologize for my outburst yesterday.

629
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,450
非常不合适
It was totally inappropriate.

630
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,170
也不该发生那种事
And it shouldn't have happened.

631
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:23,540
如果我让谁不舒服了
So if I made anyone feel uncomfortable,

632
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,700
那么很抱歉
then I'm sorry.

633
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:31,390
这段话才让我不舒服呢
Well, that little speech made me very uncomfortable.

634
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,560
-开玩笑的  -就当没那回事
- I'm kidding. - It never happened.

635
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,910
-得了  -怎么
- Come on. - What?

636
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,100
-就是有那回事嘛  -就是个说法
- It so clearly did. - It's a thing you say.

637
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,220
好了  我们不用再说那件事了
Okay, look, we don't have to discuss this ad nauseam,

638
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,650
我们只是觉得什么都不说也不好
but we thought saying nothing seemed equally stupid.

639
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,220
所以决定至少说点什么
So we're saying something.

640
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,910
我们知道把婚姻关系带到工作中来
We are aware that bringing a marriage into the workplace

641
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,890
是很复杂的  我们在尽力了  好吗
is complicated and we're doing the best we can, okay?

642
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,910
我们继续工作吧
Now, can we try to get back to where we were?

643
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,520
好的
Okay, great.

644
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,830
莱恩的空缺
The big Ryan-shaped hole.

645
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,880
你昨晚找到合适人选了吗
Did you find any prospects last night?

646
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,610
没有  但我决定不用雇其他人了
No, but I decided we don't need anyone.

647
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,200
-当然用了  -不用
- Of course we do. - No.

648
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,160
我来做不就行了
Not if I do it.

649
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:10,230
这好吗  我觉得你已经很忙了
Oh, I don't know. I feel like you're already spread pretty thin.

650
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:13,450
不  他说得对  找原本编写代码的人
No, he was right. Getting the person who originated the code

651
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,230
是最合理的  那就是我
makes the most sense. That's me.

652
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:16,760
但你该找点帮手啊
Well, but you should have some help.

653
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,820
我们刚买了家公司  找他们来帮忙呗
We just bought a company. Maybe one of them can help.

654
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,070
不  我还得跟他们解释一切
No! Look, I'd just have to explain everything to them.

655
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,550
那样我事倍功半
It makes double the work for me.

656
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,090
好吧  如果你觉得你能行的话
All right, if you think you can handle it.

657
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,290
我能行
Yes, I can.

658
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,710
好  我们接到电话
Okay, so we got a call--

659
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:35,180
不是吧  这就进入下一话题了
You got to be kidding me. You're moving on?

660
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,260
是啊  你有什么想说的吗
Yes. Did you have something you wanted to say?

661
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,710
没有  继续吧  是你们的会议
No. No, no, go ahead. It's your meeting.

662
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,220
-我们接到电话  -她不能自己做
- We got a call-- - She can't do it herself.

663
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,500
这家公司本就在花三分之一的时间等她了
The company spends a third of its time waiting for her as it is.

664
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,630
他没说错  你把工作分出去点有好处
He's not wrong. You could do a bit more delegating.

665
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,200
我有分派  我只是觉得
I do, just not when it's

666
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,210
这件事是我们的基础
something that I think is truly foundational.

667
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:00,220
你觉得什么事都是我们的基础
But you think that everything is foundational.

668
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,510
既然她说她能做到  她就能做到
Look, if she says she can handle it, she can handle it.

669
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,330
天呐  天呐  天呐
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

670
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,330
戈登  你究竟什么意思
Gordon, what is your argument?

671
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,260
你这样会毁了公司的  老是这样...
You're just sinking the company by taking on all these--

672
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,110
-她才没有毁什么  -我们能不能说主题
- No, she's not sinking anything. - Can we please just focus?

673
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,730
收拾你的东西
I want you to pack up your stuff.

674
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,780
明天开始  我们在我家工作
Starting tomorrow, we'll be working out of my place.

675
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,960
如果2.0版我们还想不收费
If we're not charging for 2.0,

676
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,160
就得找个新的收入源
we've got to find a new income stream.

677
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,750
别笑  我们可能会失败
Don't smile. We might fail.

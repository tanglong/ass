46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,920
你的代码到处都在循环
Your code loops all over the place.

47
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,870
毫无结构可言  就没有人能维护
It's not structured. It's not maintainable by anyone.

48
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,970
-我不同意  -还有重入分叉
- I disagree. - There are reentrant forks,

49
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,250
根本看不出哪一条是调用函数
no way of knowing which branch invoked a function.

50
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,720
C++都不这么用了
We don't do that in C++.

51
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,650
已经被C++淘汰了
It's officially deprecated in the language.

52
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,380
我可以维护  每一样都有自己的状态标记
I can maintain it. There are condition flags for everything.

53
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,590
也没有无效代码
There's no one-way arrow.

54
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,800
这就是你想干的事吗
Is that what you want to do?

55
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,840
专门当这堆废物的修理工
Be the code grunt for this sick piece of choss?

56
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,240
道格  镇定
Dougie, chill.

57
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,460
我的人会做逻辑流程图  我来标记
My guys will flow chart it. I'll write out the flags...

58
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,870
我相信你可以
I'm sure you will.

59
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,430
你的流程图就能绕死人  根本一团乱麻
The flow chart would strangle us. It's a mess.

60
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,660
而且什么叫你的人
And what do you mean your guys?

61
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,220
它很快  而且能用
It's fast and it fits.

62
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,640
它已经没必要了
It's no longer necessary.

63
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,900
道格  是我们买了你的公司
Doug, we bought your company.

64
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,740
你得适应我们的编程语言
You should adapt to our programming language.

65
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,240
我知道重编很烦人
I know it sucks to be rewritten.

66
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,630
毫无道理可言
It doesn't make sense.

67
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,820
简直是要让跑车改装成马车
It's like asking a race car to adapt to a covered wagon.

68
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,530
-真文艺  -也许我们都应该
- Poetic. - Maybe we should all try to,

69
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,250
放下自负看问题
you know, take our egos out of it.

70
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,370
我很乐意放下我的自负
Well, my ego would love to have a good night's sleep,

71
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,870
但很不幸  我还得要它改写你的代码
but sadly it has to rewrite your code first.

72
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,110
天哪
Yikes.

73
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,730
黛安  我很抱歉
Diane, I am so sorry.

74
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,630
等扎到人就不好玩了
It's all fun and games till someone gets stabbed in the cheek.

75
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,100
我只是来看看
I'm just here to observe.

76
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,230
好吧
Okay, well...

77
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,670
我想我们已经解决了分歧
I think we're all on the same page now.

78
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,800
没错  很接近了
Definitely. Um, we're really close.

79
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,870
也许能用上这个
Maybe this'll help.

80
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,860
这是整合路径图
It's an integration road map.

81
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,460
我们认为你建立穆特尼的方式很棒
Look, we think the way you created Mutiny was brilliant.

82
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,060
原始的代码块确实很有创意
The original block of code was truly innovative.

83
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,420
但是
Mm-hmm, but?

84
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,990
但跟我们跳蚤市场的代码不合
It doesn't play nice with our SwapMeet code.

85
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,020
如果你那块稍加改动
If you make some changes to that block

86
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,010
我们也调整一下我们的C++
and we make some changes to our C++...

87
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,690
全是错误  凭原始代码
It's a bug factory. The old code makes it impossible

88
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,690
无法跟踪我们的重入循环
to keep track of the reentrant looping.

89
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,430
但我不需要面向对象的语言  好吧
But I don't need the object-oriented language, okay?

90
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,760
我靠脑子就能追踪循环
I can keep track of the looping in my head.

91
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,650
我懂了  你就那么牛
Oh, I get it. You're that good.

92
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,410
没错  就那么牛  你不是吗
Yeah, I am. Aren't you?

93
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,970
正四下张望呢  然后
...looking all around and then

94
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,150
他从拖车侧面走出来
he came around the side of the trailer there.

95
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,010
我发誓  他说
And I swear to God, he goes,

96
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,050
"老兄  那不是熊  那是你前妻"
"Man, that ain't no bear. That's your ex-wife."

97
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,370
之前的事都是她干的
She was just doing the whole thing.

98
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,320
你们没约吗
Oh, you surprised to see her?

99
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:02,880
没约
Yeah.

100
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,980
别了  朋友
Adios, amiga.

101
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,460
好啊
Hey there.

102
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,020
来吧  请  你先
Here, go ahead. After you.

103
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,180
谢谢
Thank you.

104
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,170
祝好  女士们
Good day, ladies.

105
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,850
真是惊喜呢
Well, this is a nice surprise.

106
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,210
我刚好在附近
I was in the neighborhood.

107
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,400
跟跳蚤市场的人处得如何
So, how's it going with the SwapMeet guys?

108
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,930
挺好
Good.

109
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,590
你电话上也是这么说
You keep telling me that on the phone

110
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,880
但声音里都透着不确定
with that same not-so-sure thing you do with your voice.

111
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,830
什么不确定
What not-so-sure thing?

112
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,270
我刚刚旁观了他们的项目会
Anyway, I just popped into their project meeting.

113
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,130
闹得很僵
The vibe was pretty hostile.

114
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,350
你怎么不告诉我呢
Why haven't you told me?

115
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,380
因为正在做嘛
Well, it's a work in progress.

116
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,350
-唐娜  -我知道
- Donna. - I know.

117
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,430
卡梅跟他们还没磨合好
Cam isn't comfortable with the guys yet,

118
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,920
我会处理的
and I'm working on it.

119
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,990
-你打算怎么处理  -那个
- How are you working on it? - Well--

120
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,420
我的意思是  应该我们一起来处理
My point is, we should be working on it.

121
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,770
如果有问题  我们就该解决它
If there are issues, we need to air them out.

122
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,060
否则不满情绪积累恶化
Otherwise resentment festers

123
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,730
一切都会完蛋
and the whole thing starts to rot.

124
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,630
好吧  不如这样
All right, how about this?

125
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,010
今晚我们一起吃饭
We could all go to dinner tonight,

126
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,710
喝点葡萄酒  聊聊清楚
have some wine, talk things through.

127
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,370
-我喜欢葡萄酒  -很好
- I do like wine. - Great.

128
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,820
但今晚不行
But I can't do tonight.

129
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,560
我要去参加个慈善晚会
I've got tickets to a charity thing,

130
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,960
为拯救海湾募捐
a fundraiser for Save the Bay.

131
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,920
-听上去...  -很糟
- Oh, that sounds-- - Terrible.

132
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,380
我本来想说很有爱
I was gonna say lovely.

133
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,440
我的同伴刚取消了  我可以带个伴儿
My date just cancelled and I have a plus one.

134
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,910
我可以问问戈登
I could check with Gordon,

135
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,540
看看他今晚能不能照看孩子们
see if he could watch the girls tonight.

136
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,050
不是
No, um...

137
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,960
我是想邀请约翰·博斯沃思
I was thinking about John Bosworth.

138
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,280
这样啊...
I mean...

139
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,180
真的吗
really?

140
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,400
"那不是熊  是我前妻"
"Man, that ain't no bear. That's my ex-wife."

141
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,190
会有一堆硅谷的大人物在那儿
You know, there'll be a whole slew of Valley big shots there.

142
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,400
对于约翰来说是个建立商业关系的好机会
It's a great opportunity for John to make some business connections.

143
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,620
当然
Sure.

144
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,130
但是
But...

145
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,160
没人叫他约翰
nobody calls him John.

146
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,300
我就这么叫
I do.

147
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,810
好了  各位
All right, guys.

148
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,930
各位
Guys.

149
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,170
各位  安静  安静
Guys, please, please!

150
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,060
闭嘴  小屁孩
Yo, shut up, kid!

151
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,030
好了  我知道我们开局不顺
All right, I know we've gotten off to a rough start,

152
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,260
为此我很抱歉
and I'm sorry about that.

153
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,450
这话太轻描淡写了
That's the understatement of the century.

154
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,740
自从卡梅接手当主程序员后
We're in a bit of a holding pattern

155
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,920
我们就基本停滞不前
ever since Cam took over for our lead coder.

156
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,990
-她就是仿生人  -你什么都不懂
- Yeah, that was gynoid. - You don't know jack about it.

157
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,050
但我们要以此为契机
But we're gonna use this as an opportunity.

158
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,200
我们已成功地绘制了两个系统的流程图
Now, I know we've had some success flowcharting the two systems.

159
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,790
我们的组织培训模式进展如何
How are we doing with our organizational training objectives?

160
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,970
你是说结伴体系吗
Oh, you mean the buddy system?

161
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,830
培训这些蠢蛋就是噩梦
It's a nightmare trying to train these jokers.

162
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,760
他们就不停抱怨C++
All they want to do is bitch about C++.

163
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,950
C++
C++.

164
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,920
他就成天跟着我  做他那套愚蠢的动作
He just follows me around all day doing this idiotic routine.

165
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,340
-C++  -卡尔  他是你带的实习生
- C++. - Carl, he's your trainee, okay?

166
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,960
-我才不管  -卡尔主人  我被预设成
- I don't care. - Master Carl, I've been programmed

167
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,400
-观察你的一举一动  -好吧
- to observe your every move... - Okay.

168
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,860
好通过你不甚完美的言行
So I may learn from your flawed behavior

169
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,250
学习如何当人类
what it is to be human.

170
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,130
闭嘴  闭嘴
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

171
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,580
这一点都不好笑
He's not even funny.

172
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,850
博迪  别再针对他了
Bodie, stop antagonizing him, okay?

173
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,130
-哔哔  -你给我滚
- Beep-boop-beep. - Get out of my face!

174
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,260
干掉这群混蛋
Let's kill these a-holes!

175
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,850
冷静
Calm down!

176
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,980
我去  你没事吧
Oh, shit. You okay?

177
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,410
大家都坐下
Everyone, sit down.

178
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,720
到底怎么
What the f--?

179
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,560
看到没  真是个好房子
You see? It is just so charming.

180
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,300
线脚都是原始的
It has all the original molding.

181
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,300
还有土生土长的霉菌
And all the original mold.

182
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,460
后院也很好  很适合烧烤
And the backyard is adorable. It's perfect for barbecues.

183
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,390
你听到了吗
Oh, did you hear that?

184
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,250
那我让你和你的  朋友
Okay, why don't I give you and your, uh, friend

185
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,750
谈一下吧
a minute to talk?

186
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,000
谢谢
Thanks.

187
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,490
她以为我俩是一对
She thinks we're a couple.

188
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,270
你不是我的菜
You're not my type.

189
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,500
这地方有自己的特点
Yeah, this place has character.

190
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,140
不是千篇一律的样子
This isn't a generic box.

191
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,170
不  穆特尼的房子才有特点
No, the Mutiny house had character.

192
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,130
这里只是古怪
This place is just quaint.

193
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,380
我们看的每套房子你都讨厌
You've hated every place we've seen.

194
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,820
那又怎样  我很挑的
So? I'm picky.

195
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,610
每个地方的感觉都不对
And nothing feels right.

196
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,720
是因为房子还是其他什么事
Is this about the house or is this something else?

197
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,540
是因为一号和二号
It's Thing One and Thing Two.

198
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,650
天哪  我受不了他俩
God, I can't stand them.

199
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,990
尤其是大块头那个  傲慢的兄弟会成员
Especially the bigger Thing, this arrogant frat boy.

200
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,590
小的那个还凑合
The smaller Thing's not so bad.

201
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,890
你知道他们的名字
You know their names.

202
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,860
是  半斤和八两
Yes, Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

203
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,490
哈克和杰克  庸人和庸才
Heckle and Jeckle. Frick and Frack.

204
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,940
我懂了  但他们想帮忙的
I get it. But they want to be useful.

205
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,360
怎么帮
By what?

206
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,710
把所有东西都转换成C++吗
Translating everything into C++?

207
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,680
唐娜  如果我知道计划是这样
Donna, if I knew that was the plan,

208
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,820
我不会签字同意的
I wouldn't have signed on.

209
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,580
但我们已经签了
But we did sign on.

210
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,720
他们俩跟公司有两年的合约
The guys are under a two-year contract

211
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,030
占有公司股份  我们跟他们绑在一起了
with a piece of the company. We married them.

212
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,600
我们得趁恶化
We have to sit down and talk it out

213
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,520
完蛋前  坐下来谈清楚
before the whole thing festers and rots.

214
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,680
-明晚我们一起吃饭  -什么
- We're having dinner tomorrow night. - What?

215
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,170
真是个可怕的主意  谁提议的
That's a horrible idea. Who suggested that?

216
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,620
我
I did.

217
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,970
太好了
Oh, great.

218
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,110
你这只是通知我
And so now you're just informing me.

219
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,400
看到了吗  已经有家的感觉了
See? It already feels like home.

220
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,220
麦克米伦实用网络本就是个出发点
MacMillan Utility was always intended to be a jumping-off point.

221
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,900
没错  关键在于转变
Totally. It's all about transformation.

222
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,460
许多公司从一件事起步
Many companies start doing one thing

223
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,240
之后改变方向
and then change direction.

224
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,040
如果我们能找到正确的方向
If we can just find the right vector.

225
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,130
那我们的免费软件就能一直免费
Then our freeware can stay free.

226
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,140
路由器技术很有前景
Router tech is promising.

227
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,380
思科在这方面已经走在很前面了
Ah, Cisco's already way ahead on that one.

228
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,130
三维图形  人工智能
Uh, 3-D graphics. Uh, AI.

229
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:55,820
第五代系统
5th gen systems.

230
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,440
那耗费巨大且将毫无结果
It's a billion-dollar road to nowhere.

231
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,930
一年就得完
I give it a year.

232
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,390
费尔柴德之前做照相机
Fairchild made cameras.

233
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,780
现在他们做半导体
Now they make semiconductors.

234
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,340
科乐早期叫康涅狄格州皮革公司
Coleco was the Connecticut Leather Company.

235
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,800
现在他们做电子游戏
Now they make video games.

236
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,610
穆特尼作为游戏公司起步
Yeah, and Mutiny started as a games company.

237
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,630
-闭嘴  -抱歉
- Shut up. - Sorry,

238
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,730
能参与你的思考过程我太激动了
I'm just so stoked to be a part of your process.

239
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,610
-加上咖啡因  -不  我是说安静
- Plus the caffeine... - No, I mean be quiet.

240
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,060
闭嘴
Now.

241
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,640
拜托
Please.

242
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,860
好吧
Okay.

243
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,880
我们来回顾那五个最好的主意
Let's circle the five best ideas.

244
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,370
等等  你干什么呢  伙计
Wait, what-- what are you doing, man?

245
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,990
我们花了好几周研究出来的
We spent weeks on that.

246
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,580
这里可有不少好点子啊
There's some good stuff there.

247
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,070
"好"是"伟大"的敌人
Good is the enemy of great.

248
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,540
要是有什么值得深讨的点子
If anything's worth pursuing,

249
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,230
我们明天照样记得起来
we'll remember it tomorrow.

250
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:01,060
{\an9}BGM: Beyond Belief

251
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,390
进来...
Come in...

252
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,760
如果你非得进来
if you must.

253
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,900
我们能谈谈吗
Can we talk for a minute?

254
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,810
好吧
I guess.

255
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,590
我知道我们关系一开始就不怎么好
Look, I know we got off on the wrong foot.

256
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,370
我们的目标是一致的  对吧
I mean, we all want the same thing, right?

257
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,480
是的
Yeah.

258
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,460
也许我们...
Maybe we...

259
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,160
进展得太快了
got into this too quickly,

260
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,510
但是没错  我们既然都在一起了
but, yeah, let's-- we're in it now, so...

261
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,570
如果你觉得太快了
If you think it was too quick,

262
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,470
那可是多亏了你的博斯
you have your man Bos to thank.

263
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,010
-他逼我们接受协议的  -真的吗
- He strong-armed us into taking the deal. - Really?

264
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,350
因为我可是听说你
'Cause I heard that you

265
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,460
-和格雷格故意虚报  -是克雷格
- and Greg misrepresented... - It's Craig.

266
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,650
公司价值  想骗我们多花钱
...the value of your company to lure us into overpaying.

267
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,920
你怎么回事
What's your deal?

268
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,490
你为什么这么难与人合作
Why do you have such a hard time playing with others?

269
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,530
你生来就是这样  还是你的哪个废柴前男友
Were you born this way or did some loser ex-boyfriend

270
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,500
把你变成了仇男的贱人
turn you into a man-hating bitch?

271
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,810
什么事
What?

272
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,040
凯瑟琳  是你吗
Catherine? Is that you?

273
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,590
-是的  -我是伦恩
- Yes. - It's Len.

274
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,320
怎么了
What's wrong?

275
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,700
没什么  只是...抱歉打扰你工作了
Nothing, just-- sorry to call you at work.

276
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,640
我想告诉你你妈妈...
I wanted to let you know your mom...

277
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,870
怎么了
What?

278
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,710
你妈妈和我准备卖房子
Your mom and I are selling the house.

279
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,500
在迈阿密郊区买个小公寓
Bought a little condo outside of Miami.

280
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,950
我们得把车库里的那些破烂都处理掉
We gotta get rid of all that crap in the garage.

281
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,800
你想要你爸的东西吗
Do-- do you want your dad's stuff?

282
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,470
你妈妈特意为你留的  但是  要去迈阿密嘛
Your mom saved it for you, but, you know, Miami.

283
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,880
我们准备把所有剩的东西趁国庆节周末卖掉
We're gonna sell everything that's left over 4th of July weekend.

284
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,750
我希望你能来看看
I was hoping you might come and take a look,

285
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,080
跟你妈妈问个好
say hello to your mother.

286
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,480
情况已经不一样了
It's not like it used to be.

287
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,520
她现在好多了
She's much better now.

288
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,290
那为什么她不打给我
then why didn't she call?

289
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,940
希望你在那儿一切顺利
I hope you're doing well out there.

290
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,200
我会告诉你妈我们聊过了
I'll let your mom know that we talked.

291
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,510
你必须得道歉
You need to apologize.

292
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,120
你只要说一句"对不起"就行了
All you have to do is say, "I'm sorry," That's it.

293
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,870
我要道多少次歉才行
How many times have I gotta try?

294
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,570
-天啊  -等下  道格
- God. - Wait, Doug!

295
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,040
你们怎么了
Hey, what was that about?

296
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,060
只是我们梦幻的合作关系的日常摩擦
Oh, just the usual ups and downs of a magical partnership.

297
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,400
你待到好晚啊
You're here late.

298
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,400
不过你好像总是很晚才走
But then you're probably always here late.

299
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,170
你是在说我没有私生活吗
Are you implying that I don't have a life?

300
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,180
是的
Yes.

301
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:27,260
可以说道格和我风格不同
You could say that Doug and I have different styles.

302
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,730
可不是
No shit.

303
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,250
他刚进我办公室说我是个贱人
He just walked into my office and called me a bitch.

304
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,290
我很抱歉
I am so sorry.

305
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,760
听着  我们都很高兴能成为穆特尼的一员
Look, we're really excited to be part of Mutiny.

306
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,220
只是跳蚤市场是我们的心血
It's just SwapMeet was our baby.

307
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,380
我觉得道格依然在为出售而难过
I think Doug still feels down about having to sell.

308
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,230
但那不是借口
But that's no excuse.

309
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,130
你想看点很酷的东西吗
You want to see something cool?

310
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,590
是尸体吗
Is it a dead body?

311
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,840
如果道格还在的话
Only if Doug's still here.

312
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,340
你确定这样做好吗
You sure this is okay?

313
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,190
他不会介意的
He won't mind.

314
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,560
我能问你个问题吗
Can I ask you something?

315
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,470
问吧
Okay.

316
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,700
为什么你不愿改动原始的PL/M代码块
Why won't you change that original block of PL/M?

317
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,790
那是仅剩的我自己写的程序
It's the only piece left that I wrote by myself.

318
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,560
我一个人在卧室里做的
Alone in my bedroom, just me.

319
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,440
那时候只有我自己
Back when this whole place was just me.

320
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,570
所有时序都是我亲手完成的
I did all the timings by hand,

321
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,010
我用检查循环检查了
I checked the status on every buffer

322
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,250
每一个缓冲和每一次键盘输入的状态
and every keystroke every time, all with check loops.

323
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,680
很快而且...
It was fast and it was...

324
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,810
很美妙
Beautiful.

325
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,670
它很美妙
It is beautiful.

326
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,840
是啊
Yeah.

327
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,680
你要我说什么呢
And what do you want me to say?

328
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,490
我为这里感到骄傲
I-- I'm proud of this place.

329
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,850
但那个时候  都没人知道
But back then, it was this secret.

330
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,460
只有我自己
It was all mine.

331
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,980
那就别改它了
Then we should leave it alone.

332
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,880
我刚刚接到了十分奇怪的电话
Just got the weirdest phone call.

333
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,750
我继父
My stepfather.

334
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,270
他和我妈要搬去佛罗里达
I guess he and my mom are moving to Florida.

335
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,560
他们要把我爸的东西都卖掉
They're selling all my dad's stuff.

336
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,350
他去世时我九岁
He died when I was nine.

337
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
我去
Shit.

338
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,380
我很遗憾
I'm sorry to hear that.

339
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:41,170
他有辆摩托车
Just he had this motorcycle...

340
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,070
一辆旧哈雷平底锅
an old Panhead Harley.

341
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,490
他经常开着它送我去上学
Oh, he used to ride me to school on it.

342
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,310
我戴着顶巨大的头盔
I'd show up to kindergarten with this, like,

343
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,380
去幼儿园
gigantic helmet.

344
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,210
看上去肯定很傻  但是...
I'm sure it looked ridiculous, but it was--

345
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,290
却让我觉得...
it just felt so...

346
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,640
你应该去把车拿回来
You should go get the bike.

347
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,650
你没考虑过自己办个公司吗
Have you ever considered a solo business venture?

348
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,540
任天堂游戏机不是给琼妮的吗
Wasn't the Nintendo system supposed to be for Joanie?

349
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,820
不  是给全家的
No, it was a family present.

350
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,810
反正  经过了今天的吵闹  我得放松一下
Anyways, I had to unwind after that brawl today.

351
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,550
我真拿那些家伙没办法
I honestly don't know what to do about those guys.

352
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,880
卡迪夫的活儿不好干
Cardiff had its challenges,

353
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,230
但还从没有人打我的耳朵
but no one ever punched me in the ear.

354
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,940
是啊  你已经不在卡迪夫了
Yeah, well, you're not at Cardiff anymore.

355
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,370
这就是答案
There's your answer.

356
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,680
带他们出去  一个个毙掉
Just take the guys out back and shoot 'em.

357
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,760
他从拖车侧面走出来
Well, he comes around the side of the trailer,

358
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,080
然后说  "老兄  那不是熊  是你前妻"
and he goes, "Man, that ain't a bear. That's your ex-wife."

359
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,300
看到了吗  谢谢  谢谢
See? Thank you, thank you.

360
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,740
太疯狂了
Man, it was crazy, man.

361
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,350
我不知道她在那里待了多久了
And I don't know how long she stayed there.

362
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,890
她在那里一整夜了
She was there all night,

363
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,840
都有点冻僵了
just sort of frozen in place.

364
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,310
可怜虫
The poor bastard...

365
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,680
别走
Don't move.

366
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,090
乔·麦克米伦
Joe MacMillan.

367
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,580
当然
Of course.

368
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,720
黛安·古德
Diane Gould.

369
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,520
我们从未正式见过面  真是有趣
Funny that we've never officially met.

370
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,560
但我可是知道你
But I'm certainly aware of you.

371
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,760
阿马多·古德·吉尔森  我欣赏你们的商业模式
Amador Gould Gilson. I admire your business model.

372
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,960
精简的技术投资组合
Small, intelligent investment portfolio.

373
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,170
可以称之为精品店
I guess you could call that boutique.

374
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,720
规模不是一切  对吧
Well, size isn't everything, right?

375
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,990
我听说你帮穆特尼收购了跳蚤市场
I hear you facilitated the SwapMeet acquisition at Mutiny.

376
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,360
恭喜
Congrats.

377
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,140
我们对此很激动
We're very excited about it.

378
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,200
我很惊讶卡梅伦·豪伊能愿意
I'm surprised Cameron Howe wanted to play ball

379
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,500
跟其他公司共事
with another company.

380
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,410
她肯定心情很好
She must be in a good place.

381
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,420
打扰了  我能...
Excuse me. Can I, um--

382
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,140
-跟你说句话吗  -当然
- can I borrow you for a sec? - Yeah.

383
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,350
很高兴终于认识你了
It's great to finally meet you.

384
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,690
我也是
Mm, you as well.

385
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,790
我上哪去弄个那玩意
How do I get one of these?

386
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,350
赚更多钱
Make more money.

387
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,950
这就要说到我们的小问题了
Which brings us to our little problem.

388
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,850
你听过这个人吗  托弗·埃里克森
You heard of this individual, Topher Erickson?

389
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,070
没印象
Does not ring a bell.

390
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,670
他爸爸是卡尔·埃里克森
His father's Cal Erickson,

391
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,820
通用原子的高级副总
senior vice president of General Atomics.

392
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,790
好吧
Okay.

393
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,630
他好像参加过你的一个派对
Well, apparently he was at one of your parties

394
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,370
在派对上摄入了大量可卡因
and indulged in a copious amount of cocaine.

395
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,650
然后开着他爸给他的18岁生日礼物
And then grabbed someone and went off on a little joyride

396
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,860
一辆全新的法拉利带人去兜风
in the brand-new Ferrari his father procured for his 18th birthday.

397
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,240
哪个混蛋会花六万块买意大利车
What kind of jerk spends 60 grand and buys Italian?

398
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,810
可这个混蛋
Yeah, well, this particular jerk

399
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,300
是你四分之一的收入
funds about a quarter of your business.

400
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,450
好吧
Okay.

401
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,080
而你需要这种无聊的客户
And it's boring old contractor clients like that

402
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,710
来支持你的软件实验
that float your little software experiments.

403
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,770
我去找人聊聊
I'm gonna mingle.

404
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,150
安排一下  我会大事化小
Set something up. I'll do damage control.

405
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,270
很好
Good.

406
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,330
你好
Hi there.

407
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,730
真"友好"
Friendly fella.

408
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,550
不是所有人都有你那南方人的热情
Well, we can't all have your Southern charm.

409
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,610
感谢你在我孙子出生时打来问候
I want to thank you for calling me when my grandson was born.

410
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,030
是你打的吧
That was you, right?

411
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,800
是啊  神秘的乔·麦克米伦
Oh, sure. Joe MacMillan, man of mystery.

412
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,680
能与老朋友叙叙旧真好
Yeah, it's always good to hear from an old... friend.

413
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,260
你也挺会交新朋友的
Well, you seem to be doing just fine making new friends.

414
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,190
古德女士只是个生意伙伴
Oh, Miss Gould is just a business associate.

415
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,980
不  我是说这里所有人
Oh, no, I mean everyone here.

416
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,730
他们都很喜欢你
They're lapping you up.

417
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,260
拿德州范儿做文章是个好主意
It's a good call, playing up the Texas thing.

418
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,530
大家就喜欢看表演
People love a performance.

419
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,880
你也挺会演的啊
It looks like you're in a performance of your own, huh?

420
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,710
更像是独角戏
More of a one-man show kind of thing.

421
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,640
是的  我就是独角戏大师
Yeah, I'm a regular Spalding Gray.

422
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,750
我还要去招呼人
I left someone hanging.

423
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,320
保重
Be well.

424
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,290
太好了  你还在这儿
Oh, good, you're still here.

425
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,440
我还担心你被老朋友乔·麦克米伦绑架了呢
I was worried you got kidnapped by that old pal Joe MacMillan.

426
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,460
-要续杯吗  -好的  谢谢
- Can I top you off? - Yes, please.

427
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,890
你今晚轰动全场啊
You certainly made a splash tonight.

428
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,820
怎么说
How so?

429
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,930
你是派对的焦点
You're the life of the party.

430
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,890
大家都喜欢你
Everybody loves you.

431
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,140
这话只跟你说  我告诉唐娜
Between you and me, I told Donna

432
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,850
我是为公事邀你来
I was inviting you for business.

433
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,120
但其实  我就是不想一个人来
But really, I just didn't feel like flying solo,

434
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,050
尤其在这种情况下
you know, under the circumstances?

435
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,980
很高兴能帮忙
Glad I could be of service.

436
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,400
多疯狂啊
Isn't that crazy?

437
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,290
你跟一个人建立了一段生活  一起养孩子
That you can build a life with someone, raise kids,

438
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:55,790
从二十多一直到四十过半都在一起
spend your 20s, your 30s, half your damn 40s together,

439
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,230
最终却毫无感觉了
and in the end feel nothing?

440
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,130
怎么可能啊
How is that possible?

441
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,700
我不知道
I don't know.

442
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,380
要抽根烟吗
Would you like a cigarette?

443
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,450
不了
No.

444
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,280
不用
No, I'm good.

445
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,400
我不知怎么失去了对香烟的胃口
Somewhere along the line, I lost my taste for tobacco.

446
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,130
还有香槟酒
And champagne.

447
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,620
派对
Parties.

448
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,840
我跟律师说  我不想飞过来
I told my lawyer I didn't want to fly up here

449
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,270
马上保托弗出去
and bail Topher out right away.

450
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,830
让他冷静一下吧
Let him cool his heels for a while,

451
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,500
好好想想自己的行为
reflect upon his actions.

452
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,250
再说  我也不太喜欢旧金山
Plus, SF's not my cup of tea.

453
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,170
离开拉荷亚肯定很不舍
It must be hard to leave La Jolla.

454
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,760
我喜欢德尔马  完美混合了
I love Del Mar. It's got the perfect mix of

455
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,320
沙岸浪区和一片片的礁石
sand bottom beach breaks and patchy reefs.

456
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,220
很容易找到合适自己的浪
It's, uh-- it's very easy to find a wave you can call your own.

457
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,720
我一向羡慕冲浪的
I've always envied surfers.

458
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,140
我们在科罗纳多岛跟海军合作
We do a little naval work out at Coronado Island.

459
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,500
那些海上的家伙
Those bastards offshore

460
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,410
好像什么都不在乎
look like they don't have a care in the world

461
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,010
我却困在办公室里担心包交换
while I'm stuck to my seat worrying about packet switching

462
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,060
和电脑病毒  真是的
and computer viruses, thank you very much.

463
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,820
包交换
Packet switching?

464
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,610
-国防部的吗  -嗯  没什么意思
- Is that with the DoD? - Yeah, nothing sexy.

465
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,890
就是搬运一堆电子箱子
Just moving a bunch of electronic boxes around.

466
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,050
系统慢得要死
System's so damn clunky,

467
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,150
他们打算全部重做
they're gonna overhaul the whole thing.

468
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,260
一听就是麻烦
Ugh, sounds like a pain in the ass.

469
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,640
知道你该怎么办吗
You know what you should do?

470
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,560
你该学学那些什么都不在乎的家伙
You should take a page from those carefree bastards

471
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,600
去冲个浪  换换脑子
and you should catch a wave, huh? Clear your mind.

472
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,730
乔能给你介绍个好教练
Joe's got a great instructor down your way.

473
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,380
她可棒了
She's, uh-- she's amazing.

474
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,790
知道吗  她叫
And guess what, her name--

475
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,720
莎蒂
it's, uh-- her name is Sandy.

476
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,050
-莎蒂  -是吧  乔
- Sandy. - Right, Joe.

477
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:36,460
好啊  很想见见她
That's good. Love to meet her.

478
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,990
我知道你们是想哄我
Look, I know I'm being managed here.

479
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,220
这酒的味道不错  但也冲不走
Glenfiddich goes down nice, but it doesn't wipe away

480
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,250
警察那通电话给我的难受
the taste of that phone call from those cops.

481
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:50,110
托弗还是个孩子  我们不让孩子胡闹
Topher's still a teenager. We don't let our boy run wild.

482
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,020
卡尔  我听说
Cal, I was very troubled

483
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,910
你儿子的事后十分不安
when I heard what happened to your son.

484
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:57,100
我完全不知道我家里有未成年人
I had no idea there were minors in my home

485
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,260
和毒品
or narcotics,

486
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,260
我绝不会赞成那种事的
and in no universe would I approve of that.

487
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,900
好吧
All right.

488
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,370
你人似乎不错
You seem like a decent man.

489
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,670
不像弗里斯科的疯子
Not some 'Frisco nutjob.

490
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,320
我会向我家领导  就是我那口子好好交待
I'll submit a detailed report to the big boss, I.E., my wife,

491
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,380
应该就没事了
and, uh, that should clear things up.

492
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,290
不过最好别跟她提莎蒂
Might not mention Sandy to her, though.

493
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,140
穿潜水衣的姑娘最美了  是吧
Nothing like a girl in a wet suit, am I right?

494
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,250
可不是  但我更喜欢比基尼
You sure are. Although, I prefer a bikini.

495
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,270
嗯
Yeah.

496
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,600
旧金山的一些生意伙伴
Some of our business associates in SF,

497
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,780
挺滑稽的  懂吗
they're a little funny, if you catch my drift.

498
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,640
握手无力
Soft handshakes.

499
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,740
或许我们走运
Hell, maybe we'll get lucky

500
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,690
那些死基佬会染上那种特别的流感
and all the faggots will catch that special flu that's going around.

501
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,370
只要我儿子不染上就行
As long as my son stays away from it.

502
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,960
反正有的是时间管教他
But, uh, got plenty of time to whip him into shape.

503
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,440
我说了  他还小
Like I said, he's still a kid.

504
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,820
好了  先生们  差不多了
All right, gentlemen, it's that time.

505
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,800
好的  先生
All right. Yes, sir.

506
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:54,680
小心点
Hey, watch it, man.

507
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,500
我觉得你不用担心你儿子
Do you know, I wouldn't worry about your son.

508
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,320
等他远离了你  就会找到自己的道路
He'll find his path when he gets away from you.

509
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,230
但我替你老婆难过
But I feel sorry for your wife.

510
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,420
她不得不躺在那里忍受你
She has to lie there taking it,

511
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,260
心里想着  自己是造了什么孽
wondering what the hell she did

512
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,680
要闻你嘴里的恶臭
to have your stinking breath in her face.

513
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,600
等等  或许我错了
Or, wait, maybe I was wrong.

514
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,920
或许闻你口臭的不是你家领导
Maybe the big boss isn't the one taking it.

515
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:16,930
老天啊  乔
Jesus Christ, Joe.

516
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,350
那孙子都被我们搞定了  你非得...
We had the son of a bitch locked and you had to--

517
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,410
非得怎么
Had to what?

518
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,030
我们是向政府卖安全软件的
We sell security software to the government.

519
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,050
等等  别这样
Wait. Come on,

520
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,270
昨晚跟你聊天很开心
It was great hanging out with you last night.

521
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,900
-我能...  -嗯
- Can I just-- - Uh, yeah.

522
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,200
好啊
Sure.

523
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,440
好
Cool.

524
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,550
你继续工作吧
I'll let you get back to work.

525
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,070
听说你俩昨晚好好谈了谈
I heard you two had a good conversation last night.

526
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,420
是啊
Uh, yeah.

527
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:34,280
我决定保留跳蚤市场原有的代码
I decided to, uh, keep the SwapMeet code as it is

528
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,050
将部分穆特尼代码转为C++好连接界面
and translate some of Mutiny into C++ to bridge the interface.

529
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,440
真的  那太好了
Really? That's great.

530
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,000
他们会激动坏的
The guys are gonna be thrilled.

531
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,730
而且  我觉得我们该解雇他们
And I think we should fire them.

532
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,480
什么  为什么
What? Why?

533
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,170
你有合理的理由可以跟黛安交待吗
Do you have an actual, you know, reason we can give Diane,

534
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,000
因为她得为此买单
since she's the one who's gonna have to pay for it?

535
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,750
有
Yes.

536
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,400
我们不需要他们
We don't need them.

537
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,540
今晚吃饭
Well, the dinner is tonight.

538
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,760
如果你真想解雇他们
If you really want to fire the guys,

539
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,860
你自己跟黛安说去吧
then you can tell Diane yourself.

540
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,900
不  他们有三人玩的《雪人山任务》
Oh, no! They have three-player "Yeti Mountain Mission"?

541
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:11,590
比一场
Race!

542
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,740
不不  别玩电玩
No, no, no, no, no. No video games.

543
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,380
我们是来团建的
We're here to coalesce as a group.

544
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,980

00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,230
你站最后
So you're gonna be at the end.

549
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,440
你站那边最后
You're at this end over here.

550
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:28,830
-头发也算高度吗  -是的
- Hey, does hair count? - Yes, hair counts.

551
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,270

Wonderboy, down at the end.

554
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,350
快点  各位
Come on, guys.

555
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,060
好了  神童
Yeah, Wonderboy.

556
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,970
好了  盟军司令部命令你们
All right, you've been ordered by Allied Command

557
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,910
选12名普通军事犯
to select 12 general prisoners...

558
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,570
-我是无辜的  -他们被军事法庭判刑
- I'm innocent. - ...convicted by courts-martial

559
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:48,320
即将被判死刑  或服很长的刑期
and sentenced to be executed or serve lengthy prison terms

560

563
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,180
你要带他们深入敌后
And you will deliver them behind enemy lines

564
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,590
进入法国  执行破坏任务
in France to undertake a mission of sabotage

565
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,170
该任务或许能改变战争结果
that could change the course of the war.

566
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,080
好吧  李·马文
Okay, Lee Marvin,

567
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,050
可那部电影里大部分人最后不是死了吗
but don't most of the guys in that movie eat it?

568
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,060
最后非常惨
By the end, is it more like the "Dirty Deuce"?

569
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,520
我叫你知道什么叫惨  博迪
I'll show you a Dirty Deuce, Bodie.

570
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,680
这是隐喻
It's a metaphor.

571
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,600
其实  应该叫寓言
Actually, it's more of an allegory.

572
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,790
别那么激动  蓝妹妹
Uh, pipe down, Smurfette.

573
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,260
寓言就是一种隐喻
An allegory is a metaphor.

574
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,360
去你妹  精子
F you, semen.

575
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,500
精子  她喊我精子吗
Semen? Did she just call me semen?

576
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,210
下场战役开始了
It's time for the next battle!

577
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,780
天呐
God.

578
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,570
各位玩家  跟我来熟悉一下
Players, follow me for instruction

579
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,970
公平比赛的规则
in the rules of honorable play.

580
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,430
你得小点声
You need to turn down your toys.

581
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:35,000
走吧  各位  展现一下你们的本事
Come on, guys. Let's see a little bit of that Apache know-how.

582
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,750
掩护我  掩护我
Cover me, cover me!

583
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,840
他在那儿
There he is, there he is!

584
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,770
-小心  大块头  -该死
- Buckle up, big man. - Shit!

585
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,070
各位  别傻站着  反击啊
Guys, don't just stand around. Fight back!

586
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,870
-我没子弹了  我完了  -去你的
- I'm out, I'm done. - Screw you, asshole.

587
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,310
绿队  集合
Green team, gather round, gather round.

588
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,550
好了  集中精神
All right, look, focus, okay?

589
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,000
守住基地  互相掩护
Guard the base. Get each other's backs, all right?

590
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:05,870
这东西好使吗
Is this thing even on?

591
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,930
博迪  趴下  你要被打中的
Bodie, get down. You're in the line of fire!

592
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,690
神童  别吃了
Wonderboy, get that out of your mouth.

593
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,350
拜托  专心点
Come on, man, get your head in the game.

594
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,260
各位  看啊
Hey, guys, check it out.

595
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,260
如果把这玩意遮住  就不会被打中了
If you just cover this thing, you can't get hit.

596
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,400
肯定有办法解除整个系统
There must be a way to disengage the entire system.

597
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,800
你们一群娘炮
What a bunch of pussies.

598
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,990
这是性别歧视
That's sexist.

599
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,810
-他是你队友  -去你妈  死屌
- He's on our team! - F off, you big D.

600
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,420
天呐  停下
Oh, my God, stop!

601
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,550
我们都要死了
We're all gonna die!

602
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,310
审判日到了  各位罪人
It's Judgment Day, sinners!

603
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,710
躲过一击
Dodged a shot.

604
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:38,220
{\an9}BGM: Goodnight, Saigon

605
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,440
我们上吧
Let's do this!

606
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,020
好诶
Yeah!

607
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,740
先生  先生  你被取消资格了
Sir! Sir! You are officially disqualified.

608
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,000
什么
What?!

609
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,440
绿队  绿队  绿队
Green! Green! Green!

610
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,140
我们绝对相信
We feel 100% confident.

611
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,430
只要任务指派明确
If we're properly assigned,

612
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,550
我们三周就能完成
we can get this whole thing out the door in three weeks.

613
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,040
三周
Three weeks?

614
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,880
这比我们想的要快得多  是吧
That's much sooner than we expected, right?

615
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,560
我真希望...
Oh, I just wish--

616
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,860
算了  她不会来了
Let it go. She's not coming.

617
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,090
我以为你俩都谈好了
I thought you two had a good conversation.

618
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,700
是啊  我也以为
Yeah, I thought so, too.

619
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,690
我们非常尊敬卡梅
We have so much respect for Cam

620
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,340
和你们共同建立的一切
and what you guys have built together.

621
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,330
听上去很好
It sounds nice and all,

622
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,330
但关键问题是  你们能和她配合吗
but the real question is can you work with her?

623
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,820
-绝对的  -当然了
- Definitely. - Of course.

624
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,220
我们是觉得她没法跟我们配合
We just get the feeling she can't work with us.

625
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,680
知道吗
You know?

626
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,520
可以点餐了吗
Are we ready to go ahead and order?

627
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,610
对不起
I'm sorry.

628
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:48,880
不怪你
It's not your fault.

629
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,800
买单
Can we have the check, please?

630
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:54,890
我觉得如果卡梅不想跟他们合作
I just think if Cam doesn't want to work with the guys,

631
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,940
她该有勇气当面处理
she should have the courage to deal with it face-to-face.

632
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,880
我知道
No, I know.

633
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,990
我是想让她跟你说的
Look, I wanted her to tell you,

634
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,710
但既然她没来
but since she's not here...

635
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,600
卡梅想解雇道格和克雷格
Cam wants to fire Doug and Craig.

636
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,580
是吗  这是大事
Really? That's big.

637
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,400
是啊
Yeah.

638
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,380
你也同意吗
Do you agree with her?

639
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,100
她是我的合伙人
Well, I-- she's my partner.

640
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,860
我个人觉得他们是很好的人才
Personally, I think these guys are a big asset.

641
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:23,080
但你和卡梅伦的关系才是最重要的
But your relationship with Cameron is the most important thing.

642
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,790
那才是我的投资对象
That's what I'm investing in.

643
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,090
如果无法跟道格和克雷格合作下去
If working with Doug and Craig is untenable,

644
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,130
穆特尼可以提前付清他们的钱  让他们走人
Mutiny can pay their earn-out early and send 'em home.

645
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,820
但你才说他们是重要人才
But you just said that they're a big asset.

646
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,390
我当然不会乐意
I wouldn't be happy about it,

647
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,790
但强扭的瓜不甜
but it's better than forcing something toxic.

648
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,960
我只是希望问题是真出在他们身上
I just hope it's the guys who are the problem.

649
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,020
团建得怎么样了
So, how's the team-building coming?

650
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,330
还挺有成效
Well, surprisingly productive.

651
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,080
但由于我争议性的军事策略
Although I've been banned from future competition

652
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,970
被禁止再来参赛了
due to my controversial military tactics.

653
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,080
你可以过去  他们还在呢
You can get out there. They're still there.

654
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,390
挺好玩的
It's stupid fun.

655
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,190
不了  我过来是因为
No, I just came by 'cause I--

656
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,490
我说过会来
well, 'cause I said I would.

657
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,380
瞧瞧你  好和气先生
Well, look at you, Mr. Nice Guy.

658
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,630
好和气先生
Mr. Nice Guy?

659
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,710
当年在卡迪夫  你是销售部高级副总裁
Back at Cardiff, you were the heavy SVP of Sales.

660
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,520
那些上百万的客户
All those multimillion-dollar accounts,

661
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,300
大家都怕死你了
everybody was scared shitless of you.

662
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,140
我也是
You know, including myself.

663
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,590
但现在
But now...

664
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:22,840
现在怎么了
Now what?

665
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:28,420
我就是说  做老板听上去很不错
Look, I just mean, you know, being the boss sounds good,

666
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,750
但这样更好
but this is better.

667
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,740
不用负多少责  乐趣无穷
There's minimal responsibility, maximum fun.

668
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:37,150
对了  你总跟大家讲的那个故事是什么来着
Which reminds me, what's that story you keep telling the guys?

669
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,830
-那个什么...  -那个没意思了
- Something about... - That thing's outta gas.

670
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,850
博斯
Bos!

671
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,490
-你真该看到的  -你绝不会相信的
- You should've seen it. - Oh, man, you're not gonna believe it.

672
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,940
戈登像神风队队员一样
Gordon went full-on kamikaze.

673
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,850
他差点把那人干死
He practically murdered the guy.

674
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,180
起初感觉挺没劲
It seemed totally lame at first,

675
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,300
不过还真挺有意思的
but it was actually pretty awesome.

676
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,160
是啊  她都喜欢
Yeah, even she liked it.

677
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,490
你下轮该跟我们一起玩
You should play the next round, man.

678
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,850
-你肯定打得好  -不了
- You would shred this course. - No.

679
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,140
来嘛
Come on. Come on.

680
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,510
博斯  博斯
Bos! Bos! Bos!

681
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,780
不了
No, I'm good.

682
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,080
真不了
I said I'm good!

683
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,560
再去玩一轮吧
Go have another round.

684
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,010
去吧  你们那么喜欢
Get on in there. You guys enjoy it.

685
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,430
好吧
Okay, yeah.

686
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,470
卡梅
Cam.

687
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,830
几点了
What time is it?

688
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,820
很晚了  你没去吃晚饭
It's late. You missed the dinner.

689
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,610
天呐  唐娜  真抱歉
Oh, my God, Donna, I'm sorry.

690
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,410
天呐  我不知道...
Jesus, I-- I don't know...

691
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,240
我想去的  我打算去的
I meant to be there. I planned to be there.

692
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,220
我不知道是怎么了
I don't know what happened.

693
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,070
你工作太辛苦了  就是这样
You're overworked, that's what happened.

694
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,200
你累坏了
You're exhausted.

695
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,440
晚饭吃得怎么样
Um, how was the dinner?

696
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,090
挺好
Fine.

697
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,850
道格挺能忍的
Doug sucked up a lot.

698
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,450
天呐  我烦死那人了
God, I hate that guy.

699
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,230
我知道  但克雷格还好
I know. But Craig's okay.

700
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,650
是啊
Yeah.

701
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,600
他们走后
After they left,

702
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,130
我跟黛安说了你想解雇他们
I told Diane you want to fire them.

703
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:33,960
怎么样
And?

704
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,900
她说不行
She said no.

705
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,970
什么意思  她说不行
What do you mean, she said no?

706
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,680
他们是协议的一部分
They're a part of the deal.

707
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,360
他们是重要人才
They're an important asset

708
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,670
我们只能想办法跟他们合作
and we have to find a way to make it work.

709
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,560
什么
What?

710
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,340
她不是我们这边的吗
I thought she was on our side.

711
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,730
她觉得这样对公司更好
She feels it's what's best for the company.

712
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,410
好吧
Okay.

713
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,780
好吧  多谢你去问  我很感激
Okay, well, thank you for asking. I really appreciate it.

714
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,190
嗯
Yeah.

715
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,210
-回家见  -嗯
- I'll see you at home. - Yeah.

716
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,060
有人吗
Hello?

717
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:58,140
我不介意晚上工作  但你的电话有点吓到我了
I'm cool to work at night, but your call kind of freaked me out.

718
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,170
我们今天失去了通用原子
We lost General Atomics today.

719
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,950
他们是我们37%的年收入
They represent 37% of our annual billing.

720
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,520
怎么回事
What happened?

721
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,750
我拿他们换了更有价值的东西
I traded them for something more valuable.

722
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,260
这是什么
What's this?

723
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,830
阿帕网的登录凭证
The log-in credentials for the ARPANET,

724
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,400
那是国防部的包交换网络
the Department of Defense packet-switching network.

725
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,180
我通过通用原子得到的信息
I secured the information through General Atomics.

726
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,080
赶在我的登录凭证失效前
I want you to look into it before they flag

727
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,870
你好好看看
that my credentials still work.

728
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:28,120
好  但阿帕网不是新东西
Okay, but, you know, the ARPANET isn't new tech.

729
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,460
挺旧的了  又不是导弹代码
It's sort of rusty. It's not like missile codes.

730
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,560
或消防飞机图纸
Or fire plane blueprints.

731
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,480
这没什么意思
This is-- this is mundane stuff.

732
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,980
我知道  是古董了
I do know that. It's antiquated.

733
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,620
所以它需要升级
And that means it's ripe for an upgrade.

734
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,390
我该做什么
So what should I do?

735
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,810
你进去  看个明白
I need you to go into it, map it,

736
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:50,500
帮我想出接下来该怎么做
and help me figure out what's next.

737
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,400
为什么
Why?

738
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,080
-先玩这个  -有两个控制器
- Play after this. - There's two controllers, though.

739
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,620
等我玩完前十的
Play after I finish the best out of 10.

740
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,980
你是个《打鸭子》白痴天才啊
Man, you're like some kind of "Duck Hunt" Savant.

741
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,330
难道我在其他方面就不行吗
Does that mean I'm totally deficient in other areas?

742
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:26,060
《打鸭子》天才  但不会团队合作
Like "Duck Hunt" Savant, but bad team player.

743
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,310
拜托
Come on.

744
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:30,570
跟那俩...
So how's it going with...

745
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,970
混蛋和二货处得咋样了
...Dick und Doof?

746
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,530
混蛋和二货
Dick und Doof?

747
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,900
我的德裔祖父就这么喊劳莱和哈代[喜剧组合]
That's what my German grandfather called Laurel and Hardy.

748
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,990
意思大概是"胖子和笨蛋"
Loosely translates to "Chubby and Dumb."

749
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:43,130
贴切  道格是混蛋
Well, that's perfect, 'cause Doug's the Dick...

750
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,910
克雷格是个二货
Und Craig ist Doof.

751
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,300
-是啊  -是啊
- Ja. - Ja.

752
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:52,920
无所谓了
Oh, whatever, though.

753
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,280
看来我只能想办法合作了
I guess I'm gonna have to make it work.

754
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,620
你现在成了和事老
All right, hope you haven't lost your edge

755
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,090
希望水平没下去
now that you're a peacemaker.

756
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,700
要汽水吗
Uh, oh, do you want a soda?

757
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:08,180
-好啊  -嗯
- Yeah, sure. - Yeah?

758
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,020
老天
Jesus!

759
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,670
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

760
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,750
我想跟你说件事
You know, I wanted to tell you something.

761
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:30,280
我在想  你想留多久都行
I've been thinking, and you should stay here as long as you want.

762
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,220
找房子不急的
You can take your time finding a place.

763
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,160
谢谢  太棒了
Oh, thanks. Yes!

764
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,990
好了  给你了
All right, all you.

765
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,040
能问你个问题吗
Can I ask you a question?

766
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,270
你什么时候知道自己要失去卡迪夫的
When did you know you were losing Cardiff?

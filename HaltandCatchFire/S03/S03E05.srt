00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,510
等等  真的有个叫《手刃异客》的游戏
Wait, wait, there's seriously a game called "Xenophobe"?

49
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,720
对  是砍外星人  不是指排外
Yeah, but you're just being intolerant to aliens, so it's cool.

50
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,870
好了各位  关于交换确认的
All right, guys, any updates on the bug

51
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,200
那个错误我们处理得怎么样了
we've been having with the swap confirmations?

52
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,210
已经彻底排除了  一切顺利
Overhauled and working great.

53
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,300
好了  "核灾小子"正式上黑名单了
That's it, ChernobylBoy is going to the stocks.

54
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,490
-国庆快乐你个混蛋  -好
- Happy Fourth of July, asswipe. - Yeah.

55
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,980
有个菜鸟用户交易了
Some fifth grader reneged

56
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,340
一个《第三类接触》午餐盒然后又反悔了
on a swap for a "Close Encounters" lunch pail.

57
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,240
多次违反交易规则的用户会被取消交易特权
We're revoking trading privileges for repeat offenders.

58
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,190
目前还只是内部测试
It's all internal for now,

59
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,920
但我们正打算加上这一段
but we're working on putting this into here.

60
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,320
让他见识下断头台
Show him the guillotine.

61
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,210
酷  但这意味着你被全网封禁了吗
Awesome but are you dead in Mutiny?

62
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,950
这算是注销用户吗
I mean, are we cancelling people's subscriptions?

63
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,280
就是让你的角色没有脑袋满街走
You just wander around without a head

64
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,350
让大家看见了都知道
and that lets people know

65
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,420
这个无头男是个混蛋
this guy without a head is a total dick.

66
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,770
千万别跟这个混蛋交换
Don't swap with this headless dickwad.

67
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,030
能做个脖子喷血的效果吗
Can we get some blood spurting out of the neck hole?

68
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,050
-我们怎么没想到呢  -快做进去
- God, how did we not think of that? - Put that in, dude! Yes.

69
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,660
好了  我们还要解决区域外交易流程中的
All right, we got to solve for the Sev 1 cache miss bug

70
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,080
一级缓存丢失错误
in the out-of-region swap routine?

71
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,730
今天测试  明天就好
Tests today, ships tomorrow.

72
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,660
-你确定  -戈登  放心吧
- You sure? - Gordo, relax.

73
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,910
跳蚤市场运行良好  唯一没预料到的是
SwapMeet's righteous. The only thing that's sideways

74
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,220
总有人无视"不得买卖"的规则
is people keep ignoring the no buying stuff rule.

75
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,510
好多人都在拿票子买卖
A lot of people are trading for DBs.

76
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,350
-票子  -就是现金
- DBs? - Dollar bills.

77
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,640
技术上我们可以监控每一笔交易
We could technically monitor every trade

78
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,140
完全禁止这种事
to make sure it doesn't happen.

79
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,180
那我可没辙了  这种事可轮不着我拍板
I can't help you there. That's way above my pay grade.

80
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,290
有人拿现金买东西
So people are buying shit for money.

81
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,610
那又怎样  我们早就想到了
So what? We knew this would happen.

82
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,450
太麻烦了  用户想要一种便捷的购买方式
It's clunky. Our users want an easy way to buy things

83
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,340
但是办不到  所以他们很失望
and they're frustrated it doesn't exist.

84
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,220
用户还想让警察乐队复合呢
Our users want the Police to get back together,

85
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,340
可惜人家主唱没兴趣
but Sting's not interested.

86
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,580
道格和克雷格说他们可以利用周末
Doug and Craig said they can spend the weekend

87
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,050
整合他们的代码开通信用卡交易
integrating their code for credit card transactions.

88
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,600
不行
No.

89
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,080
我们收购时他们已进入测试阶段
They were already in beta with it when we acquired them.

90
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,680
基本上可以启用了
It's basically ready to go.

91
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,260
因为他们是从市面上直接拿的
Because they yanked it off the shelf.

92
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,780
那就是信用卡公司提供的示范代码
It's boilerplate code supplied by the credit card company.

93
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,180
他们稍做了美化而已
They just gave it a little shine job.

94
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,460
我们不需要完美的解决方案
We don't need the perfect solution.

95
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,050
要是现在先用上
If we have to temp something in now

96
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,660
以后再自定义也行
and customize it later, fine.

97
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,710
贴创口贴总要好过流血身亡吧
A Band-Aid is better than bleeding to death.

98
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,820
流血身亡
Bleeding to death?

99
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,350
唐娜  跳蚤市场上线后
Donna, SwapMeet has doubled in size

100
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,920
每周规模都会扩大一倍
every week since we went live.

101
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,420
你只是怕速度放缓而已
You're just scared of slowing down.

102
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,660
我不希望增长变慢
I don't want to slow our growth.

103
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,840
而你表现得好像接受信用卡
And you keep acting like accepting credit cards

104
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,140
是一桩魔鬼的交易
is some devil's bargain.

105
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,130
关键在于信用卡使用方便
They make people's lives easier. That's the whole point.

106
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,400
好吧  穆特尼是一座城堡
Okay, Mutiny is a castle.

107
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,830
你和我建好之后分了一点给黛安
You and I built it and then we gave a little piece to Diane.

108
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,750
然后又分了一点给该死的道格和克雷格
And then a little piece to freakin' Doug and Craig.

109
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,370
可是跟信用卡公司做交易
But making deals with credit card companies

110
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,250
就是放下护城河的吊桥
is just lowering the drawbridge.

111
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,990
一个老百姓都没有的王国要城堡有什么用
What good is a castle if nobody's in the kingdom?

112
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,170
别忘了每周规模扩大一倍啊
It doubles in size every week, okay?

113
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,700
肯定有别的解决方案  我保证
There is a fix for this, I promise.

114
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,670
我只是暂时还没有想出来
I just-- I don't know what it is yet.

115
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,950
卡梅  你在下面吗
Hey, Cam, are you down there?

116
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,830
是啊  博斯
Yeah, Bos.

117
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,750
卡梅  我明天早上六点整来接你  好吗
Cam, I'm gonna pick you up tomorrow at 6:00 a.m. sharp, all right?

118
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,990
得早点到机场
We got to get to the terminal a little bit early.

119
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,910
每次他们都为我尾椎骨里的金属棒难为我
They always give me shit about the rods in my tailbone.

120
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,020
好
Okay.

121
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,410
我们搬来时就知道
When we moved here, we knew that

122
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,660
有些情况必须迅速适应
there'd be times that we'd have to adapt quickly.

123
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,060
眼下就是这种情况
This is one of those times.

124
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,130
唐娜  就只有我们  好吧
Donna, we're all alone, okay?

125
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,680
没有别的公司哪怕在尝试做
There's no other company that's even attempting to do

126
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,840
跳蚤市场在做的事
what SwapMeet is doing.

127
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,910
我不想猛地栽进去  一下子把事情搞砸
I don't want to rush in and just screw it up all at once.

128
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,420
能等我周一回来再谈吗
Can we talk about it when I get back Monday?

129
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,170
-什么也不会搞砸  -周一再说
- We're not gonna screw anything-- - Monday.

130
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,130
一路顺风
Have a nice trip.

131
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,840
斯坦福就在墨菲特联邦机场旁边
Stanford's over here right next to Moffett.

132
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,520
再过去是国安重镇
Over here is jackboot central.

133
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,160
国防部  北美联合防空司令部和国安局
DoD, NORAD, the NSA.

134
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,320
我打印了网络上
And I printed out all the directories

135
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,770
所有主机的地址名录
for every mainframe on the network.

136
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,600
我们可以利用我发现的一些弱接入点
And we can leverage some of the weak access points I found.

137
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,950
五角大楼基本上无懈可击
Now, the Pentagon is nearly impenetrable,

138
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,070
但是别的一些地方
but some of these other guys--

139
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,670
犹他州简直就是个筛子
Utah is a total sieve.

140
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,980
这儿是什么
What is this right here?

141
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,960
那不属于阿帕网
That's not really part of ARPANET.

142
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,460
是国家科学基金会
That's just the new network

143
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,040
刚推出的新网络
the National Science Foundation just rolled out.

144
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,250
对  国家科学基金网
Yeah, NSFNET.

145
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,710
史蒂夫·沃尔夫的作品
Steve Wolff's baby.

146
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,950
我通过康奈尔的节点连进去了
I went in through Cornell's node.

147
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,490
它只上线了几天
It's only been live for a couple days.

148
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,380
你能别那样吗
Could you-- could you not do that?

149
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,200
国家科学基金网的传输线
NSFNET's transmission lines

150
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,160
理论上比阿帕网快十倍
are 10 times faster than ARPANET theoretically.

151
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,590
但总是崩溃
But it keeps crashing.

152
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,560
不到一个小时
I've been bumped off

153
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,670
-我就掉线了六次  -还有呢
- six times in less than an hour. - What else?

154
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,870
说真的  乔  那只是一堆拿铁饭碗的蠢蛋
Seriously, Joe, it's just a bunch of tenure-track slapdicks.

155
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,930
他们甚至搞不定基础结构
They can't even get their basic infrastructure right.

156
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,670
他们拿国家网络的补助
They got grants for the national network,

157
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,500
丢一堆钱给地方
threw a bunch of cash at the local level,

158
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,830
让区域网络高不成低不就
and left the regional networks in the middle hanging.

159
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,910
-所以呢  -所以肯定会遭遇瓶颈
- So? - So there's a huge bottleneck baked in.

160
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,260
没空间留给增加的需求
There's no room for increased demand.

161
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,010
-所以像阿帕网  -商用被禁止了
- So like ARPANET-- - Commercial use is banned.

162
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,990
这儿或许有戏可作
There could be something here.

163
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,340
这就是个麻烦
It's a lemon.

164
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,810
我已经研究这个六周了  我知道
I've been working on it for six weeks, I know.

165
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,330
你知道
Well, you know.

166
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,870
你已经研究六周了
You've been working on it for six weeks.

167
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,170
通用原子给我们的资产负债表留下三百万的缺
General Atomics left a hole in our balance sheet $3 million deep.

168
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,200
我们的钱在大量流失  阿帕网就快要被关闭了
We're hemorrhaging money. ARPANET will be mothballed soon.

169
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,020
国家科学基金网就是未来
And NSFNET is the future.

170
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,830
这就是你刚刚告诉我的
That's the story you just told me.

171
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,860
不  乔  听着
No, Joe. Listen--

172
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,440
再继续深挖
Just dig deeper on this.

173
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,920
迁就我吧
Indulge me.

174
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,920
今天就这样了
That's all for today.

175
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,430
睡一觉  莱恩  你脑筋开始不清醒了
Get some sleep, Ryan. You're starting to miss things.

176
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,320
-你来这儿干吗  -我需要跟你谈谈
- What are you doing here? - I need to talk to you.

177
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,390
-不是时候  -就现在
- It's not a good time. - Now.

178
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,410
今天谢谢你了
Thank you for today.

179
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,390
去看这小家伙真让我兴奋
I'm just so excited to see this little monkey,

180
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,320
路过烧烤店都没停
I whizzed right past Sonny Bryan's.

181
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,970
宝宝什么时候开始说话
Hey, when do babies start talking?

182
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,720
三四个月大的时候吧
Um, three or four months?

183
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,000
他说的第一个词会是烧烤
His first words are gonna be barbecue

184
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,910
我会确保的
if I got anything to say about it.

185
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,200
看看这个
Oh, hey, check this out.

186
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,230
记得那个空乘吗  那个有美腿的
Remember that stewardess, the one with the legs?

187
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,070
她给了我这个送萨姆
She gave me that for Sam.

188
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,000
詹姆斯还小的时候  每次我出门旅行
Every time I'd go on a trip when James was young,

189
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,960
我就会弄一个给他  钉在他的泰迪熊上
I'd get one of these, pin it to his teddy bear

190
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,250
这样早上他一睁眼就知道我回家了
first thing in the morning so he'd know I was home.

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,450
真是太暖心了  博斯
That's really sweet, Bos.

192
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,300
你怎么计划的  你要把车运回去
So what's the plan? You gonna ship the bike

193
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,190
还是一路开回去
or are you gonna ride off into the sunset,

194
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,710
在回湾区的路上兜一牙的虫子
catch bugs in your teeth on the way back to the Bay?

195
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,010
我都不知道它还能不能骑
You know, I don't even know if it runs.

196
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,390
我想走一步看一步
I'm kind of playing this all by ear.

197
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,700
他们知道你回来了吧
Well, they know you're back, don't they?

198
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,860
不
No.

199
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,760
我不会让我妈有时间准备怎么跟我废话
I'm not gonna give my mom time to work up some stupid speech.

200
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,400
你会庆幸自己来了的
You'll be glad you did this.

201
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,310
你现在挺好  卡梅
You're doing all right, Cam.

202
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,540
真抱歉  我以为琳达不打算离开了
I am so sorry. I thought Linda would never leave.

203
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,560
她该一大早就来接孩子的
She was supposed to pick up the kids first thing in the morning.

204
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,510
对她来说  这就是一大早了
For her, this is first thing.

205
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,580
她告诉我  学校有个猥琐的爸爸
She was telling me about this creepy dad at school

206
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,320
一直叫她一起去卡皮托拉滑滑板
that keeps asking her to go boogie boarding in Capitola.

207
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,160
我觉得她是希望我嫉妒
I think she wants me to be jealous.

208
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,250
我可不喝那玩意装的水
Oh, I am not drinking out of that.

209
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,900
看看这个
Hey, look at this.

210
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,650
记得我们国庆日
Remember that bar we went to

211
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,960
去洋葱谷的路上去的那家酒吧吗
in Independence on our way to Onion Valley?

212
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,900
酒保把我们灌得烂醉  最后不得不睡车里
The bartender got us so drunk, we had to sleep in the car.

213
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,220
没错
Oh, yeah.

214
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,930
丙烷罐放哪了
Hey, where are the propane canisters?

215
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,800
我忘了
I forgot.

216
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,930
但我们可以路上去后院达人买
But we can go stop by Orchard Supply on the way out.

217
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,550
那里独立日不开门
Orchard Supply is not open on the Fourth.

218
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,370
这破玩意根本不能用
You know, and this stupid thing is useless.

219
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,310
我不介意在野外幕天席地
Hey, I don't mind sleeping out under the stars.

220
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,510
响尾蛇就指望你那么做呢
Yeah, that's what the rattlesnakes want you to do.

221
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,660
去还有什么意义
You know, what's the point of even going?

222
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,240
什么都是坏的
You know, nothing's working.

223
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,190
孩子们不在家
Well, the kids are gone

224
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,930
自我们来了加州后
and we haven't had one night alone

225
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,690
就没单独在家度过一个晚上
since we got to California.

226
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,060
我们可以  在家度假
We could always, you know, have a vacation at home.

227
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,590
这样吧
You know what?

228
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,510
我们不去了
We're staying here.

229
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,480
-真的吗  -真的
- Yeah? - Yeah.

230
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,830
我去把牛排解冻
I'm gonna defrost the porterhouses.

231
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,600
你可以把我复活节
You can pull out that lacy thing

232
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,660
买给你的那件肩带蕾丝的衣服找出来
with the straps that I got you for Easter.

233
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,940
我去换运动裤
I am changing into sweatpants.

234
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,750
或是运动裤
Or sweatpants.

235
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,430
看看  我们的发型一样  看到了吗
Look at this. We got the same hair. You see?

236
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,480
你想抱抱他吗
You want to hold him?

237
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,760
不  不了  博斯
No, no, Bos.

238
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,400
-我的出租车就到了  -抱着宝宝
- No, my taxi's coming. - Hold the baby.

239
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,530
抱着宝宝  卡梅伦 
Hold the baby, Cameron.

240
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,950
好了
Yeah.

241
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,660
你确定你不能留下来吗  卡梅伦
Are you sure we can't convince you to stay, Cameron?

242
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,770
婴儿床安然到达了
I see the crib got here in one piece.

243
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,740
是啊  其实还是一堆零件
Uh, yeah, in a lot of pieces, actually.

244
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,210
我打算这周末装好
Gonna put it together this weekend.

245
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,150
摇篮已经不够萨姆睡了
Sam's graduating out of his bassinet.

246
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,430
这么快  早熟的小家伙  
Already? Precocious little fella.

247
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,380
看看他  我差点忘了
Look at him. Oh, I almost forgot.

248
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,300
记得我以前会给你这个吗
Do you remember when I used to get these for you?

249
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,050
当然记得
Yeah, sure do.

250
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,720
我的车来了  好了
Oh, that's me. Okay.

251
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,490
好  明天一大早见

恭喜  你们的宝宝真的很酷
Congratulations. Your baby's really cool.

253
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,180
我也得走了
I got to get going, too.

254
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,300
真不敢相信他们让你国庆节这天上班
I can't believe they're making you work on the Fourth.

255
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,610
总得赚钱养家  工作就是工作
Yeah, well, mouths to feed. Work's work.

256
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,120
我知道那种工作
Oh, I know that kind of work.

257
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,970
我很快就回来
I'll be back soon.

258
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,310
-得去报个到  -好
- Just got to kiss the ring. - All right.

259
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,280

Do you want to talk to Grampy? Come talk to Grampy.

260
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,120
今天是国庆节
It's, uh-- it's the Fourth of July.

261
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,540
嗯  你没说今天放假  所以...
Right. I mean, you didn't say I had the day off, so...

262
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,420
莱恩  今天是国庆节
Ryan, it's the Fourth of July.

263
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,160
你要我走吗
So, do you want me to leave?

264
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,270
不
No.

265
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,450
不  进来吧
No, come on in.

266
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,370
要咖啡吗
Coffee?

267
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,930
好
Sure.

268
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,780
关上电脑
Kill the computer.

269
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,460
你喝咖啡什么都不加  对吧
You take it black, right?

270
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,110
加奶油  还有很多糖
Cream, lots of sugar, actually.

271
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,230
喂  是我
Oh, hi, it's me.

272
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,130
我来达拉斯了
I'm here in Dallas.

273
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,820
是啊  我住在汽车旅馆
Yeah, I'm staying at the Motel 6 on...

274
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,800
具体地址我也说不清
I actually don't know where.

275
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
附近有迈达斯酒店和沃特伯格汉堡
There's a Midas and a Whataburger.

276
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,180
但是  好吧
But, uh, okay.

277
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,790
我就在这儿
I'm here.

278
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,630
好了  牛排马上就好
All right, steaks will be ready in a few.

279
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,540
我的天
God.

280
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,260
太不真实了
Unreal.

281
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,020
你听见了吗
Do you hear that?

282
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,730
没有
No.

283
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,970
没错
Exactly.

284
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,710
没有发出仓鼠死叫的调制解调器
No modems screeching like a dying hamster.

285
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,630
她可真固执
God, she can be so stubborn.

286
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,750
谁会想到  平时那么随意的人
And, you know, you wouldn't think somebody so punk

287
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,260
对生意上的事会那么保守
would be so conservative when it comes to business.

288
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,550
是啊  我其实指的就是调制解调器
Yeah, I was really just talking about the modem.

289
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,900
当然  我懂  让人压力很大
But, sure, I get it. It's stressful.

290
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,260
但卡梅伦在大多事上都很有帮助
But Cameron's been great for the most part.

291
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,900
孩子们很喜欢她
You know, the kids love her.

292
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,890
不过  这可能好坏参半
Of course, I guess that's a mixed bag.

293
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,430
她对你也很有帮助  对吗
I mean, she makes you better, right?

294
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,080
告诉你  我真的不想谈论工作
You know what? I really don't want to talk about work.

295
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,470
我没谈论工作
I wasn't talking about work.

296
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:11,120
好吧  我真的不想谈论卡梅伦
Oh, well, I really don't want to talk about Cameron.

297
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,780
那么你想谈点什么呢
Well, what do you want to talk about?

298
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,020
我根本不想说话
I don't really want to talk at all.

299
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,670
然后我们收购了家公司  真叫人抓狂
And then we acquired this company, which was insane

300
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,680
因为一夜之间要发的工资涨了一倍
because our payroll doubled, like, overnight.

301
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,810
倒也没事  因为人们都说
Which is fine because that's what people say

302
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,430
要提高在硅谷的竞争力就得这么做
you have to do to be competitive in Silicon Valley,

303
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,870
所以我们就这么做了
so that's what we did.

304
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,340
对了  我们收购的那家公司
Uh, but, yeah, so the thing that we acquired,

305
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,930
名叫跳蚤市场  是个刚起步的公司
it's called SwapMeet and it started off--

306
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,150
我知道跳蚤市场
I know about SwapMeet.

307
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,010
不可能不知道  因为我还是用户
It's pretty hard to miss 'cause I'm still a subscriber.

308
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,900
-好吧  -是啊
- Yeah. - Yeah.

309
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:01,700
我差点就买了一台《飞天蜈蚣》街机
I actually almost pulled the trigger on a swap for this "Centipede" cabinet,

310
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,480
但从温尼伯运过来太麻烦
but the shipping from Winnipeg was ridiculous.

311
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,760
再给你们加满吧
Can I refill for y'all?

312
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,420
我不用  你看你
I'm-- I'm okay, but if you...

313
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,630
买单吧
Just the check.

314
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,340
很抱歉我没联系过你
Hey, I'm really sorry that I didn't reach out.

315
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,330
我想写信的  但是
I wanted to write, but I'm--

316
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,020
我不是很善言语
I'm not very good with words

317
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,170
除了程序语言以外
unless it's, like, part of a chunk of code.

318
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,100
老实说  我不确定你希不希望我打给你
And honestly, I wasn't sure if you wanted to hear from me.

319
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,810
我很高兴你打给我
It was good to get your call.

320
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,860
我不是专程来看你的
I mean, I didn't come just to see you.

321
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,100
我是去我妈那儿拿点东西
I came to grab some stuff from my mom.

322
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:50,610
你要见她啊  那很好  不是吗
Well, you're gonna see her. That's-- that's great, right?

323
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,220
她和伦恩要搬走了
Yeah, I mean, she and Len are moving,

324
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:56,180
我要去拿件东西
so just got to get what I came here for

325
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,020
然后就撤
and then get the hell out.

326
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,100
我不知道  她
I don't know, she just--

327
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,730
其实我并不想见她  但是
if I had my way, I wouldn't have to see her at all, but...

328
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,610
见到你我真的很高兴
I'm really happy to see you.

329
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,800
别这样  得了吧
Don't. Come on.

330
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,100
你...
I mean, you--

331
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,470
给  要不你来买单
here, why don't you get this

332
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,320
然后卖掉那张你根本没用的机票来抵钱
and start working off that plane ticket that you never used.

333
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,320
开玩笑的  只是个玩笑
I'm kidding. It's just a joke.

334
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,300
我来买单  就三美元的出差经费
I'll get it. It's like a $3 business expense.

335
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,820
我能报销的  没事
I can write it off. It's fine.

336
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,040
好吧
Yeah, okay.

337
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,910
谢谢
Thanks.

338
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,390
新的还没完成他们就过节去了
They quit for the holiday before they finished the new one.

339
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,730
你怎么看
But what do you think?

340
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,100
什么会取代我的广告
What's replacing me?

341
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,310
义齿霜
Denture cream.

342
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,180
彩票
The lottery.

343
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,260
这座城市啊
This city.

344
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,830
我无法确定这里究竟是美丽还是恐怖
I can't decide if it's beautiful or horrifying.

345
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,450
我妈来过这儿
My mom came out here.

346
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,200
又死在这儿
She died here.

347
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,520
什么都在这儿待不长
Nothing lasts in this place.

348
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,540
这座城市在建成初期
The whole city burned down seven times

349
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,010
被烧毁了七次
in the first couple years of its existence.

350
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,520
就连名字也改过
Even its name has been reinvented.

351
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,560
你知道旧金山以前叫什么吗
You know what San Francisco used to be called?

352
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,570
知道  耶尔巴布埃纳
Yeah, Yerba Buena.

353
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,170
这正是这座城市的了不起之处
Look, that's what makes this city so great.

354
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,440
你可以搞砸  你可以失败
You can screw up, you can fail,

355
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,580
那又如何
and so what?

356
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,100
你还有下一次机会
You get another chance.

357
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,000
-有你没你无所谓  -多让人兴奋啊
- It's disposable. - It's exciting.

358
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,550
因为你永远不知道接下来会发生什么
'Cause you never know what the hell's next.

359
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,150
义齿霜
Denture cream.

360
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,570
我不知道我还有没有下一次机会
I'm not sure I've got another next in me.

361
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,680
你得知道这一点
You should know that.

362
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,130
天啊  我好多年没听过这首歌了
Oh, my God. I haven't heard this song in years.

363
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,140
刚刚那火辣的一炮足够把吃的牛排消化掉了吧
Was that totally hot sex worth burning the steaks or what?

364
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,080
好啊  绝对足够了
Oh, God, a billion times yes.

365
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,050
-干杯  -敬这辈子最好的假期
- Cheers. - To the best vacation ever.

366
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,060
我爱你
I love you.

367
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,570
我也爱你
I love, too.

368
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,820
科学小知识  香蕉皮擦皮鞋效果最好
True fact-- a banana peel will shine your shoes like no other.

369
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,360
年轻的时候可给我省钱了
Saved me a mint in my 20s.

370
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,970
我好像在哪里读到过
Yeah, I think I've read that somewhere.

371
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,680
是吗  他回来了
Oh, you did, huh? Oh, there he is.

372
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,480
我给你
I got a little--

373
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,150
带了点烤肋条和玉米饼
got ribs and hoecake for you.

374
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,950
给你
Um, yeah.

375
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,250
对了  还有
And, oh, there's some--

376
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,160
外边放的烟花
you know, there's some fireworks going on out there

377
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
有些还真挺好看的
that are pretty incredible.

378
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,020
他在育儿室里
He's in the nursery.

379
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,610
你爸把婴儿床组装好了  他帮了不少忙
Your dad built the crib. He's been a huge help.

380
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,470
甚至出门买了趟尿布
Even went out for some diapers.

381
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,210
不  我本打算组装婴儿床的
No, no, no. I was gonna build that crib.

382
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,000
再过几小时萨姆就该醒了
Sam will be up in a couple hours.

383
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,260
我赶紧补觉去了
I'm going to bed.

384
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,860
我看咱们都赶紧休息去吧
Well, I think we could all use some sleep.

385
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,580
是啊  好啊  居家好父亲
Yeah. Yeah, okay, Mr. Family Man.

386
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,940
你不在家没人怪你的  詹姆斯
Nobody's blaming you for being gone, James.

387
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,940
也许我该带几个飞行胸章回来  是不是
Well, maybe I should have brought home some pilot wings, huh?

388
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,390
是不是就能弥补了
Maybe that would make up for it.

389
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,520
你小时候很喜欢那些胸章的
You loved those when you were a kid.

390
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,620
你攒了一大盒子呢
Hell, you had a whole box of them.

391
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,680
我攒了一大盒子是因为妈妈是个空姐
Yeah, I had a whole box of them because Mom was a stewardess.

392
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,740
我只是把你给我的往盒子里一扔了事
I just tossed the ones you gave me on top.

393
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,680
你可以篡改过去哄你那个小姑娘老板
You can rewrite history to impress your 15-year-old boss,

394
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,120
但你骗不了我
but you don't fool me.

395
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,410
我们以前去南湾吃的那家餐厅
Hey, what's that place we used to go eat at

396
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,970
叫什么来着
down in the South Bay?

397
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,580
洛斯加托斯餐厅
Oh, Los Gatos Cafe.

398
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,690
-对了  -那儿的火腿蛋松饼太好吃了
- Yeah. - Those eggs Benedict.

399
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,880
我明天带你去那儿吃早午餐
I'm taking you there tomorrow for brunch.

400
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,960
回归麻烦现实前最后再爽一次
One last hurrah before the crazies return.

401
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,130
我们现在的确食欲大开
Well, we definitely worked up an appetite.

402
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,130
天啊  一天两次
God, twice in one day.

403
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,250
我们应该经常这么做
We should do that more often.

404
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,590
一周两次都超过平均水平了
Twice in one week is above average.

405
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,510
杰拉尔德·福特当总统后
We have not had sex

406
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,250
我们就没有一天做过两次了
twice in one day since Gerald Ford was in the office.

407
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,850
-才不是  -就是这样
- No, that's not true. - It's totally true.

408
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,700
生孩子之前  你算算时间线
Pre-kid. Do the math. Carry the one.

409
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,110
是福特时代
Ford.

410
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,610
天啊  我们太需要做爱了
Oh, my God. We really needed this.

411
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,880
幸好没去露营
I'm so glad we didn't go camping.

412
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,800
-真的吗  -是啊
- Really? - Yeah.

413
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,950
很高兴听你这么说
I'm so glad to hear you say that.

414
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,460
是吧
Yeah?

415
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,850
我们没以前那么年轻了
I mean, we're not as young as we used to be.

416
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,190
是啊
Yeah.

417
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:37,620
但哪怕是年轻时  在树后解手
But, you know, even then popping a squat behind a tree

418
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,160
第二天醒来后的背疼
and your back kills when you wake up.

419
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,530
还是不要了
No, thank you.

420
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,290
是啊  但...
Yeah, but...

421
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,200
你很喜欢去塔玛佩斯山玩的
you loved all those times at Mt. Tam.

422
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,370
什么
What?

423
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,700
约塞米蒂多棒啊
Yosemite was freaking awesome.

424
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,790
知道吗
You know what it is?

425
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:00,260
这就像疯狂的定义
It's like that saying about what crazy is.

426
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,200
你重复做一件事很多遍
That you do the same thing a ton of times

427
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,840
然后说"这事一直很糟"
and you're like, "This always sucks."

428
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,520
太疯狂了
That's insanity.

429
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,400
一直重复做同样的事
It's doing the same thing over and over

430
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,910
期望会有不同的结果
and expecting a different result.

431
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,040
没错  露营就是疯狂
Yeah. Yes. Camping is insanity.

432
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:24,190
天啊  我累死了
Oh, God. I am exhausted.

433
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,720
剩下的你要是不吃了
Hell, if you're not gonna eat the rest of the thing,

434
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,680
那就给我
then I want it.

435
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,270
你知道在旧金山湾
You know how hard it is

436
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,240
找到不错的玉米煎饼有多难吗
to get a halfway decent breakfast burrito in the Bay Area?

437
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,090
根本没戏  谢谢
It's a fool's errand. Thank you.

438
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,080
真有趣  我没想到你是在这样的地方长大
It's funny. It's not where I pictured you growing up.

439
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,360
我不是
I didn't.

440
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,420
不是吗
No?

441
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,270
那家伙回来了
Oh, that hombre's back.

442
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,540
他带了现金
He brought cash with him.

443
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,340
你要不要做你来做的事了
You gonna do what you came here for or what?

444
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,790
别说话
Shh, don't.

445
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,420
卡梅伦  我知道头两千英里很容易
Cameron, I know the first 2,000 miles are easy

446
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,710
难在那最后20英尺上
and the last 20 feet are hard,

447
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,110
但你都大老远来了  我们都到了
but you've come all this way and now here we are.

448
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,480
好吧
Okay.

449
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,020
你为自己也该这么做
You owe this to yourself.

450
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,910
也为了他们
And to them.

451
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,420
快点
Come--

452
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,940
他要买走你爸的车了  卡梅伦
he's buying your dad's bike, Cameron.

453
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,540
好啊  别说了
Fine. Just stop talking, okay?

454
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,660
那是你的  快去买下
That's yours. Go get it. Go get it.

455
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,160
行了 你干什么呢
Stop it! What the hell are you doing?

456
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,290
人们犯错从不是因为他们不爱你  卡梅伦
People don't make mistakes because they don't love you, Cameron.

457
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,620
而是因为他们爱你
They make mistakes because they do.

458
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,190
就算你说出来  这也太扯了
Oh, that is such a crock of shit even from you.

459
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,830
你又要我替你收拾烂摊子吗
You want me to pick up the slack for you again?

460
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,260
好啊  今天当然不会有什么不同
Great, why should today be any different, huh?

461
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,140
你够了
Would you stop?

462
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,430
卡梅伦  你不是专程为了车来的
Cameron, you didn't come here just for the bike.

463
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,210
-得了  -老天爷
- Come on, now. - Jesus Christ!

464
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,130
听着  你或许以为自己是我父亲  但你不是
Listen, you might think you're my father, but you're not, okay?

465
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,170
我知道  该死
I know that, God damn it.

466
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,900
不不  我觉得你不知道
No, no, I don't think you do.

467
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,580
我想早点开始今天
Thought I'd get a jump-start on the day.

468
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,350
好啊
Great.

469
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,640
去洛斯加托斯餐厅啊

470
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,200
我特别想吃那个火腿蛋松饼
I'm really jonesing for that eggs Benedict.

471
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,800
嗯
Yeah.

472
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,370
算了  孩子就要回来了
I don't know. The kids will be home soon.

473
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,000
改日吧
Rain check?

474
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,960
一切都好吗
Everything all right?

475
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,450
嗯

I'm gonna go work on the ham if it's all the same.

478
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,360
好好玩一会儿
You know, get some good ham time in.

479
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,870
-好啊  -嗯
- Oh, sure. - Yeah.

480
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,580
如果你想吃  冰箱里还有剩披萨
There's some leftover pizza in the fridge if you want some.

481
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,700
老板有消息吗

482
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,330
她还回来吗  都要中午了
She even coming in? It's already noon.

483

我又不负责看着她  唐娜

Okay, I don't know exactly what we're looking at here,

534
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:09,390
但这群傻蛋让位给别人了
but the slapdicks have given way to the big swinging variety

535
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,780

Interesting, yeah,

539
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,560
但还是补不上你担心的那个资金缺口
but it doesn't do much to fill the money hole you're so worried about.

540
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,030
天呐  你干得真棒

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,540
但现在有太多人抱怨
but we're fielding too many complaints

554
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:28,110
我们不支持现金业务
about the lack of support for our monetary transactions.

555
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:32,540
所以今晚  我们将上线信用卡代码
So tonight we will go live with the credit card code

556
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,580
道格和克雷格已经对此进行了一周的测试
that Doug and Craig have been testing all week.

557
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,200
用户进行购买时
When users purchase something,

558
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,370
我们会收取物件本身的售价再加一小笔交易费
we charge them for the item and we add a small transaction fee.

559
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,930
将售价数额的支票寄给卖家
Mail checks to sellers for the sales price--

560
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:04,580
这是干什么呢
What's this?

561
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,030
首先  欢迎回来
Well, first of all, welcome back.

562
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:11,570
我想我可以代表大家说一句  很高兴你平安
I think I speak for all of us when I say I'm glad you're okay.

563
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,090
我一直在工作
I've been working.

564
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:14,920
我们都在工作
We've all been working.

565
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:16,990
我看出来了
I can see that.

566
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:22,730
我有交易的解决方案了
I have a solve for transactions.

567
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:26,690
我们这一周都在进行信用卡界面的内测
We've been in beta on a credit card interface all week.

568
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,760
道格和克雷格的代码吗
Doug and Craig's code?

569
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,300
是的  它很好用
Yeah, it works great.

570
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,320
好吧  那你就没征求我意见决定了
Okay, so you just went ahead and did that without me.

571
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,660
各位能出去一下吗
Could you all excuse us?

572
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,410
我和卡梅伦要单独谈谈
Cameron and I need the room, please.

573
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:51,300
看看我是不是看懂了
Hey, so let me see if I've got this.

574
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,890
比如说  我想买个...
So let's say I want to buy a,

575
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:58,480
花一百块买初版《超人》漫画
I don't know, first Superman comic for $100.

576
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:02,880
穆特尼从我运通卡收费  再加五块
Mutiny charges my AmEx, adds five bucks.

577
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,510
作为交易费
As a transaction fee.

578
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,990
但运通卡会另收三块钱作交易费
But AmEx takes three of those dollars as their transaction fee,

579
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,610
所以穆特尼只挣两块
so Mutiny is only making two bucks.

580
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,380
让我生气的是  昨天
Meanwhile, I'm really pissed because yesterday

581
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:14,120
我本可拿一百块换本《超人》漫画
I could have shelled out 100 DBs for that Superman

582
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,850
但今天  我要白白花掉五块
and today I'm shelling out an extra five bucks for nothing.

583
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,730
并不是白费  我们提供的是有价值的服务
It's not nothing. We're providing a valuable service.

584
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,760
真像个中间商
Oh, spoken like a true middleman.

585
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,730
好吧  那你想怎么解决
Okay, so what's your solution?

586
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,260
路径号码
Routing numbers.

587
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,690
银行就是用这个转钱
It's how banks move money.

588
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,360
用户用支票支付
And our subscribers pay by checks,

589
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,070
他们的账号本就记录在案
so their account numbers are already on file.

590
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,400
好吧  你卖我《超人》
Okay, you sell me Superman.

591
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,830
穆特尼直接从我的银行提钱
Mutiny pulls funds directly from my bank

592
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,490
将其存入你的账户
and deposits them into your account

593
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,870
用我们自己的路径号码为途径
using our own ABA routing number as a pipeline.

594
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,790
这基本上是免费的
Oh, and it's basically free

595
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,910
因为这不产生交易费
because we don't incur a transaction fee

596
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,810
我们也不收交易费
and we don't charge one either

597
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,650
因为这样成本不会大幅提升
because our expenses haven't skyrocketed.

598
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,480
但如果按你的办法  我们就需要
But then with your way, we'd need, what,

599
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,620
三个人处理信用卡交易
three people handling credit card transactions,

600
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,550
再有几个人处理写支票  寄支票
a few people to handle check writing and mailing,

601
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,350
可能还得找一两个会计
probably an accountant or two.

602
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,440
总共是...
So that's, what...

603
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,610
再雇12个人吗
twelve new hires?

604
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,020
嗯  差不多
Yeah, that's about right.

605
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,080
好吧  我的办法只需要再雇一个
Okay, my way adds one person.

606
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,000
一个
One.

607
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,900
你真是难以置信
I can't believe you.

608
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,330
你也是
Right back at you.

609
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,930
我们说好等我回来再商量的
We agreed to discuss this when I got back.

610
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,170
我们说好周一商量的
We agreed to discuss this on Monday.

611
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,900
今天都周五了  你去哪了
It's Friday. Where have you been?

612
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,170
谁管呢  我这不来了
Who cares? I'm here now.

613
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,090
你凭什么不跟我
Since when do you make decisions

614
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,620
商量一下就为我的公司拿主意
for my company without consulting me?

615
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,330
该死  我想找你商量  但找不到你
God damn it, I tried to consult you and I couldn't find you.

616
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:35,720
天呐  这就是我一直在担心的事
Oh, my God, this is exactly what I've been worried about.

617
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,050
-什么  -每次有新的人走进门
- What? - Every new person that walks through that door,

618
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,640
穆特尼都会再被从我这儿切走一块
another piece of Mutiny gets cut away from me.

619
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,460
不不  唐娜  穆特尼不仅是我的工作
No, no, no, Donna. Mutiny isn't just my job,

620
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,650
它就是我
it's who I am.

621
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:47,970
它也是我
It's who I am, too.

622
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,840
我一周都睡不着
I couldn't sleep all week.

623
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:53,570
我大可无视我收件箱里成山的抱怨
I could ignore the mountain of complaints in my in-box,

624
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,880
但我太在乎了
but I care too much.

625
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,610
我想出了更好的解决办法
I came up with a better solution.

626
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,810
虽然你觉得自己要在这里的一切上
Just because you think you need to sprinkle your fairy dust

627
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:03,190
洒上自己的仙尘才满意
over everything around here before you feel satisfied

628
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,400
不代表那样就更好
doesn't mean it's better.

629
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,860
不  它就是更好
No, it is better.

630
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,970
天呐
Oh, God.

631
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:11,340
好吧  但重点不在这里
Okay, but that's not the point.

632
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,150
我们之前有麻烦
We were in real trouble.

633
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,990
我有麻烦时  我环顾四周
And when I'm in trouble and I look around,

634
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,720
得能看到你
I need to find you there.

635
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:22,010
我们得互相支持
We need to have each other's backs.

636
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:29,400
有时候我得躲起来  才能理清思路
Sometimes I need to crawl into a hole just find my head.

637
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,970
我知道你一直对我很耐心  哪怕我在拖后腿
I know you're patient with me even when I drag my feet.

638
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,850
我知道我该自己出去找地方住
I know I should find my own place to live

639
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,500
不再给你们添麻烦
and stop imposing on you guys.

640
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,270
我知道
And I know that--

641
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:46,040
我没去成的那次跟道格和克雷格的晚餐
that dinner with Doug and Craig that I missed

642
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,890
你大概觉得我们不该解雇他们
that you probably didn't think we should fire them,

643
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,510
但你还是替我在黛安面前说话了
but you went to bat for me anyways with Diane.

644
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,690
我知道
I know that.

645
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,510
我是跟汤姆在一起
I was with Tom, okay? That's where I was.

646
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,280
我还想呢
Yeah, I was wondering.

647
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,860
可你总归该打个电话
Still, you should have called.

648
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,800
他说你是我遇到的最好的事
He said that you're the best thing that ever happened to me.

649
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:16,780
这是真的
And it's true.

650
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,340
并不是因为是他这么说
And not 'cause he said it or anything, just--

651
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,780
你是我的锚
you anchor me.

652
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,710
那我们现在就像个银行了
So I guess we're like a bank now.

653
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,410
这挺酷嘛
That's pretty cool, huh?

654
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,960
就是路径号码
It's a routing number.

655
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,090
我们又不会免费送烤箱
We're not giving away free toasters or anything.

656
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,580
我会支持你的  唐娜
I do have your back, Donna.

657
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,650
我的表现方式很奇怪
I have a weird way of showing it,

658
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,360
但我发誓  真的
but I swear I do.

659
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,620
我也支持你
I have yours.

660
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,470
这是我们唯一的焦点
This and only this is what we focus on.

661
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,390
等等  我觉得这很酷
Okay, yeah, time-out. This is super cool to me,

662
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,080
但只关注国家科学基金网吗
but only NSFNET?

663
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,950
你刚刚扯掉的线  都是大金主
The yarn you just pulled, those are the deep pockets.

664
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:57,920
没错
Exactly.

665
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,520
这是处女地
It's virgin territory.

666
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,720
沃尔夫创造了一个瓶颈  是吧
Wolff created a bottleneck, right?

667
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,020
是啊  不支持区域网  他是个疯子
Yeah, no support for regional networks. The guy is insane.

668
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,870
他太天才了  他在发出一个信号
The guy is brilliant. He's sending a signal.

669
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,590
他就像我们的戈尔巴乔夫
He's like our Gorbachev.

670
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,050
知道开放政策什么意思吗
Do you know what Glasnost is?

671
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,110
不是伏特加就是卫星
I want to say either a vodka or a satellite.

672
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,320
沃尔夫知道  他的网络若想发展
Wolff knows that the only way his network will grow

673
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,520
就需要私人注资
is if private money gets in the game.

674
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,090
问题是  这现在是违法的
The problem is that's against the law for now.

675
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,980
-但是  -但或许有一日会合法起来
- But... - But maybe one day it won't be.

676
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,660
等法规改变  人们会鱼贯而入
And when the rules change, people are going to flood in.

677
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,840
普通人在家拿苹果电脑  阿米加上网
Average people at home on their Apple IIe and Amiga

678
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,430
这会让系统过载
and it's gonna overload the system.

679
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,030
那么谁来打破瓶颈呢
So who breaks the bottleneck?

680
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,670
我们要在这里
We are going to create

681
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:42,050
建立一个区域网
a regional network right there.

682
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,590
过去  就是一堆堡垒
The past-- the past is a bunch of fortresses

683
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,770
通通与世隔绝
all closed off from the rest of the world.

684
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,310
我们不用建更快的电脑
We don't have to build a faster computer

685
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:52,600
或想出下一代必杀应用软件
or dream up the next killer application.

686
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,450
那是你要在堡垒里做的
That's what you do in a fortress.

687
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:00,780
我们要铺设他们之间的道路
We are going to pave a road between them.

688
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,690
你要要求董事会往一个可能永远
And you're going to ask the board to go deeper in the hole

689
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,470
不会挣钱的项目里投更多钱吗
on something that may never turn a dime?

690
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,370
我才不在乎董事会怎么想
I don't care what the board thinks anymore.

691
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,910
钱只是副作用
Money is just a side effect.

692
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,480
开放政策
Glasnost.

693
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,470
是开放的意思
It means openness.

694
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:15,090
跟开放作对永远是坏主意
And it's always a bad idea to bet against openness.

695
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,070
-你饿吗  -我不知道  乔
- Are you hungry? - I don't know, Joe.

696
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,320
你不知道自己饿不饿吗
You don't know if you're hungry?

697
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:22,190
我都不知道该怎么想了
I don't even know what to think anymore.

698
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,050
我想搞清你的思路
I try to decipher your sayings,

699
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,490
但电话一响  你就把我赶去别处了
but then the phone rings and you boot me to another zip code.

700
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,110
我们还没想出要怎么挣钱
And we still haven't figured out how to make any money

701
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,970
每天我回家都晕头转向
and I go home every day and I'm spinning

702
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,680
我都不知道你是不是喜欢我
and I don't even know if you like me.

703
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,500
我简直要疯了
I feel crazy.

704
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,430
你不是要疯了  莱恩
You're not going crazy, Ryan.

705
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,720
你是饿了
You're hungry.

706
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,390
我这周过得很不顺
Look, I've had a tough week.

707
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,390
能跟我一起吃晚餐吗
Will you join me for dinner?

708
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:49,860
好
Okay.

709
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,430
好  我跟你一起吃晚餐
Okay, I'll come to dinner with you.

710
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,040
挺好的
Sounds nice.

711
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,540
好好看看
Just take a good look.

712
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,070
这就是下一步
That's what's next.

713
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,600
黛安·古德
Diane Gould.

714
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,550
黛安  我是卡梅伦·豪伊
Diane, hi. It's Cameron Howe.

715
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:20,680
卡梅伦  怎么了
Cameron. What's going on?

716
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:23,340
我今天早些时候跟唐娜谈过
I had a talk with Donna earlier today

717
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,290
我想打电话
and I wanted to call

718
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:29,760
跟你说  我知道我最近有些古怪
and say I know I've been a little eccentric lately.

719
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,960
曾有人跟我说  古怪
Someone once told me that eccentric

720
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,820
不过是混蛋的花哨说法
is just a fancy word for asshole.

721
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,710
我也有点古怪
I'm a little eccentric myself.

722
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,880
而且这没办法
And you have to be

723
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,750
作为女人想在这行混出名堂就得这样
if you want to make it as a woman in this business.

724
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,860
路径号码的点子很棒
This routing number thing is really great.

725
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:46,950
好  我还想说
Yeah, okay, I also just wanted to call

726
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:50,360
谢谢你
and say thanks for, you know,

727
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,680
能看到穆特尼易物
seeing that Mutiny Exchange

728
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,140
是我们独力做不来的
wasn't something we could do on our own

729
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:57,110
收购跳蚤市场是明智之举
and that it was smart to buy SwapMeet.

730
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:00,160
是的  我的确不怎么喜欢道格和克雷格
And, yes, I don't love Doug and Craig,

731
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:02,850
但我完全尊重你
but I really totally respect

732
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,490
留下他们的决定
your decision to keep them at the company.

733
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,890
我跟唐娜说了
Like I told Donna,

734
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,950
我会愿意付钱赶走他们的  这是做生意的代价
I'd have paid for them to go away. Cost of doing business.

735
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,600
但你决定跟他们合作下去体现了你的坚强
But it shows strength that you decided to make it work.

736
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,570
多谢你打来  但是没这必要
Look, this call is appreciated, but it's unnecessary.

737
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,960
这是你的公司  你不用为自己的决定道歉
It's your company. You don't have to apologize for any decision.

738
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,630
最终  是由你决定
In the end, you decide.

739
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,550
卡梅伦
Cameron?

740
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:26,210
嗯  谢谢  黛安
Uh, yeah. Okay, thanks, Diane.

741
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,450
我得挂了  再见
I've got to go. Bye.

00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,330
小胖和瘦杆整天都没影
Haven't seen Mutt or Jeff all day.

143
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,220
两位女士都躲在各自的小窝里
And the ladies are in their respective foxholes

144
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,820
这似乎成了她们的习惯了
as seems to be their wont these days.

145
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,140
你有没有过想在这行里干一番大事
Do you ever try to be the bigger man in this business,

146
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,350
结果回报给你的只有几个烂果子的经历
but the universe just gives you a shit sandwich for your efforts?

147
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,940
那是当然有
Indeed I have.

148
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,580
但我要去看《图拉多》犒劳自己
But I'm treating myself to "Turan-dot," 

149
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,650
所以也没啥可抱怨的
so I can't complain.

150
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,750
-什么  -《图拉多》
- What? - "Turan-dot."

151
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,190
那部歌剧
The opera.

152
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,780
我要开拓自己的眼界
I'm broadening my horizons.

153
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,340
熟悉这地方
Know my new town.

154
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,010
那叫《图兰朵》吧
It's "Turandot."

155
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,370
抱歉几位  我接个电话晚了
Sorry, guys. I got stuck on a call.

156
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,660
好了  我们开始吧
Okay, let's get started.

157
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,070
要不要等等道格和克雷格
Uh, shouldn't we wait for Doug and Craig?

158
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,810
那就要白等了
That would be a waste of time.

159
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,930
-为什么  -我把他们开了
- Why? - I fired them.

160
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,640
什么时候
When?

161
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,690
就今早
This morning.

162
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,820
为什么啊
Why?

163
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,700
跳蚤市场已经完全整合好了
Well, SwapMeet's fully integrated

164
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,960
现金支付组件也没有错误了
and the cash feature's bug-free, 

165
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,390
所以不需要他们了
so I no longer need them.

166
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,240
那该给他们的预期盈利怎么办
And what are we going to do about their earn-out?

167
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,960
我觉得黛安的意思是希望我们好好合作
I feel like Diane was pretty clear she wanted us to make it work.

168
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,980
是吗
Was she?

169
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,270
当然  我
Yeah, I mean...

170
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,440
你怎么不
why would you--

171
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,980
我只是希望你先跟我们商量下
I just wish you'd discussed it with us first.

172
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,730
抱歉  黛安·古德来了  要见你们二位
Sorry, Diane Gould is here for both of you.

173
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,030
好啊  肯定是好事
Oh, should be fun.

174
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,220
我得承认我吃了一惊
Well, I must admit I'm surprised.

175
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,530
我以为你们已经协调好工作流程了
I thought you all had found a manageable workflow.

176
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,550
我们讨论了一下  然后决定
Well, we discussed it and we decided

177
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,000
道格和克雷格的作用已经充分发挥完了
that Doug and Craig's usefulness had run its course.

178
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,900
根据我们之前的讨论  我们都认为
And we both figured based on our earlier conversations

179
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,920
你会支持我们的决定
that you'd have our backs on this.

180
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,190
我之前说过  我会批准付款的
Well, as I've said, I'll authorize the earn-out

181
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,910
既然你们都决定了
if that's what you feel you need.

182
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,190
但我今天来不是说这个
But that's not what I'm here to discuss.

183
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,110
我有个消息
I have news.

184
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,870
有人向你们提出了收购邀约
You have an acquisition offer.

185
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,910
对方是计算机服务
From CompuServe.

186
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:40,940
计算机服务
CompuServe?

187
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,510
我知道  我也觉得不太合适
I know. I don't think it's a good fit either,

188
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,190
但给了一个底价
but it sets a floor.

189
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,590
多少
How much?

190
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,160
两千万
20 million.

191
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,900
那是之前西方集团报价的四倍
That's four times what Westgroup offered.

192
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,980
我们的成长真有那么迅速吗
I mean, have we really grown that fast?

193
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,810
事情是这样的  我也没想到
Here's the thing, and I didn't think

194
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,050
会这么快就跟你们谈这个
we'd be having this conversation so soon,

195
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,160
但我认为现在可以
but I think it's a good time 

196
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,520
考虑首次公开募股了
to consider the possibility of an IPO.

197
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,720
有大笔资金注入就可以做很多事
The things we could do with that influx of cash.

198
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,620
好吧  但这钱也不能随便花  对吧
Okay, it's not like we'd get to spend the money, though, right?

199
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,450
因为得建董事会  追求季度收益
I mean, we'd have to get a board and chase quarterly earnings.

200
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,940
那是当然  但也该想想其前景
Absolutely, but it's also important to consider the landscape.

201
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,140
看看甲骨文收购升阳
Look at Sun, Oracle.

202
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,450
想想微软筹到的钱
I mean, Jesus, the money that Microsoft has raised.

203
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,700
再说眼下穆特尼
Plus right now Mutiny is the 

204
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,630
是在线交易市场的巨头
dominant player in the online transaction market.

205
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,390
他们一听到这个报价
Once they hear the news of this offer,

206
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,230
都会跟风
there'll be imitators.

207
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,860
想想呀
I mean, just think,

208
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,750
我们一直想做的那些事
everything we've ever wanted to play with.

209
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,490
我们还可以组一个研发团队
We could hire a whole team for R&D.

210
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,860
行了  我才不会把公司剁成碎渣
Yeah, okay, I'm not chopping my company up into pieces

211
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,930
让你们去华尔街摇铃上市
so that you can ring a bell on Wall Street.

212
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,890
好了  这是件大事
Okay, this is just a lot.

213
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,560
我得花时间消化
I need time to process it.

214
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,740
当然  你去想吧
Sure, okay. You think about it.

215
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,130
慢慢想  爱想多久想多久
Take all the time you need.

216
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,530
这个决定很重大
This is a huge decision

217
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,040
你们俩都该好好考虑一番
and both of you should take a lot of time with it.

218
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,790
但不管你们怎么回事  都该处理一下
But whatever you have going on here, you need to deal with it.

219
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,900
这样吧  我在索诺马有套房子
I'll tell you what. I have a place up in Sonoma.

220
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,400
一个小葡萄园  环境安宁
It's a little vineyard. It's quite peaceful.

221
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,250
很适合整理思绪
It's a good place to get your thoughts in order.

222
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,740
要不你们周末去那儿吧
Why don't you guys go there, take the weekend,

223
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,110
达成一致
get on the same page?

224
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,860
乐意之至
We'd love to.

225
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,590
很好
Great.

226
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,790
周末我都有空
I'll be around all weekend

227
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,730
欢迎来找我谈
if you want to talk any of this through.

228
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,430
谢谢  黛安  非常感谢
Thanks, Diane. Really.

229
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,590
你想今晚还是明天开车去
So do you want to drive up tonight or tomorrow?

230
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,040
嗯  那个
Yeah, uh, well,

231
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,760
虽然跟你一起去葡萄园听上去十分浪漫
while a wine farm retreat with you sounds super romantic,

232
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,740
可我这周末很忙
I am busy this weekend.

233
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,120
现代社会建立在
Modern society sits on a foundation

234
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,930
如今被我们视为理所当然的服务上
of services we now take for granted.

235
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,040
铁路
Railroads.

236
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,330
高速公路
Highways.

237
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,720
水
Water.

238
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,680
能源
Power.

239
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,890
网络运算将会成为下一个重要的公共服务
Network computing will be the next great public utility.

240
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,760
我的工作已经让我们位居前沿
My actions have placed us at the vanguard

241
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,820
我们可以收获巨额回报
and we are poised to reap vast rewards.

242
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,010
美国早期的企业家们受时空所束缚
America's early entrepreneurs were bound by space and time.

243
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,080
而这个新网络将是无限的
This new network will be limitless.

244
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,380
那个  我问问清楚
Just-- I just-- just to be clear,

245
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,990
国家...
the N--

246
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,650
国家科学基金网是非营利的  对吧
The NSFNET is nonprofit, right?

247
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,350
只用于科研实验室  政府和大学
It's just for research labs and governments and colleges.

248
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,990
-没有商用  -对
- There is no commercial use? - That's correct.

249
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,880
-在第...  -22页
- On page-- - 22.

250
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,350
有泰勒-恩斯特战略公司的备忘录
There's a memo from Taylor and Ernst Strategies.

251
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,170
他们预计会有五年的立法过程
They anticipate a five-year legislative process.

252
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,280
我们已经在3090主机上花了六百万
And we've already spent six million on the 3090

253
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,540
在路由器和交换机上花了四十万
and another 400,000 on routers and switches.

254
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,120
等等  既然有这些速度和容量问题
Wait, with these speed and capacity issues,

255
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,980
为什么我们要投资买
why are we investing in faster equipment

256
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,570
比网络承受速度快的设备
than the network can bear?

257
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,030
现在只有56K  但是所有迹象
It's only 56K now, but all signs

258
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,650
都表明很快会升级到T1网线
point to a T1 upgrade coming soon.

259
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,540
各位  我理解你们的疑虑
Guys, I understand the skepticism.

260
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,310
无可否认这是一次大胆的期货赌博
There's no denying this is a bold futures bet,

261
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,050
但这是必然趋势
but it is a sure one.

262
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,700
可能会需要点时间  但是终会赚钱的
It may take some time, but the money will come.

263
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,340
先生们  不如我们这样
You know what, gentlemen? Why don't we do this?

264
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,060
不如我们趁这个周末
Why don't we take the weekend

265
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,130
消化一下这个惊人的提议
to digest this impressive proposal?

266
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,720
你们说呢  好吗
What do you say? Yeah?

267
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,260
很好  非常感谢
Good. Thank you very much.

268
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,330
谢谢
Thank you.

269
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,910
-谢谢  -不客气
- Thank you. - Pleasure.

270
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,430
-再见到你真好  -谢谢
- Great to see you again. - Thank you.

271
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,990
你欠我一局球
Hey, you owe me 18.

272
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,890
见到你真好  替我向贝基问好
Hey, good seeing you. Say hi to Becky for me, okay?

273
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,500
我喜欢这雄心  真的
I love the ambition. I do.

274
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,210
-我只需要你慢一点  -等待就会失败
- I just need you to slow down. - We wait, we lose.

275
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,540
我明白  真的  我也相信你的远见
I hear you, I do. And I believe in your vision.

276
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,820
所以我才在这儿  但是拜托  乔...
That's why I'm here, but please, Joe...

277
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,680

让他们同意
Just get them on board.

那才是你的作用
That's why you're here.

过程就是这样  知道吧
Well, this is the process, you know?

282

你该看看我告诉他们
You should have seen their faces

283
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,930
城堡要免费时  他们的表情

我们先看看孩子们回来前能过多少关
Let's just see how far we get before the girls get back.

316

320
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,430
那我今天就得到此为止了

他们刚批准的提议大半还是理论

我刚刚在洗澡

No, it's fine. I'm kind of supposed to ask

406
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,170
该问一下的
before I come up here anyway.

407

Well, souls don't come cheap.

416
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,900
你在水下关卡怎么这么厉害
I don't understand how you're so good at the underwater level.

417
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,680
天赋
It's a gift.

418
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,270
我其实并不在乎钱
You know, I don't even really care about the money.

419
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,740
我只想让他承认自己的所作所为
I just want him to admit what he did.

420
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,570
嗯
Yeah.

421
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,290
你可以的
All right, you can do this.

422
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,470
-好  -我相信你
- Okay. - I believe in you.

423
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,280
要是能朝乔扔火球...
Wish I could pelt Joe with fireball...

424
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,750
别
Don't.

425
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,410
终于啊
Yeah! Finally!

426
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,710
-过关了  -终于啊
- Victory! - Finally.

427
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,660
-想看个有趣的东西吗  -好啊
- You want to see something cool? - Yeah.

428
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,390
射频频谱像一把长尺
The radio spectrum's like a long measuring tape.

429
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,360
调幅控制低频
The AM band's the low frequency.

430
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,860
在底部
And it's down here on the bottom.

431
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,950
调频在顶端
And the FM is way up here on the top.

432
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,240
明白吗
You follow?

433
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,950
戈登  说实话
Man, Gordon, I got to be honest.

434
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,170
之前我不知道你在鼓捣什么
I didn't know what you were doing in here,

435
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,000
但这真是太酷了
but this is pretty rad.

436
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,530
你真这么想  其实挺傻的
You really think so? I mean, it's kind of silly.

437
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,960
不  我真心觉得很酷
No, no, I mean it. I think it's cool.

438
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,860
要是唐娜也这么想就好了
Yeah, well, I wish Donna shared your enthusiasm.

439
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,430
你要知道  你做了件很难得的事
You know, I hope you realize what a rare thing you've done.

440
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,630
你和唐娜
You and Donna.

441
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,510
你俩真的做出了一番事业
I mean, you guys built something real.

442
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,090
你也一样
Yeah, so did you.

443
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,330
拜托  不用这么客气
Oh, please. You don't have to do that.

444
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,420
我制造的机器无人会铭记
I built a couple of machines no one will remember

445
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,790
做的软件大家都以为是乔做的
and a piece of software everybody thinks is Joe's.

446
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,010
不说那个混蛋了
Enough about that jackass.

447
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,490
试试吧
Let's fire this thing up.

448
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:17,450
奇怪  昨晚还好好的
That's weird. I was just talking on it last night.

449
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,030
可能接触不良
Maybe there's a loose connection.

450
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,260
你确定吗
Oh, you sure about that?

451
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,650
来
Here.

452
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,520
启动吧
Fire it up.

453
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,100
CQ
CQ.

454
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,000
你好
Hey there.

455
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,940
能给我倒
Could I just get two fingers

456
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,710
两指威士忌吗
of something brown back there?

457
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,930
你听到了吗
Did-- did you hear?

458
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,420
我们能假装
Could we just pretend

459
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,760
你为我占了一个位置吗
that you were holding a place in line for me?

460
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,430
瞧瞧谁来了
Well, look who it is.

461
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,960
这位小姐要一杯金汤力
Uh, this young lady will have a gin and tonic

462
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,620
加一片酸橙  谢谢
with lime, please.

463
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:11,120
-你有伴吗  -没有  一个人
- Are you here with someone? - No, flying solo.

464
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,800
没办法  我和普契尼是老交情了
What can I say? Me and Puccini go way back.

465
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,340
你呢
You?

466
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,660
相亲
It's a blind date.

467
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,930
他是某个银行家的朋友的朋友
He's a friend of a friend of a banker or something.

468
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,540
我都忘了为什么会来这里
I forget how I ended up here.

469
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,320
很高兴认识你  多莉斯
I have enjoyed our time together, Doris.

470
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,250
谢谢
Gracias.

471
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,260
谢谢你救了我
Well, thank you for saving me.

472
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,260
你看上去可不像需要人救的女人啊
You don't strike me much like a woman needs saving.

473
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,760
听着
Hey, listen.

474
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,060
我来的时候经过了一家酒吧  看起来不错
There's a bar I pass on the way here. Looks like a good time.

475
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,790
演出结束后我们可以再去喝杯鸡尾酒
We can get another cocktail after the show.

476
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:54,500
给我两分钟  我们门外会和
Give me two minutes. I'll meet you outside.

477
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,660
敬我  多莉斯
Here's to me, Doris.

478
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,290
当然了  他完全不见踪影
But, of course, he is nowhere to be found.

479
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,820
紧急出口也紧锁  把我关在了外面
And, of course, the emergency exit locks behind me.

480
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,070
我一丝不挂  醉醺醺的
So I'm totally naked, super drunk

481
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,340
警报大作  他和我的外套
with this alarm blaring and he and my coat

482
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,600
在另一扇门里  但我完全不知道
are at a different door, but I didn't know that.

483
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,400
所以我一路跑回了寝室
So I ran all the way back to my dorm

484
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,840
像动画片里的间谍一样拿灌木丛遮身
ducking behind bushes like some cartoon spy.

485
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,400
幸好那是期末周  学校里没什么人
Thank God it was finals week and no one was around.

486
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,080
希望你跟他分手了
I hope you broke up with him.

487
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,660
事实上我嫁给了他
I married him, actually.

488
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,220
不会吧
Oh, no.

489
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,580
真不敢相信你真在阿·古·吉工作
I can't believe you actually work at AGG.

490
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,730
不  你妈妈是我公司的一名投资者
Oh, no, no, your mom's an investor in my company.

491
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,080
是一家叫穆特尼的在线服务公司
It's an online service called Mutiny.

492
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,640
少来  少来啦
Shut up. Shut up.

493
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,860
-你是穆特尼的老板  -半个老板
- You own Mutiny? - Yeah, a part of it.

494
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,730
等等  你是卡梅豪伊吗
Wait, are you CamHowe?

495
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,320
真是疯狂  我是预计先知
This is insane. I'm EstimatedProphet.

496
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,330
不  卡梅是我的合伙人
No, no, Cam is my partner.

497
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,670
它最棒了  我找一盘
It's like the best. I'd been looking for a tape

498
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:52,370
77年6月冰封大地演出的录像带好几年了
of this June '77 Winterland show for literally years.

499
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,590
注册穆特尼后  20分钟就找到了
Signed up on Mutiny, found it 20 minutes later.

500
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,920
太棒了
That's great.

501
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,500
唐娜  你和我妈该交朋友
So, Donna, you and my mom should be friends.

502
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,180
我们就是朋友
Oh, I think we are friends.

503
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,040
不  我是说  真朋友
No, yeah, I mean, friend friends.

504
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,820
我妈只有工作上的朋友
'Cause all my mom's got are work friends

505
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,580
其他都是爸爸的朋友
and everyone else was Dad's.

506
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,790
打造一家公司  还挂上自己的姓氏
Well, I'm sure it took a lot of nights and weekends

507
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,380
肯定是要下很大功夫的
to build a firm with her name on the door.

508
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,190
肯定很不容易
That couldn't have been easy.

509
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:18,390
但那也是爸爸的姓氏  这很糟糕
Except the name's Dad's, too, which sucks.

510
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,180
我觉得你风趣聪明
I just think you're fun and smart

511
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,660
她肯定很喜欢你
and she must really like you

512
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,950
因为她没让几个人来过这儿
'cause she does not let a lot of people up here.

513
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,300
我也喜欢她
Well, I like her, too.

514
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:33,170
你们还有大麻吗
Hey, you guys, do you have any of that pot left?

515
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,940
有  但是
Well, yeah, but...

516
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,730
怎么了
What?

517
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:43,150
或许你想试试别的
If you're maybe looking for a different sort of adventure.

518
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,560
我要坦白一件事
So I have a confession.

519
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,860
说吧
Shoot.

520
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,570
我不怎么喜欢德州
I don't care much for Texas.

521
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,890
为什么
Why ever not?

522
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,890
不就是一群德州汉子
Isn't it just a bunch of good old boys

523
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,070
开着横跨绝尘而去吗
in Dixie Trans Ams speeding down dirt roads?

524
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,350
那是佐治亚州  而且李将军是辆战马
That'd be Georgia. And the General Lee is a Charger.

525
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,550
-好吧  -你是没去过吧
- Okay. - Never been, I take it.

526
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,140
是啊
No, I have not.

527
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,480
跟我讲讲
Tell me about it.

528
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,000
跟其他地方一样
Well, it's like any other place

529
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,260
但更多一番风情
except more so.

530
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,600
是吗  就像这里吗
Really? Like this place?

531
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,000
我们什么样都有
Well, we get all kinds.

532
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,810
我得承认  走进来时可没想到会是这番景象
Have to admit, not what I had in mind when we walked in here,

533
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:31,590
但很高兴我们进来了
but glad we did.

534
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,760
你在那儿还有家人  是吗
So you still have family there, yeah?

535
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,680
来
Here.

536
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,770
看看这小家伙
That little feller.

537
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,430
天呐  他真可爱
Oh, my God. He's beautiful.

538
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,630
嗯
Yeah.

539
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,550
真是难以置信  是吧
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it?

540
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,100
天呐  感觉好像就几天前
God, it feels like it was just a few days ago 

541
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,040
我还在给金编辫子
that I was braiding Kim's hair.

542
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,430
现在  她再有一年就从伯克利毕业了
And now she has one year left at Berkeley.

543
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,180
人们都说白驹过隙
Everybody says it passes so fast.

544
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,620
我说不清
I don't know.

545
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,630
我工作那么忙  错过了好多
Working as much as I do, I missed a lot.

546
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,960
是啊  我也是
Yeah, you and me both.

547
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,270
我以为自己要在德州退休的  能常看到他们
I thought I was gonna retire in Texas. You know, be around.

548
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:10,230
每个月带小萨姆去看几场球赛
I'd take little Sam to a ball game a couple times a month.

549
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:14,950
我想能告诉他  我做过有意义的事
I wanted to be able to tell him I did things that mattered.

550
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,510
而现在我的故事没人想听
Now I got stories no one cares about.

551
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,560
我这年纪说这话真傻
Foolish things coming from a man my age.

552
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,290
抱歉
Apologies.

553
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,420
不  不必道歉
No, not at all.

554
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,570
先生们  请欢迎
Gentlemen, welcome to the stage

555
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,520
非凡女士
Lady Divine.

556
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,010
戈登
Gordon? 

557
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,790
我没吵醒你吧
I didn't wake you, did I?

558
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,730
没有  我正要出去
No, no, I'm just heading out.

559
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,630
好吧
Okay, uh...

560
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:55,940
晚安了
well, good night.

561
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,090
-卡梅  -怎么
- Hey, Cam. - Yeah?

562
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,090
今天真好玩
It was really fun today.

563
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,910
是啊
Yeah, it was.

564
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,640
再见  戈登
Bye, Gordon.

565
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,080
你来了
You came.

566
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,330
我们该谈谈
I figured we should talk.

567
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:36,050
来  坐下
Come, sit with me.

568
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,290
我不喜欢这样
I don't like this.

569
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,060
我不喜欢这种感觉
I don't like feeling this way.

570
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,140
我也是
I hate it, too.

571
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,980
我不知道怎么会变成这样
I don't know how we got here.

572
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,480
你骗了我  唐娜
You lied to me, Donna.

573
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,710
我知道  但我
I know, but I--

574
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:04,220
当时并没觉得像撒谎
it didn't feel like a lie at the time.

575
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,460
而是觉得那样对公司更好
It felt like what was best for the company,

576
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,350
对你更好
like what was best for you.

577
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,770
我跟你一样厉害的
I am just as good at this as you are.

578
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,510
从没有人说过你不是
No one ever said you weren't.

579
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,300
他们不用说出来
They don't have to say it.

580
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,280
时刻能感觉到
It's there all the time.

581
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,580
那声音震耳欲聋  卡梅是天才  唐娜是妈妈
It's deafening. Cam is the genius. Donna is the mom.

582
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,520
那我们又退回原地了
So we're back where we started.

583
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,680
不
No.

584
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,210
还没呢
No, not yet.

585
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,640
看看这里
I mean, look at this place.

586
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,610
你想过我们能来到这儿吗
Did you ever think we'd be here?

587
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,810
你要听多少遍
How many times do you need

588
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,200
没有你我是做不到的
to hear that I can't do this without you?

589
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,910
很抱歉我骗了你
I'm sorry that I lied to you.

590
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,070
我原谅你
I forgive you.

591
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,790
-好吧  -好吧
- Well... - Well...

592
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,810
-没想到今晚会发展成这样  -我也是
- Not the night I was expecting. - Nor I.

593
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,340
跟我回家喝一杯吧
Why don't you come back to the house for a nightcap?

594
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,590
有点晚了
You know, it's getting a little late.

595
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,540
我送你回车上吧
Let me just-- I'll just drop you back at your car.

596
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,680
我可以...
You know, I could-- I could...

597
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,770
过去的
come by.

598
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,970
不用了
No, it's fine.

599
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,700
你得承认戈登的原创
You need to give Gordon credit.

600
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,530
随你生我气
Be pissed at me.

601
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:29,820
你有这权利
You have every right.

602
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,210
但是别拿戈登撒气
Just, Jesus, don't take it out on Gordon.

603
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,940
他需要这个
He needs this.

604
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,320
乔  你得对得起他
Joe, do right by him.

605
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,600
承认他创造了什么
Give him credit for what he built.

606
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,890
说话啊
Say something.

607
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:56,860
我们庆祝吧
Shall we celebrate?

608
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,030
为什么
Why?

609
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:03,410
你戴的是结婚戒指吧
That's a wedding ring on your finger, isn't it?

610
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,030
我是来谈戈登的
I came here to talk about Gordon.

611
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,240
是吗
Did you?

612
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,870
现在是凌晨1:30
It's 1:30 in the morning.

613
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,180
你在走廊里等我
You were waiting in my hallway.

614
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,750
就为了谈戈登
To talk about Gordon?

615
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,840
是那个谁吗
Is it what's his name?

616
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,490
无所谓了  可能是任何人
It doesn't matter. Could have been anyone.

617
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,290
你觉得开心  就以为是因为
You were happy for a moment and you thought the person

618
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,710
那个站得离你最近的人
standing closest to you was the source.

619
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,660
相信我
Trust me.

620
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,980
我也有过这种经历
I've been there.

621
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,580
你得承认戈登的原创
You need to give Gordon credit.

622
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,610
有人吗
Hello.

623
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,230
有人吗  我回来了
Hello, I'm home.

624
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,660
妈妈
Mommy, Mommy! 

625
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,070
这是怎么回事
What is all this?

626
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,650
卡梅伦打坏了电视  爸爸就买了台新的
Cameron broke the TV, so Daddy bought a new one.

627
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,090
多大啊
Isn't it so big?

628
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,810
是啊  真大  宝贝
Yeah, it sure is, baby.

629
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,550
那儿怎么样
How was it?

630
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,870
很好  可棒了
It was great. Really great.

631
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,850
我觉得神清气爽
I feel clearer.

632
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,410
你吃多少那个了
Hey, how many of those have you had?

633
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,530
就这一个
Only this one.

634
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:23,540
-她打坏了电视  -说来话长
- She broke the TV, huh? - Yeah, long story.

635
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,420
好吧  她在吗
Okay. Is she home?

636
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,890
她出去了
Well, she-- she went out--

637
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,450
她很晚出去的  我也没听到她回来
she went out late and I didn't hear her come in.

638
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,190
卡梅  卡梅伦
Cam. Cameron.

639
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,680
等等  唐娜  她可能在睡呢
Hold up, Donna. She could be asleep.

640
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,120
卡梅
Cam?

641
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,440
卡梅
Cam.

642
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,390
天呐
Oh, my God.

643
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,450
戈登
Gordon? 

644
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,890
-卡梅伦  -它好使
- Cameron? - It works!

645
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,120
你今天没去办公室
You weren't in the office today.

646
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,780
是啊  我需要一天把这玩意组装起来
Yeah, well, I needed a day to put this thing together.

647
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,420
你怎么没告诉我们你搬走了
Why didn't you tell us you moved out?

648
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,130
我结婚了
I got married.

649
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,700
不  我认真的
No, I'm serious.

650
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:53,970
我跟汤姆在德州结婚了
I got married to Tom back in Texas.

651
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,960
太棒了
That's incredible.

652
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,440
我真替你开心
I'm really happy for you.

653
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,330
谢谢
Thanks.

654
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,580
我也很开心
I'm happy, too.

655
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,180
我不知道你今天也要来参加
I didn't know you were gonna be in this thing today.

656
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:51,810
我不参加
I'm not.

657
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:55,470
我推迟了取证  我们得谈谈
I postponed the depo. We need to talk.

658
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,980
请坐
Have a seat.

659
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,160
不购买  不许诺
No purchases and no promises.

660
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,930
我们说好的
That's what we said.

661
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,500
今早  我收到一份传真
This morning I got a copy of a fax

662
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,160
是国家科学基金网的律师发来的
from the NSFNET lawyers came across my desk.

663
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,010
于是我打给米奇·克劳顿想问个清楚
So when I called Mitch Klowden for clarification,

664
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:16,600
他说  你俩周末时曾进行过愉快的对话
he said that the two of you had a lovely conversation this weekend 

665
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,130
所以我们现在在合作了
and that we're now in business.

666
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:20,640
得了  肯  坐下
Come on, Ken, just sit down.

667
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,810
你完了
You're done.

668
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,580
我今早集合了董事会
I gathered the board this morning

669
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,940
我们投票解除了你的行政权
and we voted to remove your executive authority

670
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,790
并取消了国家科学基金网的交易
and kill the NSFNET deal.

671
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:30,810
肯
Ken.

672
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,910
当然  你完全可以辞职
Of course you're more than welcome to quit,

673
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,960
但我们打算执行四年的不可竞争条款
but we plan to enforce the four-year noncompete.

674
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,350
我劝你
So if I was you, 

675
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,870
还是继续来上班吧  麦克米伦先生
I'd just keep showing up for work, Mr. MacMillan.

676
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,740
像坐山佛一样
Just sit up in that office of yours 

677
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,430
坐在你的办公室里
like Buddha on the goddamn mountain

678
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,360
向科技媒体兜售鬼话
dispensing pearls of nonsense to the tech press,

679
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,510
但你再也别想
but you will never

680
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,060
花麦克米伦实用网络的钱
spend another MacMillan Utility dime,

681
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,320
启动其他项目或发号施令
launch another project or give another order.

682
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,970
你也别想拿消防软管
And before you even dream about running a fire hose

683
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:59,100
冲大办公室或搞其他什么花样
into the bullpen or some other such bullshit,

684
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,130
别忘了我们的律师起草的那些
I would meditate on the Joe MacMillan clause

685
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:04,120
针对你的条款
our lawyers had such fun drawing up.

686
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,540
你敢捣乱
One destructive move from you,

687
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:08,560
你所拥有的普通股就全部烟消云散了
and every point of equity you got goes up in smoke.

688
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,800
决定好了告诉我
Let me know what you decide.

689
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,390
请报上姓名
State your name.

690
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:40,960
乔·麦克米伦
Joe MacMillan.

691
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,920
所在公司和头衔
And your title and place of business, please.

692
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,430
麦克米伦实用网络  创始执行总裁
Founding CEO, MacMillan Utility.

693
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,660
作为执行总裁
And in your capacity as CEO,

694
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,290
你是否经常看到来自外界的软件点子
do you often review outside submissions for software ideas?

695
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:55,260

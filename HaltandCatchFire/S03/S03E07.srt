123
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,110
我找合伙人谈过
I talked to the partners,

124
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,750

听见了吗  戈登
You hear me? Gordon?

126
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,700
听见了  嗯
Y-yeah. Yeah.

127
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,730
戈登  要迟到了
Gordon, we're gonna be late.

128

Heard your avatar could maybe use one.

133
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,180
我以为戈登会更早告诉你
Well, that took Gordon longer than I thought.

134
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,580
我可以说我为你感到高兴吗
Is it okay for me to say I'm happy for you?

135
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,930
可以
You can say that.

136
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,130

So, how bad is it?

141

"麦克米伦先生从一开始就知道

之后再去考虑谎言的后果"

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,510
我想知道全部细节
I want the blow-by-blow.

150
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,480
我就按你说的做
I did what you told me...

151
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,640
也就是什么都没说
which was to say nothing,

152
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,400
这很容易  因为我什么都不知道
which was easy because I know nothing.

153
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,560
很好  既然你已经离开那儿了  我们可以
Good. Now that you're out of there, we can--

154
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,010
但是肯没有炒了我
But Ken didn't fire me.

155
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,780
什么  为什么
What? Why not?

156
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,300
他给你开了什么条件
What did he offer you?

157
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,550
他没给我开任何条件
He didn't offer me anything.

158
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,550
暂时没有
Not yet.

159
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,750
在这结束之前我们
It's probably best if we don't talk

160
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,020
最好别交谈也别见面
or see each other until this is over.

161
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,700
好吧
Okay.

162
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,300
莱恩  你就是这件事里的薄弱点
Look, Ryan, you're the weak link in all this.

163
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,750
他知道搞定我的唯一途径就是通过你
He knows the only way to get to me is through you.

164
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,000
还有十分钟我就要去打保龄球了
So, I'm 10 minutes away from going bowling--

165
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,710
我甚至都不喜欢保龄球
and I don't even like bowling--

166
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,630
但是  不管怎样  有人敲门了
but, anyway, there's a knock at the door.

167
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,230
我就开门了
And I-- I open it.

168
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,820
我以为是那个奇怪的邻居
I'm thinking it's that weird neighbor

169
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,380
问他的缅甸蟒是不是又跑到我院子里来了
asking if his Burmese python is loose in my yard again.

170
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,500
但不是  是卡梅伦
But, no, it's Cameron,

171
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,540
她脸上带着那种表情
and she has this look on her face.

172
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,370
我永远也忘不了
I'll never forget it.

173
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,690
然后呢
What happened next?

174
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,300
好吧  你们在婚礼之前就先度蜜月了
Okay, so you had the honeymoon before the wedding.

175
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,120
你是怎么求婚的呢
And, uh, how did you propose?

176
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,840
-严格说  我没有  -对  是我求婚
- Technically, I didn't. - Yeah, I proposed to him.

177
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,860
不是
Mmm, no.

178
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,240
严格说  你也没有
Technically, you didn't either.

179
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,790
-我求了  -没有
- Yes, I did. - No.

180
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,480
好吧  在某一时刻  卡梅说...
Yeah, at some point, Cam said...

181
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,910
我真希望能一直这样下去
"I wish it could be like this forever."

182
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,970
然后我说  可以的
And I said, "Uh, it could be."

183
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,290
她说  但你不会搬去加州的
And she said, "But you won't move to California."

184
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,030
然后  就这样
And, um, yeah.

185
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,680
然后他说
And then he said,

186
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,360
我不会为女友搬去加州
"I won't move to California for a girlfriend,

187
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,890
但我会为妻子这么做
but I would move there for my wife."

188
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,900
第二天我们就找了个治安法官
And the next day we found a Justice of the Peace.

189
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,310
天哪  戈登  是不是很浪漫
Oh, my God. Gordon, isn't that romantic?

190
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,480
什么
What?

191
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,860
汤姆和卡梅伦的故事
Tom and Cameron's story.

192
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,870
对  恭喜
Right. Um, congratulations.

193
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,700
-好  -谢谢  干杯
- Okay. - Thanks. Cheers.

194
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,800
那你要来穆特尼工作吗
So, um, you gonna come work at Mutiny?

195
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,110
这倒不会
Uh, actually, no.

196
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,500
我们觉得上次我们俩吹了就因为这个
We decided that's what killed things last time, so--

197
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,370
就是  工作和感情搅在一起
you know, mixing a relationship with work.

198
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,630
真的吗
Really?

199
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,050
当然  许多夫妻都是这样的
And by that, I mean that lots of couples do that,

200
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,700
这样很好  只是真不适合我们 
and it's great. It's just-- it's just really not for us.

201
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,750
但我周三会过来一趟
But I'm gonna swing by on Wednesday

202
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,020
和大家打个招呼  我迫不及待想看到
to say hi to the guys. I cannot wait to see

203
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,720
他们听到这消息时的表情
the looks on their faces when they hear.

204
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,070
他们会大吃一惊的
They're gonna be shocked.

205
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,550
博斯可是一点风声都没透
You know, Bos has really kept this under his hat.

206
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,780
博斯
Bos.

207
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,690
我知道我昨晚就该过来的
Look, I know full well I should've come in last night.

208
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,800
你说  我听着
I'm listening.

209
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,800
你听说过点金术吗
Have you heard of the Midas Touch?

210
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,280
我正好与之相反
Well, I got the... opposite of that.

211
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,410
我和我前妻  儿子都不睦
I'm on the outs with my ex-wife and my son--

212
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,620
其实几乎和在德州打过交道的所有人都不和
hell, practically everybody I did business with back in Texas.

213
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,180
还有个重磅消息
And to top it all off,

214
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,040
我蹲过14个月监狱
I did 14 months in a federal prison.

215
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,460
我觉得在我跨过这道门槛前
I thought you should know that...

216
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,810
你该知道这些事
before I cross this threshold.

217
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,430
是拉图纳监狱吧
La Tuna, right?

218
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,030
在埃尔帕索外  中级监狱
Outside El Paso, medium security?

219
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,140
你真觉得我会和一个公司做生意
You really think I'd go into business with a company

220
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,970
却不对其关键人物做背景调查吗
and not do background checks on all of its key players?

221
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,180
你认为我是个关键人物吗
So, you think of me as a "key player"?

222
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,670
你就赶紧把花给我
Just give me the damn flowers

223
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,460
别在那儿没事找事了
and stop making problems where there aren't any.

224
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,540
我只是  我想
Look, I just-- I wanted to--

225
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,100
唐娜  听着
Donna, look,

226
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,340
我们不是只对你保密的  好吧
we weren't keeping it just from you, okay?

227
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,860
汤姆的妈妈上周五才知道
Tom's mom only found out last Friday.

228
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,190
不是  我懂的
No, I get it.

229
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,700
有个没人知道的秘密
It must have been fun

230
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,540
一定很有意思
having a secret nobody knew about.

231
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,870
是有那么一点
Yeah, a little.

232
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,610
但如果你能提前通知我你要搬出去就好了
Would have been nice to get a heads up you were moving out, though.

233
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:28,470
-孩子们很想你  -这是我不好
- The girls really miss you. - Yeah, I regret that.

234
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,710
听着  我只是
Look, it's just, I...

235
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,540
最近不是很能信任你
haven't had the easiest time trusting you lately.

236
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,250
我明白
No, I know.

237
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,050
我觉得可能是因为
I think that's probably

238
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,970
我骗了你
because I lied to you.

239
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,790
我讨厌这样
I hate it.

240
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,500
那感觉很不舒服  很糟糕
It's been uncomfortable and awful,

241
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,330
我真的很讨厌这样
and I just-- I hate it.

242
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,880
是啊
Yeah.

243
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,070
我也想再次信任你
I wanna trust you again.

244
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,460
真的  我希望我们之间的一切
I do. I-- I-- I want things to go back

245
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,260
能回到从前
the way they used to be between us.

246
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,300
我想念那个时候
I miss it.

247
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,840
我也是
I miss it, too.

248
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,510
那么  我们该怎么办
So, where does that leave us?

249
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,660
我们能重新开始吗
Can we just start over?

250
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,010
好
Yeah.

251
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,420
好  我们重新开始
Yeah, let's just... have a fresh start.

252
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,870
-重新开始  -没错
- A fresh start. - Yeah.

253
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,700
所以本着彻底坦诚的精神
So, in the spirit of complete honesty,

254
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,140
我也考虑了很久
I've been giving it a lot of thought,

255
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,190
我真的认为我们该上市
and I really think we should go public.

256
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,750
好  我并不完全反对
Okay. Well, I'm not completely opposed to it.

257
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,770
-你不反对吗  -不
- You're not? - No.

258
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,520
这里有上市的热潮嘛
I mean, we're in the land of the IPO.

259
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,070
如果我不接受的话
If I wasn't open to it,

260
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,700
我就应该留在德州
I would've just stayed in Texas.

261
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,120
想象一下能拥有
Imagine having the resources

262
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,960
让公司按我们意愿发展的资源
to take the company wherever we wanna go.

263
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,860
是啊  我的构想相当庞大  
Yeah, I have a pretty big imagination.

264
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,660
我就指望你呢
I'm counting on it.

265
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,880
唐娜  你来了
Donna, you're here.

266
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,650
昨晚过后
So, after last night,

267
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,670
我一直在考虑
I haven't been able to stop thinking

268
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,110
在公开募股之前
about all the things we can do

269
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,210
该如何改善穆特尼
to upgrade Mutiny before the IPO.

270
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,540
我写了一些想法
I wrote down some ideas,

271
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,870
我认为我们应该马上执行
and I think we should get started right away.

272
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,340
-很多啊  -是  我知道
- There's a lot here. - Yeah, I know, I know.

273
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,880
我一开始
It's like once I started,

274
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,470
就刹不住了
the floodgates opened.

275
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,600
显然  你对此投入了很多精力和想法
Well, you've obviously put a lot of thought and effort into this.

276
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,450
确实
I did.

277
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,040
这不仅回归了穆特尼和跳蚤市场的本源
It totally reconfigures Mutiny and SwapMeet

278
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,520
还完全重塑了它们
while returning them to their roots,

279
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,280
取其精华  去其糟粕
excising everything that's bad and keeping what's good.

280
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,230
这能让我们不再受限于康懋达电脑
And, it takes us beyond the Commodore

281
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,130
可以在其他系统上运行
onto other platforms

282
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,460
这我们必须实现
which we have to do.

283
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,670
这是我在凌晨五点左右想到的
That became obvious around 5:00 a.m.

284
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,910
其他系统  对
Other platforms, right.

285
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,600
你认为这得花多长时间
How long do you see that taking?

286
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,460
一年  也许是两年
A year. Maybe two.

287
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,950
但目标是把它做好  对吗
But the goal is to do it right. Right?

288
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,740
我肯定你在这里列出来的一切都很棒
I'm sure everything that you've outlined here is great.

289
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,750
真的
I am.

290
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,590
但我们等不了两年
But we can't afford to wait two years.

291
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,930
我们当然等得了
Sure we can.

292
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,610
首次公开募股的时间表是三个月
The timeframe for the IPO is three months.

293
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,890
三个月吗
Three months?

294
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,430
没人说过是三个月
No one ever said anything about three months.

295
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,460
为什么突然变成三个月了
Why is that suddenly the magic number?

296
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,810
因为我们目前手上有个收购案
Because we have an acquisition offer in hand.

297
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,840
现在有人在关注我们
People are paying attention to us right now.

298
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,120
但我们的产品现在不行
But what we have right now is broken.

299
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,190
就我们现在的状态
What we have right now,

300
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,470
计算机服务认为值两千万美元
CompuServe thinks is worth $20 million.

301
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,840
对  但如果我们做出我们能做的改善
Yes, but if we make the improvements the way I know we can,

302
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,520
我们将值一亿美元
we'll be worth $100 million.

303
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,010
我以为我们已经达成一致了
I thought we were in agreement on this.

304
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,400
我们还是能达成一致的
We still can be.

305
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,670
我真的不想这么做
Okay, look, I really hate to play this card,

306
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,640
但作为公司负责人  我要说
but as head of the company, I'm saying

307
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,720
我们必须暂缓上市的事
that we'll need to put the brakes on any IPO

308
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,540
直到我们把自己调理好
until we get our house in order.

309
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,690
好吧  不如这样
Okay, how about this?

310
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,350
我会仔细地看看这个
I will read this more closely

311
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,640
更好地理解你是怎么想的
to get a better understanding of what you have in mind--

312
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,890
太好了  好
Great. Okay.

313
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,480
如果你有什么不明白的地方  就来问我
And if there's anything you don't understand, just ask me.

314
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,980
我保证  这么做才是对的
I promise, this is the way to go.

315
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,570
我刚刚挂了《福布斯》的电话
I just got off the phone with "Forbes"

316
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,830
他们似乎是来者不善
and it doesn't sound like a generous piece.

317
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,730
他们问我西方集团的事
They're asking me questions about WestGroup,

318
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,290
问我卡迪夫的事  还有IBM的事
questions about Cardiff, questions about IBM.

319
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,380
他们显然是有观点了
Listen, they've clearly got an angle

320
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,830
而且不是向着我的观点
and it is not one that is favorable to me.

321
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,140
我再打给你
I'm calling you back.

322
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,990
看来你和律师谈过了
I guess you talked to your lawyers.

323
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,580
这里...
This is...

324
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,810
和我想象的不一样
not what I expected.

325
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,470
我真喜欢那个沙发
I sure do love that couch.

326
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,550
你请设计师了吧
I take it you used a designer?

327
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,120
我和唐娜也有个这样的花瓶
And, hey, me and Donna have this same vase.

328
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,030
-在一号码头买的吧  -那不是花瓶
- Pier 1, right? - It's not a vase.

329
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:09,640
是我委托东京艺术家阪庭伽椰子做的
I commissioned that from Kayako Sakaniwa, a Tokyo artist.

330
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,710
她给它取名为"风和日丽"
She calls it "Serenity."

331
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,550
戈登  我想除了装修
Gordon, I imagine you have some questions...

332
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,790
-你还有其他问题要问吧  -并没有
- beyond the decor. - Not really.

333
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,130
你显然是想被解雇
You obviously wanted to get fired.

334
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,740
这招我以前见识过
I've seen that move fore.

335
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,160
没这么简单
It's, it's more complicated than that.

336
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,170
是吗
Yeah?

337
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,480
真让我吃惊
Shocker.

338
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,360
天呐  这景色真是绝了
Man, this is one kick-ass view.

339
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,730
从这儿能看见大桥
You can see the bridge from here.

340
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,160
我敢说这房子的钱你全都赚回来了
I'll bet you get back every dollar you put into this place.

341
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,120
该死  我都想从你手里买下来
Hell, I might even buy it from you--

342
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,950
家具  风和日丽花瓶
the furniture, the Serenity vase--

343
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,020
所有的一切
the whole kit and caboodle.

344
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,520
我从没想过让你白干
I never wanted you not to profit.

345
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,160
"我  乔·麦克米伦
"I, Joe MacMillan,

346
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,620
从克拉克电脑公司的戈登·克拉克
stole the code to our security softwa

347
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,080
手中偷了杀毒软件的代码
from Gordon Clark of Clark Computers.

348
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,160
我挣来的一切都是他的"
Everything I've earned is his."

349
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,060
这是你说过的最诚实的话
It's the most truthful thing you've ever said.

350
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,540
老实说  我被打动了
Honestly, I was moved.

351
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,870
没想到你是个刻薄的胜利者
I never figured you for a sore winner.

352
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,890
我也没想到  但是知道
Me, either, but it's nice to know

353
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,670
我们还能让自己意外也挺好的
we can still surprise ourselves.

354
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,520
我们不如废话少说
So, what do you say we cut through the bullshit

355
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,800
你告诉我你究竟打的什么主意
and you just tell me what your angle is in all this?

356
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,230
事实上
The truth is--

357
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,750
这是真话
and this is the truth--

358
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,090
我遇到了一件我深信是...
I have come across something that I am convinced is--

359
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,400
我真心相信的东西
well, it's something that I really believe in,

360
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,800
是什么我就不说了
and we'll leave it at that.

361
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,300
但我无法让董事会也认同它的价值
But I couldn't convince my board of its value,

362
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,880
所以我无视他们  放手去干了
so I ignored them, I moved forward,

363
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,290
就这样  我失去了我的公司
and just like that, I lost my company.

364
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,410
我已无计可施  然后我想到
I was out of moves, and then it occurred to me,

365
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,470
如果那不是我的公司呢
what if it wasn't my company?

366
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,330
这么说  你坑了你邪恶的公司老大
So, you screw over your evil corporate overlord

367
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,520
把你的股份甩给了我
by parachuting your stake out to me.

368
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,480
好吧  这我算明白了
Okay, I get that... sort of.

369
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,310
你要怎么获得最终胜利
How do you come out on top in this scenario?

370
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,530
我不会
I don't.

371
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,580
我拥有的一切都属于你了
Everything I had is yours.

372
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,710
如果你觉得我应得一份的话
If you feel like I deserve a percentage,

373
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,600
那也完全取决于你
well, that is entirely up to you.

374
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,980
这么说  你的打算就是让我给你钱吗
So, your plan was for me to just give you the money?

375
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,480
在你从我这儿偷了一切后
After you stole everything from me?

376
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,110
程序是你写的  我同意
You wrote the code, agreed,

377
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,870
但是我两次邀你入伙
but I offered you partnership twice,

378
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,410
你也拒绝我两次
and you turned me down twice.

379
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,910
我必须相信你没那么目光短浅
I have to think that you're not so myopic

380
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,950
以至于不能承认我把它变成了如今的样子
that you can't see that I might be entitled to a little return

381
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,520
也应得到一点回报
for turning it into what I've turned it into.

382
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,520
这件作品很有意思
This is an interesting piece.

383
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,050
这是谁的杰作
And whose work is this?

384
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:47,870
我的
Mine.

385
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,410
戈登  跟你说清楚 
Gordon, to be clear,

386
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,130
你不需要给我任何东西
you don't have to give me anything.

387
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,220
谢谢你澄清了
Thanks for making that clear.

388
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,460
但是公司是我一手建立的
But I built an entire company

389
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,020
而我刚把一切都交给你了
and I've just handed you everything.

390
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,270
现在我只想要点中间人报酬
All I am asking for is basically a finder's fee.

391
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,350
乔  我真的很喜欢这个
Joe, I really do like this piece.

392
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,850
它叫什么名字
What do you call it?

393
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,930
是幅抽象画
It's an abstract.

394
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,100
是吗
Yeah?

395
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,500
但依我看
'Cause it seems to me like

396
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,140
像是那种
one of those paintings that

397
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,930
你越看
the more you look at it,

398
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,870
越能看清楚的画
the more it seems to come into focus.

399
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,390
戈登  我知道  我寄于了你很大信念
Gordon, I know this is a leap of faith on my part,

400
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,780
但信念  正是我的追求
but faith is somethin' I'm workin' on.

401
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,780
信念是一个...
Faith is a--

402
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,710
信念是一个很可贵的东西
faith is a valuable thing.

403
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,360
只是我不想把它寄托在你身上
I'd just look for somewhere else to place it.

404
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,590
谢谢你的公司  乔
Thanks for the company, Joe.

405
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,500
唐娜
Donna.

406
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,530
出什么事了吗
Is everything okay?

407
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,490
卡梅隆简直疯了
Cameron's gone off the deep end

408
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,970
我不知道该怎么办
and I don't know what to do.

409
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,070
她今天带来了这份穆特尼声明
She came in today with this Mutiny manifesto

410
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,770
想阻止上市
that will kill the IPO.

411
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,840
而且她决心已定
And she's committed to it.

412
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,830
她就差把这个钉在我脑门上了
She did everything but nail it to my forehead.

413
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,990
也许我今晚该好好研究下这个
Maybe I should take the night to read this over.

414
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,590
还等什么  现在就看吧  我可以等
Why wait? Why not read it now? I can wait.

415
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,800
因为我觉得她是不想你
Because I think she's tryin' to stop you

416
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,630
发现我在这儿
from figurin' out I'm here.

417
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,790
博斯  我...
Bos! I--

418
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,410
我们是最近发展起来的
It's a relatively recent development.

419
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,510
但别担心卡梅隆会知道
But if you're worried about Cameron finding out,

420
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,020
我已经一个多月没和她讲话了
I haven't talked to her in over a month.

421
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,720
你想说什么就说什么吧
So, say what you came to say.

422
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,050
-计划很多啊  -是啊
- This is a lot. - Yeah.

423
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,430
实施起来要多长时间
How long to implement?

424
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,890
一年  也许两年
A year. Maybe two.

425
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,930
这也等太久了
That's a long time to wait.

426
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,950
她为什么反对上市
Why is she against the IPO?

427
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,160
她并不  这就是让人抓狂的地方
She's not, and that's what makes it so frustrating,

428
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,940
但卡梅伦就这样
but it's what happens with Cameron--

429
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,630
博斯  你也知道
and, Bos, you can back me up--

430
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,240
她总是想做什么做什么
she gets in her own way.

431
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,370
这事没那么简单
It's a little more complicated than that,

432
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,120
但这也算没说错
but I suppose that's part of it.

433
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,480
那你有什么打算
So, what do you want to do?

434
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,970
我不知道
I don't know.

435
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,680
卡梅伦弄得像自己是大股东  但她不是
Cameron acts like she's majority shareholder, but she's not.

436
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,270
她比其他人的票数都高
She's got more votes than anyone,

437
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,160
但不比所有人高
but not more votes than everyone.

438
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,150
我还是希望你们求同存异
I'd prefer you to find common ground.

439
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,590
真的不行吗
Are you sure you can't?

440
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,860
你今早刚告诉我
Just this morning you were telling me

441
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,440
你很高兴地庆祝了她的新婚呢
what a wonderful time you had celebrating her marriage,

442
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,630
很开心能开启新的篇章
how you were excited to start a new chapter.

443
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,550
没错  然后她就把这玩意丢给我了
Right, and then she comes in and dumps this on me.

444
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,900
慢着
Back up a beat.

445
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,720
卡梅伦结婚了
Cameron got married?

446
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,280
博斯  我以为你知道
Bos, I assumed you knew.

447
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,380
-抱歉  -不用
- I'm sorry. - Don't be.

448
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,580
这事也不该你来说
Wasn't your news to tell.

449
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,040
你把这里布置得不错
Love what you've done with the place.

450
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,700
跟黛安喝酒了吗
Drinks with Diane?

451
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,680
没喝
Diane, no drinks.

452
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,720
卡梅伦对上市的事改主意了
It's Cameron. She changed her mind about the IPO.

453
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,890
怎么  她不想做吗
What? She wants to kill it?

454
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,230
这不是她的初衷
That is not her intent,

455
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,870
但如果按她的来  结果便会如此
but if she has her way, it will be the result.

456
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,430
很遗憾
Well, sorry to hear that.

457
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:24,370
一切还没定  但如果想上市
Nothing's settled yet, but moving forward

458
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,000
就得让所有股东否决她
means getting all the equity owners to overrule her.

459
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,270
我们有35%  还有黛安和博斯
We've got 35%, and then there's Diane and Bos

460
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,760
道格和克雷格
and Doug and Craig.

461
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,310
卡梅伦对这事毫不知情吗
And Cameron has no idea this is happening?

462
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,850
一切还没开始  还在计划阶段
Nothing is happening. It's all talk at the moment,

463
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,190
但我得考虑所有办法
but I have to explore every option.

464
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,000
我们并不占公司35%的股权
We don't own 35% of the company.

465
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,600
-我们有  -不  你有25%
- Yeah, sure we do. - No, you own 25%

466
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,740
克拉克电脑买了主机  占有10%
and Clark Computers owns 10% for buying the mainframe.

467
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,200
克拉克电脑  也就是我
And Clark Computers, I.E., me,

468
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,540
不想瞒着卡梅伦
doesn't like the idea of blindsiding Cameron

469
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,300
逼她接受上市
and shoving this IPO down her throat.

470
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,030
这...
That's-- that is--

471
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,700
完全不是我的意思
just a gross mischaracterization. I--

472
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,410
唐娜  如果你这么做
Donna, if you pull this move,

473
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,560
我保证她会觉得你在向她宣战
I guarantee you she'll see it as an act of war.

474
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,050
这是个无法挽回的过界之举
and you will cross a line that you cannot uncross.

475
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,420
别骗自己了
So, don't kid yourself.

476
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:25,250
今天太累了  我睡了
It's been a long day. I'm going to bed.

477
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:35,130
你见过麦克米伦先生和戈登·克拉克说话吗
Did you ever witness Mr. MacMillan talking to Gordon Clark?

478
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,580
没有
Nope.

479
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,500
麦克米伦先生曾经
Did Mr. MacMillan ever

480
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,160
向戈登·克拉克吐露过他的计划吗
confide any plans he had with Gordon Clark?

481
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,460
没有
No.

482
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,590
你不觉得奇怪吗
Don't you find it odd,

483
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,260
我们取消国家科学基金网交易
the day we eighty-sixed NSFNET

484
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,890
炒了乔的那天
and we shit-canned Joe

485
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,600
他就长了良心  说戈登发明了
he finds religion and says Gordon invented

486
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,130
这个公司的基石软件
the software this company's built on,

487
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,540
给了他的前合伙人
giving his ex-partner,

488
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,990
在告他的人  一切
the one suing him, everything?

489
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,660
也许你不知道
Or maybe you didn't know.

490
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,840
也许乔没告诉过你这些事
Maybe Joe didn't tell you that part.

491
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,050
我一直以为你也参与了
And I always assumed that you were involved.

492
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,540
他们没把你踢出局吧
They didn't cut you out of the deal, did they?

493
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,610
不用回答
No need to answer.

494
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,550
对不起  孩子  这事很大
Look, I'm sorry, kid. It's bigger than you.

495
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,650
而你只是乔牺牲掉的一个棋子
You're just a pawn that Joe sacrificed in the end game,

496
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,320
所以你对我们没用了
which means that you're useless to us.

497
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,200
也许你对他也没有用了
You're probably useless to him, too.

498
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,450
那么...
So...

499
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,200
就这样吧
that's it.

500
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,490
你该走了
It's time for you to go.

501
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,960
-我被炒了  -是的
- So, I'm fired? - Yes.

502
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,460
好
Good.

503
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,860
克拉克先生  他们在等你了
Mr. Clark? They're ready for you.

504
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,360
戈登  你来干什么
Gordon, what are you doing here?

505
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,950
莱恩  你是对的
Ryan. You were right.

506
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,090
你和乔合作的那个东西
That thing that you and Joe were working on?

507
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,190
前途无量
It's gonna be huge.

508
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,370
克拉克先生  不管麦克米伦先生
So, Mr. Clark, regardless of what Mr. MacMillan

509
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,790
自以为做到了什么
thinks he got away with,

510
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,580
我们都打算对其供述的真实性提出异议
we plan to fully challenge the veracity of his confession.

511
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,310
我觉得我们不用律师就能速战速决
Listen, I think we can speed things up without the lawyers.

512
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,530
我的律师就没来
I mean, I don't have mine.

513
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,000
不如你也叫他走吧
What do we say you lose yours?

514
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,270
你不是真想让我相信
You're not really gonna try to convince me

515
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,790
你和乔没有串通好吧
that you and Joe didn't talk about this, right?

516
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,370
我没打算让你信什么
I'm not gonna try and convince you of anything.

517
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,310
我想和你做交易
I'm here to offer you a deal

518
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,510
让你不需要再想那个问题
that will make that question irrelevant.

519
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:07,410
我的律师说我最少能拿到两千五百万
Now, my lawyers say I'm looking at a floor of 25 million.

520
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:10,630
-你的律师在做梦  -我只要10%
- Your lawyers are dreaming. - I'm willing to take 10% of that,

521
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,320
还要乔买下的装置
along with the equipment that Joe bought

522
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,600
和他与国家科学基金网达成的协议
and the deals that he made for NSFNET.

523
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,420
就算我想接受交易
Even if I wanted to make that deal,

524
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,860
我不能把政府合同就这么给你
I can't just hand you a government contract.

525
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,370
我可以把基础设施卖给你
I mean, I could trade you the infrastructure,

526
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,510
但你得去投标
but you would have to chase that bid.

527
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,850
不  我觉得为了两千万
No, I think for 20 million,

528
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,350
你可以打电话给地区主管
you can make a call to the sector chief

529
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,650
办妥这件事
and make that happen.

530
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,360
或者我可以起诉你  保住一切
Or I could just sue you and keep it all.

531
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,990
你可以  但你会输
Yeah, you could, but you'll lose,

532
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,620
我觉得你很清楚
and I think you know that.

533
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,100
按我的方式来  你能用你根本不在乎的东西
We do it my way, I'm giving you everything that you want

534
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,240
来换取所有你想要的东西
in exchange for nothing you care about.

535
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,930
我有一件事放不下
One thing sticks in my craw.

536
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,100
如果我们达成协议
We make this deal,

537
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,800
你转头就把乔想要的东西全给他了
you turn around and give Joe everything he wants

538
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,620
那混蛋又赢了
and that son of a bitch wins again.

539
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,840
你为什么觉得
And what makes you think

540
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,410
这里只有你
you're the only one in this room

541
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,420
想对付乔·麦克米伦
that wants to stick it to Joe MacMillan?

542
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,280
好了  赶紧把这事搞定
Okay, let's get this over with.

543
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,710
如果阿基利用这个理由
Remember to detach Arki from me

544
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,400
抱我超过正常时间
when he uses this as an excuse

545
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,610
你要记得把他赶走
to hug me past a socially acceptable amount of time.

546
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,270
我记得了
I got it, all right?

547
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,290
我们去吓吓他们吧  豪伊兰顿太太
Let's go fry some coders' circuits, Mrs. Howe-Rendon.

548
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:11,340
-不好  -兰顿豪伊呢
- No. - Rendon-Howe?

549
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,450
-我们再想吧  -好
- We'll figure it out. - Okay.

550
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,690
-汤姆  -兰顿
- Tom? - Rendon!

551
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,260
-老兄  -你怎么来了
- Dude! - What are you doin' here?

552
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,590
浪子回归了
The prodigal son returns.

553
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:32,280
汤姆弹
Tom the Bomb!

554
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,360
可算来了个好程序员
Finally, a real coding lead.

555
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,700
你来多久  兰顿
How long you here for, Rendon?

556
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,580
算是定居了
Kind of indefinitely.

557
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,310
-不会吧  -等等  什么
- No. - Wait a minute. What?

558
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,410
-是啊  我们结婚了  -什么时候的事
- Yeah, we got married! - When did this happen?

559
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,740
几周前在德州
A couple weeks ago in Texas.

560
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,140
-你不是怀孕了吧  -你看我像吗
- You're n pregnant, are you? - Do I look pregnant?

561
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,690
怎么没请我
Why wasn't I invited?

562
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,480
-过来  -天呐
- Come here, you. - Oh, God.

563
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,590
过来吧
Come on.

564
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,840
-真替你开心  -行了
- So happy for you. - Okay, all right.

565
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,410
-谢谢  -你真是幸运
- Thank you. - You're a very lucky man.

566
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:02,230
庆祝穆特尼首个正式婚姻
Here's to Mutiny's first official marriage!

567
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,680
愿你们白头到老
May it a be long and happy one.

568
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,340
好了  谁想来点
Okay, who wants some of that?

569
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,720
看上去不错啊
This looks great.

570
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,370
博迪  你能不能别对瓶吹了
Bodie, would you stop drinking out of the bottle, dude?

571
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,180
别直接对口了  拜托
Just stop drinking out of the bottle. Come on, man.

572
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,770
-我肯定能喝完  -你还得留肚子吃蛋糕
- I bet I can finish it. - You have to leave room for cake.

573
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,100
-不  -看啊
- No-- - Look it.

574
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,650
干什么
What, dude?

575
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,970
CQ  CQ
CQ! CQ!

576
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,840
恭喜
Congratulations.

577
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,620
来点蛋糕吧
Have some cake.

578
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,000
超市买的  这种最好了
It's supermarket bought, but that's the best kind.

579
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,260
化学精华
Chemical goodness.

580
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,160
我得跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

581
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,310
好
Okay.

582
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,670
别在这儿
Not here.

583
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,860
好
Yeah.

584
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,560
唐娜还是想上市
Donna wants to move forward with the IPO...

585
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,100
不管你同不同意
with or without you.

586
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,460
好吧  真是的
Okay. Tough titties.

587
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,730
我不想  这是我的公司
I don't want to, and it's my company.

588
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,040
你是多数股东
You're the plurality shareholder.

589
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,560
你的股份最多
You own the most.

590
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,520
但如果她能让
But if she gets everyone else

591
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,860
公司其他股东都站在她这边
with a stake in this company to side with her,

592
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,900
她就能否决你的决定
she can overrule you.

593
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,390
好吧
Okay.

594
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,070
道格和克雷格显然
Doug and Craig will obviously

595
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,800
会抓住坑我的机会
jump at the chance to screw me.

596
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,320
但就算她说服了黛安
But even if she manages to convince Diane,

597
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,580
那还有你和博斯呢  没戏的
that's still leaves you and Bos. Game over.

598
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,070
还有博斯
It leaves Bos.

599
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,070
我必须支持她
My vote's gotta be with her...

600
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,670
就算我反对
even if I'm against it.

601
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,150
对不起
I'm sorry.

602
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,820
她还在上面给我开派对
She's out there throwing me a party.

603
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,270
你要帮那个撒谎的两面派...
and you're gonna side with that lying, two-faced, bi--

604
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:15,650
小心  她还是我妻子
Careful, okay? That's my wife.

605
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,880
你真幸运
Lucky you.

606
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,870
卡梅
Cam.

607
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,250
-是啊  -卡梅伦
- Yeah, there's just-- - Cameron!

608
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,560
恭喜  我很替你们开心
Congratulations. I'm so happy for the two of you.

609
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,460
谢谢  能说句话吗
Yeah, thanks. Can I borrow you?

610
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,340
喂
Hello?

611
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,410
我得问你句话
I have to ask you something,

612
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,380
我需要你说实话
and I need you to be completely honest with me,

613
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,050
因为我不知道该信什么了
because I don't know what to believe anymore.

614
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,570
别撒谎  好吗
So, don't lie to me, okay?

615
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,160
你想问什么
What do you want to ask me?

616
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,950
你是跟戈登一起策划好的吗
Did you plan this whole thing with Gordon?

617
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,990
你要执行国家科学基金网的计划而不带我吗
Are you moving forward with NSFNET and cutting me out?

618
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,610
当然不会
No, of course not.

619
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,160
你为什么会这么想
Where did you get an idea like this?

620
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,520
我需要你帮忙
I need something from you,

621
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,190
我知道我们从德州回来之后
and I know things have been super awkward between us

622
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,010
我们之间就很尴尬
since we got back from Texas.

623
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,610
我该说点什么的  但我没有
I should have said something, but I didn't.

624
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:20,350
你也没
I mean, you didn't either,

625
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,960
但那现在不是重点
but that's not the point right now.

626
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,490
重点是  我知道我们现在有别的矛盾
The point is, I know it's not cool to ask for something

627
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,590
不该来求你帮忙
when there's this other thing between us,

628
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:29,870
但我现在真的需要你帮忙
but I really, really need your help right now.

629
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,420
你打算什么时候告诉我的
When were you gonna tell me?

630
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,020
博斯  我也才知道
Bos, I just found out myself.

631
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,360
我并不知道唐娜打算绕过我
I didn't know Donna was gonna try an end run around me.

632
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,450
你结婚的事
About your marriage.

633
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,620
卡梅  我知道你不把我当做父亲
Look, Cam, I know you don't think of me as a father.

634
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,900
你说得很清楚了  这没关系
You made that clear. That's okay.

635
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,550
你想怎么想就怎么想
You're gonna feel the way you wanna feel.

636
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,960
但我还是会把你当女儿
But it won't stop me thinkin' of you as a daughter.

637
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,720
告诉我怎么办
So, tell me what to do.

638
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,700
首先  别把你跟唐娜的矛盾扩大化
First off, don't make this thing with Donna any bigger than it is.

639
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,600
你俩就是意见不一致而已
You two have a difference of opinion, that's all.

640
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:16,780
我之所以会来这儿  就是因为你
The only reason I'm here in the first place is because of you.

641
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,730
我爱你  也欠你的
I love you and I owe you.

642
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,410
但这已经不是你一个人的公司了
But it's not just your company. Not anymore.

643
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:30,620
你有种很特别的才华  孩子
You got-- you got a special kind of talent, sweetheart.

644
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,580
但如果你按自己的节拍走
But when you march to the beat of your own drum,

645
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,540
就可能失去整个乐队
you risk losin' the band.

646
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,910
说出你的想法
Lay out your vision.

647
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,950
想办法跟她合作
Find a way to work with her.

648
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,470
你俩需要彼此
You two need each other.

649
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,620
博斯
Hey, Bos?

650
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,240
我结婚了
I got married.

651
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:10,990
恭喜你
Congratulations.

652
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,930
你知道在给你开派对吧  不能回头说吗
You do realize you have a party going on? This can't wait?

653
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,880
不能  请坐下
No. Please sit down.

654
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,990
我对穆特尼的走向
I've had some concerns

655
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,850
有些担忧
about Mutiny's direction,

656
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:54,010
而我没能好好表达这些担忧
concerns I haven't effectively expressed.

657
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,520
这怪我
That's on me.

658
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,540
现在我们发展得很快
Things are moving fast,

659
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:02,280
比我预期的快得多
faster than I ever imagined they would.

660
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,380
这很令人激动
It's an exciting time.

661
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,720
但我们走到了十字路口
But we are at a crossroads

662
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,700
我们需要做决定  一起决定
and we have a decision to make... together.

663
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,870
我知道你们都想上市
I know you all want to move forward on the IPO.

664
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,330
我也想
I do, too.

665
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:19,150
但我认为急着上市  对我们并不是最好的
But I don't think rushing into it is in our best interests.

666
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,150
我能说一句吗
Can I say a quick word?

667
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:26,380
公司的价值在于它现在的状况
The company is valued for what it is and does right now.

668
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:30,920
市场现在喜欢穆特尼  但再过一两年
The market likes Mutiny, but in a year or two,

669
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,980
或者等我们实施完毕
or however long it takes to implement

670
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,390
你所构想的改变  谁知道呢
the changes you have in mind, who knows?

671
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:40,230
我们不能指望未来的情势还跟如今一样
We can't count on tomorrow's landscape looking like today's.

672
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,890
穆特尼现在的样子是维持不下去的
Mutiny isn't sustainable as it exists now.

673
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,620
我们整个用户群都是康懋达64用户
Our whole user base is tied to the Commodore 64.

674
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,700
我们想要发展就得开发其他平台
We need to diversify to other platforms in order to grow.

675
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,820
这不就是华尔街喜欢的吗  发展
And isn't that what Wall Street likes? Growth?

676
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,110
我所构想的投资
The kind of investment that I'm talking about

677
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,310
日后终会有收获
in time and money will pay off

678
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,270
聪明的投资者会明白的
and smart investors will see that.

679
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,200
你的点子很棒  卡梅伦
Your ideas are good, Cameron,

680
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,270
有些非常好
and some of them are even great.

681
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:06,220
我也想跟你一起探索你的每个点子
And I want to explore them with you, all of them.

682
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,610
但为什么不能在
But why can't we do that

683
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,720
上市之后做呢
after we've gone public?

684
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,980
我们不用等着把它做到完美
We don't have to wait to try and make something perfect.

685
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,040
完美是好的敌人
Perfect is the enemy of good,

686
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:20,800
穆特尼现在就很好了
and Mutiny is very, very good right now as it is.

687
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,190
唐娜  你最近上过跳蚤市场吗
Donna, have you been on SwapMeet lately?

688
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,420
就像个8位的商场
It's like an 8-bit mall.

689
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,700
它失去了其社区的本质
It's lost what made it a community.

690
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,990
我们得重新给它注入活力
We need to make it feel alive again

691
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,240
否则大家会离开的
or people are going to leave

692
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,880
只剩下我们给一群三流小店开商场
and we'll just be hosting a bunch of tacky businesses

693
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,360
叫卖破烂  没人买
selling junk to nobody.

694
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,230
但是
But--

695
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,240
求你
Please.

696
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,590
我们不能太天真
We can't afford to be naive here.

697
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,100
如果我们推迟改变
If we put off these changes,

698
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,940
就不能好好施行它们了
we won't be able to make them the right way.

699
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,240
是按你的方式吧
You mean your way.

700
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,530
我们将会太过在意市盈率
I mean, we'll be so focused on PE ratios

701
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,010
和股东价值
and shareholder value,

702
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,930
而不能迅速创新  反应
that we won't be able to innovate and respond quickly.

703
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,240
穆特尼就不再是穆特尼了
Mutiny won't be Mutiny anymore.

704
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,640
我们会失去公司的灵魂
We'll lose the company's soul.

705
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,410
如果按你的办法来
Say we do it your way.

706
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,640
万一你的点子  虽然它们很棒
What happens if your ideas, good as they are,

707
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,090
但行不通或适得其反了呢
don't work or backfire?

708
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,780
那我们就可能丧失现在的价值
We risk losing our current valuation.

709
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,350
上市不代表就要停止创新
Going public doesn't mean we stop innovating.

710
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:19,220
我们可以同时继续实验  改进
We can continue to experiment and improve as we go,

711
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,390
尤其有你这样聪明的人给我们带路
especially with someone as brilliant as you leading the way.

712
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,790
别哄我
Don't patronize me.

713
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,410
我没那个意思
I'm not patronizing you.

714
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:29,490
你又像以往一样在对付我  我受够了
You're handling me like you always do, and I'm sick of it.

715
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,310
我在向公司股东解释
Listen, I'm trying to explain some very real risks

716
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,150
真实存在
that you're not willing to acknowledge

717
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,620
而你不肯承认的风险
to actual stakeholders in the company.

718
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,660
我们不能太冲动
We can't afford to be impulsive here.

719
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,690
你还说我冲动
You're calling me impulsive?

720
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,370
这话什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

721
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,850
我觉得外面的人就在庆祝你的冲动
I think people are out there celebrating what that means.

722
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,740
你是指你为了不让我发现
Oh, you mean that bullshit little party you threw

723
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,870
你背后捅刀行为而开的破派对吗
to distract me from getting stabbed in the back?

724
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:49,730
-好啊  -行了  女士们
- Okay. - Okay, ladies,

725
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,340
我们偏离主题了
we are getting off track here.

726
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,750
黛安  她说的大多是你的想法
Diane, it's mostly your thoughts coming out of her mouth,

727
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,610
所以我不知你还能提出什么新意见
so I can't imagine what you have to add to the discussion.

728
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:58,360
天呐  真不知我们谁该更觉得受冒犯
Jesus! I don't know who should be more insulted.

729
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,710
相信我  如果我说什么
Trust me, if I'm expressing an opinion,

730
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,790
那肯定是我的想法
it's because I believe it.

731
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,650
我是该相信你
I should trust you. Yes, of course!

732
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,230
除非你又在撒谎
I mean, unless you're lying now,

733
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,380
就像之前你在道格和克雷格的事上撒了谎
like you lied about Doug and Craig.

734
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,740
你知道吗
Did you know about that?

735
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,060
你告诉她可以解雇他们
That when you told her it was fine if I fired them,

736
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,220
结果她却告诉我必须留下他们
she told me that I had to keep them on?

737
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,100
你就想跟这种人
Is that the sort of person

738
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,180
继续做生意吗
that you wanna trust with this business going forward?

739
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,620
你是指一个
You mean the kind of person

740
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,550
努力想维持下去
who actually tries to make things work

741
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,660
而不是跟每个
instead of fighting with

742
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,890
威胁了她"救世主情节"的人打架的人吗
anybody who threatens her "savior complex"?

743
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,430
我跟人相处得很好
I get along fine with people.

744
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,340
你疏远每一个人
You alienate everybody.

745
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,350
你一个想尽一切理由不回家
Says the woman that will take any excuse

746
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,260
见她丈夫的女人也好意思说
not to go home to her husband.

747
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,010
先看看你的婚姻能不能坚持到明年
Why don't we see if your marriage lasts the year

748
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:35,420
你再提出感情建议吧
before you start dolg out relationship advice?

749
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,140
-唐娜  -够了
- Donna? - Enough. Enough!

750
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,600
这次会议结束了
Hey, this meeting is over, all right?

751
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,610
天呐  你俩去各自的角落
My God! You two go to your corners,

752
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,280
把嘴上的血都擦干净
wipe the blood off your mouths,

753
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,700
我们稍后再...
and we will revisit-- -

754
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,590
这事今晚就定下来
This gets decided tonight.

755
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,240
我要大家投票  清楚明白
I want a vote, and I want it clean.

756
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:00,000
如果你们都同意唐娜
If you all decide with Donna,

757
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,680
那就自己去上市吧
then you can go ahead and do the IPO without me.

758
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,700
-我辞职  -卡梅伦  别这样
- I quit. - Cameron, come on.

759
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,470
不  我受够了
No! I'm sick of this!

760
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,250
去吧  好好看看这家公司
Go! Take a hard look at this company

761
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,980
问问自己  是谁塑造了它
and ask yourself who made it what it is

762
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,320
又是谁只是搭了顺风车
and who's just been along for the ride!

763
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,910
卡梅伦  别这样
Cameron, please don't do this.

764
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:21,410
你想投票  好啊
You want it? You got it.

765
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,880
但我不会坐视这家公司
But I will not sit by and watch this company die

766
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,130
因为被个任性的孩子挟持而死去
because it's being held hostage by a petulant child.

767
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,120
如果我们不上市
If we don't move forward with the IPO,

768
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,370
你就自己驾船去撞礁石吧
then you can steer this ship into the rocks yourself,

769
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,790
我不干了
because I am outta here.

770
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:37,010
博斯说得对  我们休息下  冷静下来
Okay, Bos is right. Let's take a beat, cool off--

771
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:40,780
举手表决  谁赞成现在上市
Show of hands. Who's in favor of doing the IPO now

772
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,990
不管一切后果
with all that that entails?

773
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,450
你真让我心碎
You're breaking my goddamn heart.

774
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,960
乔
Joe?

775
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,210
你来做什么
What are you doin' here?

776
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,840
总得有人来送钥匙
Someone had to drop off the keys.

777
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,550
欢迎来到你的帝国
Welcome to your empire.

778
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:13,550
参观结束
And thus concludes the grand tour.

779
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,160
好了  注意
All right, pay attention.

780
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,880
这很复杂
This is-- this is complicated.

781
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,580
这个  是大楼钥匙
Okay, this one-- this key's for the building.

782
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:31,780
这个是女厕  这个是男厕
This key is for the ladies' room, for the men's bathroom,

783
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,440
这俩是前门的
and those two are for the front door.

784
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,540
谢谢
Thanks.

785
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:40,620
如果不能是我
If it wasn't gonna be me,

786
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,030
我很高兴会是你
I'm glad it was you.

787
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,160
记得从未来写信给我
Write me from the future.

788
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,360
-49%  -什么
- 49 percent. - What?

789
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,940
来跟我一起经营
Come run it with me...

790
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:55,720
我就给你49%的股份
and 49 percent of the company's yours.

791
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,090
这玩笑好残忍
That's a cruel joke,

792
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:00,060
也不像你的作风
and quite frankly, beneath you.

793
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,370
我是认真的
I'm serious.

794
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:07,630
49%
49 percent.

795
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:21,130
考虑到别人会怎么想  我们得放聪明点
With how this looks, we need to be smart.

796
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:24,650
我该做匿名合伙人
I should be a silent partner.

797
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,130
那更好
Even better.

798
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:46,610
乔
Joe.

799
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:49,470
莱恩  今天对我们很重要
Ryan, today is a big day for us.

800
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,250
你已经见到了
So, you've seen it already?

801
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,270
见到什么
Seen what?

802
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:54,310
那你还不知道
So, then you don't know.

803
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:55,910
我将麦克米伦实用网络的
I released the source code for MacMillan Utility's

804
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,130
杀毒软件源代码公诸于众了
security software to the public.

805
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:00,560
-你说什么呢  -免费了  乔
- What are you talking about? - It's free, Joe.

806
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,360
真真正正的免费了  就像我们想的那样
Really free, like we always wanted.

807
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,220
大家可以修补它  改进它
People can tinker with it, they can make it better--

808
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,330
也可能会把它搞坏
or worse, that can happen, too.

809
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:06,980
但是麦克米伦实用网络
The point is MacMillan Utility

810
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,360
再不能靠它盈利了
can no longer profit off of it.

811
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,040
但这是违法的
But that's illegal.

812
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,310
我还向媒体泄露了
And I released documents to the media

813
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:13,810
能证明麦克米伦实用网络
proving that MacMillan Utility

814
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:17,110
本就支持2.0版收费的文件
was totally on board with charging the public for 2.0 all along,

815
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:19,290
你受攻击是因为你想阻止他们
and they only went after you when you tried to stop them.

816
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:21,760
这能表明他们并不是想保护大家
Yeah, it shows that they weren't trying the protect people

817
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,090
或是保证大家的安全
or-- or keep them safe.

818
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,160
他们只是想利用他们
They were just going to exploit them.

819
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,030
我还向媒体说明
And I laid out for the media

820
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:31,380
你是如何为守护理想而丢了工作
how you lost your job defending your ideals.

821
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,390
你知道你做了什么吗
Do you have any idea what you've done?

822
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:38,970
是的  我如你所愿  还击了他们
Yes! I returned volley just like you wanted.

823
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:41,960
他们要好几年才能缓过来
It's gonna take those bastards years to recover.

824
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:45,190
他们不会放过你的
They are gonna come after you.

825
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:47,330
我不傻  乔
I'm not stupid, Joe.

826
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,360
我完全掩盖了自己的踪迹
I covered every conceivable track.

827
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,720
他们肯定抓不到我  我就那么厉害
They will never catch me. I am that good.

828
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,140
没人那么厉害
Yeah, nobody's that good.

829
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:57,590
我就有
I am.

830
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,350
走着瞧吧
Yeah, we'll see.

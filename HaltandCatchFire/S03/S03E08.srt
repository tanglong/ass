Mr. MacMillan.

00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,310
我们需要问你几个问题
We need to ask you a few questions.

53
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,800
都打包  贴好标签
...pack 'em up and label it.

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,150
你还有别的电脑吗
Do you have any additional computers?

55
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,320
你是说我还买了别的电脑吗  没有
You mean, do I own another computer? No.

56
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,420
我能不能用别的电脑  当然  你也能
Do I have access to other computers? Sure, so do you.

57
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,820
你可以去图书馆
You can go to your library,

58
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,150
可以去你朋友家
you can go to your friend's house--

59
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,450
把你所有曾使用过的
Write down all the locations

60
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,550
电脑的地址写下来
of computers you have access to.

61
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,510
别费劲了  里面什么都没有
Have at it. There's nothing there.

62
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,160
嗯  他们来查我的时候我也这么说的
Yeah, that's what I said when they came for me, too.

63
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,410
这是什么东西
What the hell is that?

64
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,560
小子  没见过数据包嗅探器吗
Oh, kid, you've never seen a packet sniffer?

65
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,420
这就是你最大的敌人
Meet your worst enemy.

66
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,820
你要去哪
Where you going?

67
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,160
我只是
I'm just, um--

68
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,350
我去买些吃的
I'm just gonna go grab a bite to eat.

69
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,570
他们让你别出门
They told you not to leave.

70
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,170
他们接到电话线接口上的玩意到底是什么
What was that thing that they were shoving into the phone jack?

71
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,060
你什么都没做  对吧
You-- you didn't do anything, right?

72
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,990
万一他们回来我怎么说
Hey, what should I tell them if they come back?

73
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,660
什么都别说
Just don't say anything.

74
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,070
再见
Good morning.

75
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,040

They're looking for Ryan.

79
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,470
他  做了件傻事
He, uh-- he did a stupid thing.

80
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,590
他把麦克米伦实用网络的
He-- he released the source code

81
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,580
杀毒软件的源代码发布到网上去了
for MacMillan Utility's anti-virus software online.

82
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,460
-你在逗我吗  -全都发布了
- You've got to be kidding. - All of it.

83
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,560
违反了《计算机欺诈和滥用法案》
It's a violation of the CFAA--

84
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,000
他们以为是你做的
They think you did it.

85
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,280
我知道你要说什么
I know what you're gonna say.

86
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,250
大家都会说一样的话  乔
It's what everyone's gonna say, Joe.

87
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,890
-请你听我说  -别  别说了
- Please, listen. - Stop, stop!

88
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,860
别说了
Stop.

89
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,570
看着我的眼睛
Look me in the eye

90
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,890
告诉我你和代码泄露一点关系都没有
and tell me you had nothing to do with the leak.

91
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,770
我完全不知情
I had nothing to do with it.

92
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,410
那好  那我支持你
All right. Then I'm all in.

93
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,850
我们一起想办法
All right? We'll figure this out together.

94
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,690
穆特尼增长的步伐近来确实略显放慢
While it's true that the pace of Mutiny's growth has slowed somewhat,

95
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,700
但向多平台扩展并不是唯一的出路
multi-platform expansion is not the only solution.

96
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,520
正相反  穆特尼正在实施多项战略
Rather, Mutiny is employing a number of strategies

97
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,730
多管齐下  将使我公司二季度收入大幅上涨
which, taken together, promise a second quarter earnings uptick--

98
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,820
停  你不能这么说
Stop. You can't say that.

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,520
招股书里没有提这些
It's not in the prospectus.

100
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,600
那我总得说点什么吧
Well, I have to say something.

101
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,530
他们能看到用户数量不再增长了
They can see that that user numbers are plateauing.

102
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,800
公司可喜的增长
The company's laudable record of growth

103
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,810
在招股书里都详细记录了
is fully documented in the prospectus.

104
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,240
这听起来好像我在隐瞒什么
That sounds like I'm hiding something.

105
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,610
股票怎么宣传都不为过
You can't hype the stock.

106
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,230
如果我只能念招股书
Well, what's the point of doing this road show

107
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,340
那这样到处奔走还有什么意义
if all I can say is read the prospectus?

108
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,680
为了让他们看招股书
So, they read the prospectus.

109
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,880
我有一些想要说明的内容
Well, there are things that I want to clarify.

110
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,410
招股书应该是一个动态文件
The prospectus should be a living document.

111
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,850
-它不是  -抱歉  证监会有规定
- Well, it's not. - Sorry, SEC rules.

112
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,100
你做得很好了
Look, you're doing great.

113
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,440
我们先见这些小公司的意义就在于
The whole point of coming to these smaller firms first

114
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,660
让你能调整好
is so that you can work out the kinks

115
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,310
再拿去给波士顿和纽约的大公司看
before we take it to the big guns in Boston and New York.

116
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,410
昨晚不是挺顺利的吗
I thought it went pretty well last night, don't you think?

117
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,700
不  我觉得他们不怎么感兴趣
No, I think they were all underwhelmed.

118
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,230
我的感觉就是如此
Hey, I read the room as I see it.

119
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,360
你做得挺好的
You did fine.

120
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,710
幸运的是  丹佛对于科技的投资不多
Fortunately, there isn't much investment capital for tech in Denver.

121
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,110
大家都讨厌这个步骤
Look, everybody hates this process,

122
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,530
但也都能撑过去
and everybody gets through it.

123
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,130
继续吧  讲讲穆特尼创始人卡梅伦·豪伊
So, come on, tell me about Mutiny's founder Cameron Howe.

124
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,110
我知道她已经离开了公司
I understand she's no longer with the company.

125
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,510
卡梅伦是硅谷最有天分的程序员之一
Cameron is one of the most talented coders in Silicon Valley.

126
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,990
她将心血都投给了穆特尼
She gave her heart and soul to Mutiny,

127
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,140
-她的精神依然...  -拜托
- and her spirit is still very much-- - Oh, please!

128
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,470
简直像在给宠物狗念悼词
It sounds like you're eulogizing the family dog.

129
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,750
我们说好这样说的
That's what we agreed I'd say.

130
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,330
听上去不像回事
It doesn't pass the smell test.

131
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,930
那你有更好的主意吗
Do you have a better suggestion?

132
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,860
比如加一点点真实的成分进去
Something with a faint hint of truth to it, maybe?

133
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,440
所以我应该说她是喜怒无常的自恋狂
Oh, so I should say that she's a temperamental narcissist

134
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,930
具有自我毁灭倾向  完全无法合作吗
with self-destructive tendencies who doesn't work with others?

135
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,330
至少你说这话时听起来很可信
Well, at least it sounds like you mean it when you say that.

136
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,790
我很抱歉这话没法说得更好听
I'm sorry that there's no pretty way to talk about this.

137
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,570
但我提醒你  你也投票同意了的
But just a reminder, you voted for it, too.

138
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,410
是同意了  但我记得好像是被迫的吧
Yes, I did, under duress, as I recall.

139
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,460
没人希望如此  事情已经如此了
Nobody wanted it. It's just what happened.

140
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,730
但现在我们还得面对
And yet, here we are.

141
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,910
我只是想帮忙
Look, I'm just trying to help out here.

142
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,890
要不然我出去端咖啡
Unless you just want me to go get the coffee?

143
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,270
你这就要走了
Are you leaving already?

144
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,480
嗯  我觉得我还是等第二周
Yeah, I figured I'd wait till my second week

145
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,160
再开始迟到吧
till I start showing up late.

146
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,490
你能去一下商店吗
Hey, can you, uh, run to the store,

147
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,480
备点糖给来要的小孩
get some candy for the trick or treaters?

148
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,220
卡梅  那些小孩想要糖果
Cam, they're kids, they want candy,

149
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,160
而你该尽量出门走走
and you should try to get out a little bit.

150
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,290
-你能代劳吗  -不行
- Can you do it? - Mmm, no.

151
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,380
-我爱你  -爱你
- I love you. - Love you.

152
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:56,940
那边是优胜场
...Winner's Circle over here.

153
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,620
大钱都在那儿赢
That's where you go to win most of the money,

154
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,760
虽然你坐自己位置上
though you can win some bonus money

155
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,900
也可以赚点小奖
at your chairs over there--

156
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,500
中个一万到两万五美金
10 and $25,000 to crack over there.

157
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,400
这些是今天第一局的主题
These are the subjects in the first game today.

158
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,940
有"水  到处是水"
We've got "Water, Water Everywhere";

159
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,040
"不停来回"  "回想那时"
"Round And Round"; "Remember When";

160
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,550
"将之封存"  "很快归来"
"Keep Them Sealed"; "We'll Be Right Back"--

161
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,990
听着像广告似的
sounds like commercial messages.

162
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,570
我也不懂那是什么  但听着真像广告
I don't know what that is, but that sure sounds like what it is.

163
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,700
"金刚之子"  还有...
"King Kong's Kid"; and we have...

164
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,120
我是莱恩·雷
It's Ryan Ray.

165
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,760
乔和戈登的交易
This deal between Joe and Gordon,

166
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,820
就是扯淡
it's bullshit.

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,020
我才是元老
I was there from the beginning.

168
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,210
没有我那个网络根本不会存在
The network wouldn't exist without me.

169
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:55,860
我比戈登·克拉克强二十倍
And I'm better than Gordon Clark by a magnitude of 20.

170
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,430
戈登想在TCP/IP更新上向思科妥协
Gordon wants to roll over for Cisco on TCP/IP upgrades.

171
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,430
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}传输控制／网际协议

172
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,060
他就是个笑话  毫无远见
It's so short-sighted, he's a joke!

173
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,130
这就是你们的合作伙伴
That's who you're in business with.

174
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,310
我不知道该说什么  米奇
I don't know what to say, Mitch.

175
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,000
抱歉你要这样得知
I'm sorry you had to find out this way.

176
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,830
我投入太多  无法一走了之
I was too invested in this project to just walk away.

177
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,220
听我说  乔  我们喜欢你
Listen, Joe, we like you.

178
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,230
你相信这个网络大有可为
You believed in the network.

179
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,600
你们董事会投票反对我们
Hell, you walked away from your own company

180
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,330
你就离开了自己的公司
when your board voted against us.

181
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,260
可是莱恩  咱们直说吧
But Ryan-- let's face it,

182
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,090
莱恩这家伙可不像会乖乖闭嘴的人
Ryan doesn't sound like a guy who's gonna keep his mouth shut.

183
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,610
可能下一个就打给我老板
His next call could be to my boss.

184
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,980
莱恩绝不会那么做
Ryan would never do that.

185
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,010
不管怎么说  这家伙
Well, regardless, we can't work with someone

186
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,990
现正接受计算机诈骗调查
who's being investigated for computer fraud,

187
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,290
公然触犯了今年生效的重要法案
who blatantly violated major legislation

188
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,720
我们不能跟他合作
that went into effect this year.

189
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,030
乔没做错什么
Joe didn't do anything wrong.

190
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,640
我没说他错了
I'm not saying he did.

191
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,220
但除非我们找到责任人
But until we find the person who is responsible,

192
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,540
你们俩该保持距离
you two need to stay away from each other.

193
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,480
这项网络合同先暂缓
And this network contract is frozen.

194
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,120
莱恩怎么知道我们在合作
How did Ryan know that we were working together?

195
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,720
连我和思科谈判的细节都清楚
Down to the details of my negotiations with Cisco?

196
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,630
他肯定看了我们的电子邮件
He must be reading our emails.

197
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,330
网络是他搭的  他比谁都清楚如何进去
He built the network. He knows how to get inside better than anyone.

198
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,350
我们得告发他
We gotta turn him in.

199
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,750
不行  肯定有别的办法
No, there must be another way.

200
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,370
你在说什么  你没听见那录音吗
What are you talking about? Did you hear the tape?

201
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,270
-合同被暂缓了  -我不能那样对他
- The contract's frozen. - I can't do that to him.

202
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,700
老天爷啊  乔
Oh, Christ, Joe.

203
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,320
他是我朋友
He's my friend.

204
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,330
我以为我是你朋友
I thought I was your friend.

205
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,080
不是吗
No?

206
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,970
好了  天啊  这就来
All right. Jesus, I'm coming.

207
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,610
不给糖就捣乱
Trick or treat!

208
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,510
好几个小时了只有你没扮成公主
You're the first non-princess I've seen for hours.

209
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,980
我讨厌公主
I hate princesses.

210
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,130
我也是
Me, too.

211
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,830
你只有一种糖
You only got one thing.

212
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,090
是啊  不拿就走吧
Yeah. Take it or leave it.

213
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:43,980
阿福
Alf.

214
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,260
赶快
Shoo.

215
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,180
看啊
Well...

216
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,280
一个高个儿孩子扮成了乔·麦克米伦
it's a very tall child dressed as Joe MacMillan.

217
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,920
蝙蝠侠卖光了
Batman was sold out.

218
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,100
我能进去吗
Can I come in?

219
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,040
当然
Yeah.

220
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,350
颜色不错
It's a good color.

221
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,680
还没刷完呢
It's a work in progress.

222
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,310
你找我什么事
So, what's going on?

223
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,720
我想你来不是为了要糖果吧
I assume you're not here for the candy?

224
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,070
我遇到麻烦了
I've got a problem.

225
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,830
你是遇到很多麻烦了吧
It sounds like you got a lot of problems.

226
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,380
除非是真的  不然就没有所谓负面报道
I mean, unless it's true there's no such thing as bad publicity.

227
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:55,850
我...
I'm--

228
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,250
源代码泄露不是我做的
I'm not responsible for the leak.

229
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,920
我想到了
I, yeah, figured.

230
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,190
显然是有真本事的人干的
You know, clearly it was someone with actual skills.

231
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,790
我是说  很明显是莱恩干的
I just mean obviously it was Ryan.

232
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,040
我得找到他  可他失踪了
I need to find him and he's off the grid.

233
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,430
联调局每周都给我打电话
The feds are calling me every week.

234
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,830
肯定的  可能是因为每个线上聊天室
I bet, probably because every chat room online

235
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,940
都认为你是个8位的罗宾汉
thinks you're some kind of 8-bit Robin Hood.

236
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,560
我没强迫莱恩这么做
I didn't make Ryan do this.

237
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,080
我知道
Yeah, I know.

238
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,980
很难强迫莱恩做任何事
It's hard to make Ryan do anything.

239
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,610
你能不能发个信号什么的
If you could send out a kind of flare--

240
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,380
莱恩很有才  但要是有人能追踪到他
I mean, Ryan's talented, but if anyone can track him...

241
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,170
你要把他交给警察吗
Are you gonna turn him in?

242
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,430
不  我是担心他
No, I'm worried about him.

243
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,480
他要走投无路了
He's running out of options.

244
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,280
抱歉
Sorry.

245
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,370
你怎么样
How are you doing?

246
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,930
好得不得了
Never better,

247
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,080
你肯定看得出来
as I'm sure you can see.

248
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,250
看看我们
Well, look at us.

249
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,320
两名被自己公司
Two unemployed CEOs

250
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,350
赶出来的执行总裁
both ousted from our companies.

251
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,330
我的公司死定了  而你的要上市了
Mine's toast and yours is going public.

252
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,630
戈登和我说了
Gordon told me.

253
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,980
好吧
Yeah.

254
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,850
我现在和戈登合作了
I'm working with Gordon now.

255
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,670
真的吗
Really?

256
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,370
真是意外
Now, there's a twist.

257
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,430
你说得对
You were right.

258
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,090
我应该承认他
I needed to give him credit

259
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,980
带上他
and include him,

260
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,190
我对我们共同研发的东西很期待
and we're working on something that I'm really excited about.

261
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,240
所以  谢谢你
So, uh, thank you for that.

262
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,880
好吧
Yeah, well...

263
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,630
谢谢你
thank you.

264
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,640
他啊
Him.

265
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,070
你选的人不错
Well, you picked a good guy.

266
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,620
他很幸运
He's lucky.

267
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,850
不  我觉得我现在只让他觉得痛苦
No, I'm pretty sure right now I'm just making him miserable.

268
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,580
我长大以后就再没见过这玩意了
Oh, I haven't seen one of these since I was a kid.

269
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,200
真吓人
That's scary.

270
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
是啊
Yeah.

271
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,450
因为万圣节  我不得不把它捅了
I had to zap it 'cause of Halloween.

272
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,500
不想让那些小鬼被叮
I didn't want those little wieners getting stung.

273
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,020
如果你帮我找到莱恩  我会很感激
I'd appreciate your help with Ryan.

274
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,900
乔
Hey, Joe.

275
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,400
拿着  不给糖就捣蛋
Here. Trick or treat.

276
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,120
克拉克家
Clark residence.

277
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,700
亲爱的  服装准备得怎么样了
Hi, sweetheart. How's your costume?

278
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,060
挺好的  有点痒
Good. A little itchy.

279
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,700
我的老师说应该把我的矛叫做拐杖
And my teacher said I have to call my spear a walking stick.

280
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,660
为什么
Why?

281
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,790
我不知道  小孩子不该拿矛吗
I don't know. Kids aren't supposed to have spears?

282
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,870
能有想象的矛吗
Well, can they have imaginary spears?

283
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,700
我不知道  我没问
I don't know. I didn't ask that.

284
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,540
那你告诉她
Well, you tell her--

285
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,630
爸爸  妈妈的电话
Daddy, Mommy's on the phone!

286
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,100
海莉  好好玩  亲爱的
Haley? Have the best time, okay, sweetheart?

287
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,360
-怎么样了  -挺好的
- How's it going? - Pretty good.

288
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,150
我觉得我今天表现不错  你那边怎么样
I think I did all right today. How are things over there?

289
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,900
很好  一切都很好
Great. Everything's great.

290
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,430
-不  辫子  -是琼妮吗  我能和她说话吗
- No, a braid. - Is that Joanie? Can I talk to her?

291
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,940
妈妈想和你说话
Hey, Mom wants to talk to you.

292
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,280
编头发的时候不行  会偏的
Not while you're braiding. It'll be all lopsided.

293
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,520
-好吧  -没关系
- All right. - That's okay.

294
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,930
让她玩得开心点  好吗
Just tell her to have fun, all right?

295
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,060
她要扮成谁
What's she going as?

296
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,440
琼·蒙大纳
Joan Montana.

297
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,000
记得拍照  好吗
Take pictures, okay?

298
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,580
好的
Will do.

299
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,160
戈登  我好想你
Gordon, I-- I miss you.

300
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,790
我也想你
Yep, miss you, too.

301
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,370
快点  爸爸
Hurry up, Daddy.

302
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,400
两个孩子  一场大戏
Two kids, three-ring circus.

303
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,250
海莉就像个小检察官
Haley's like a tiny prosecutor.

304
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,460
她一直跑来给我们看她姐姐捣乱的证据
She kept coming down here to offer evidence against her sister.

305
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,830
琼妮太吓人  我不敢定她罪
Yeah, Joanie's too scary to convict.

306
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,340
青少年的她渐渐要冒头了
Her teenage self is lurking on the horizon

307
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,820
就像后天启时代的破坏者
like some post-apocalyptic ravager.

308
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,830
破坏者
Ravager, huh?

309
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,570
你根本无法想象
You have no idea.

310
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,600
你有些消息了吧
So, um, I was hoping you had heard some news.

311
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,490
他没来消息
I haven't heard from him.

312
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,570
我能问你件事吗
Can I ask you a question?

313
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,940
你...
Were--

314
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,490
你和莱恩
were you and Ryan, um,

315
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,570
有过...你懂的
ever, uh... you know.

316
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,420
什么
What?

317
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,740
你...
Um, did you...

318
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,990
就那个
you know...?

319
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,070
懂吗
You know?

320
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,490
什么
What?

321
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,260
你懂的  你...
You know, were--

322
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,560
你们...
were you, you know,

323
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,560
不止是朋友吧
more than... friends?

324
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,610
明白吧
You know?

325
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,850
我对莱恩没有那种感觉
I never had those feelings for Ryan.

326
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,170
其实吧
Actually,

327
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,010
他让我想起你
he kind of reminds me of you.

328
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,330
拜托  请别这么说
Oh, come on, please don't say that.

329
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,870
我不知道该怎么回了
That's-- I don't know how to respond to that.

330
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,110
别整我了
Stop messing with me.

331
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,380
你应该独自继续国家科学基金网的项目
You should move forward with the NSFNET project alone.

332
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,770
什么  你什么意思
Wh-what? What are you talking about?

333
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,870
我不想拖你后腿
I don't want to hold you back.

334
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,000
你没拖我后腿  你在帮我
You're not holding me back. You're helping me.

335
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,780
戈登  米奇说得很清楚
Gordon, Mitch was pretty clear about this.

336
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,020
-乔  请别这样  -你也知道这种事
- Joe, please don't do this. - You know how these things work.

337
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,290
-如果你错过机会  -我一个人干不来
- If you miss the window-- - I can't do it alone.

338
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,790
你可以  不要妄自菲薄
Yes, you can. Don't sell yourself short.

339
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,810
我病了  乔
I'm sick, Joe.

340
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,580
-我病了  -什么意思
- I'm sick. - What-- what the hell does that mean?

341
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,880
我马上回来
Hang on real quick.

342
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,840
-戈登  -等等  我得接一下
- Gordon? - Hang on, I gotta get this.

343
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,630
-别管了  -可能是唐娜
- Leave it. - Look, it could be Donna.

344
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,930
给我两秒钟
Just give me two secs.

345
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,910
喂
Hello?

346
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,160
现在  不  我得照顾孩子  我...
Now? No, I got the kids. I--

347
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,030
好吧  我会想办法的
All right, look, I'll-- I'll figure something out.

348
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,380
好
Yep.

349
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:45,900
好
Yep.

350
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,850
是穆特尼  他们要我...算了
That was Mutiny. They need me to-- it doesn't--

351
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,030
我们得谈谈
we need to talk, all right?

352
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,250
但现在我需要你帮我个忙
But right now I need a favor from you.

353
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,030
除非你告诉我怎么回事  否则哪也别想去
You're not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on.

354
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,120
-不行  我得去...  -坐下
- Look, I can't. I gotta go-- - Sit down.

355
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,660
坐
Sit.

356
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,190
莱恩
Ryan.

357
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,670
莱恩  莱恩
Ryan. Ryan!

358
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,100
你怎么找到我的
How'd you find me?

359
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,820
我在穆特尼建了"你安全吗"版块
I put up the "Are You Safe" board on Mutiny.

360
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,530
你通过FTP链接远程登录
You logged in remotely through an FTP connection--

361
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,230
你写了个软件陷阱
You wrote a software trap

362
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,360
向你报告我的活动  包括大学主线
alerting you to my activity, including the university mainlines.

363
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,040
我早该想到的
I should have thought about that.

364
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,190
我不是来抓你什么的
Hey, I'm not here to bust you or anything.

365
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,650
乔想帮你
Joe wants to help you.

366
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,970
我想帮你
I-- I want to help you.

367
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,930
你
Hey, you--

368
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,270
莱安  你不可能靠胡椒博士和奶酪饼干过一辈子
Ryan, you can't live off Dr Pepper and Cheez-Its forever.

369
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,730
相信我  我试过的
Believe me, I've tried.

370
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,000
你都去哪了
Where have you been?

371
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,510
我在朋友家借宿了一段时间
I crashed with friends for a while.

372
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,320
警察一直在找我
The cops, they keep tracking me.

373
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,170
你怎么知道
Uh, how did you know?

374
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,500
我能感觉到
I could feel it.

375
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,990
有人跟踪了我
Somebody was following me.

376
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,660
我的朋友
And-- and my buddy,

377
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,080
经常接到奇怪的来电
he kept getting these weird phone calls.

378
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,120
是吗
Yeah.

379
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,560
后来
And, um,

380
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,950
我搭大巴去了圣地亚哥
I took the bus down to San Diego

381
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,040
住在了亲戚家
and, um, stayed with my cousin.

382
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,730
他很崇拜搞技术的  也是个混蛋
He's a wannabe tech guy and a total asshole.

383
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,720
他说他不会把我供出去  但是我...
He said he wouldn't rat me out, but I--

384
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,970
我知道他会的
I knew he would, you know?

385
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,090
我搭车回到了旧金山
I hitched a ride back to SF.

386
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,060
我需要一杯咖啡和一台电脑  所以
I needed a cup of coffee and a computer, so...

387
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,930
我就混了进来
I blended in right here.

388
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,750
就像隐形人一样
It's like I'm invisible.

389
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,010
乔现在可能恨死我了
Joe probably hates me now.

390
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,190
不
Oh, no.

391
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,730
不  即使他真生气
No, and even if he is pissed,

392
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,910
也会原谅你的
he'll get over it.

393
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,120
乔有时候...
Joe can be...

394
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,890
会惊人的宽容
surprisingly forgiving.

395
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,060
也许是因为他已经毁了太多次自己的生活
Maybe it's because he's screwed up his own life so many times.

396
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,840
如果你不希望我告诉他你在哪  我不会说的
Hey, if you don't want me to tell him where you are, I won't.

397
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:40,190
但他真的就是想帮你考虑下出路
But he really just wants to walk you through your options.

398
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,540
他很担心你
He's worried about you.

399
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,460
你看
And look,

400
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,370
我找到你了
I found you,

401
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,030
所以...你躲不了一世
so... you can't hide forever.

402
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,220
我还以为你会把丫头们带来呢
I thought you were gonna bring the girlies along.

403
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,640
不
No.

404
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,700
找到个很棒的新保姆
Found a great new sitter.

405
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,940
特别好说话
Really flexible.

406
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,220
谢谢你帮忙
Well, thanks for bailing me out.

407
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,890
我不希望唐娜在这节骨眼上还要担心别的事
I didn't want to worry Donna on the eve of her big day.

408
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:16,930
好吧
Yeah.

409
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,050
你要拿你公开募股的股份怎么办
What you gonna do with your share of the IPO?

410
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,690
我不知道
I don't know.

411
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,860
我觉得我应该做点打算
I guess I should make some plans.

412
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,120
他们说会是15美元起价
You know, they're saying it's gonna open at 15.

413
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,440
15美元
15.

414
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,460
谁能想到
Who'd have thunk it?

415
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,260
你打算拿你的股份怎么办
What are you gonna do with your share?

416
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,160
一部分给我的孙子做
Stash away some for a college fund type of thing

417
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,650
大学基金之类的
for my grandson.

418
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,180
如果詹姆斯同意的话
That is, if that's all right with James.

419
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,870
是吗  他为什么会不同意
Yeah? Why wouldn't it be?

420
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,210
谁知道什么会惹到他呢
You never know what might hit a nerve.

421
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,630
好吧
All right.

422
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,530
你和卡梅聊过了吗
You talk to Cam?

423
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:58,790
没有
No.

424
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,610
你呢
You?

425
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,620
没有
Nope.

426
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,300
但是
But...

427
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,660
她明天就是百万富翁了
she'll be a millionaire tomorrow.

428
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,450
她肯定不会为此难过的
She can't be too sorry about that.

429
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,950
-敬上市  -敬上市
- Hey, here's to going public. - To going public.

430
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,500
当然了  谢谢
Yeah, you bet. Thanks so much.

431
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,570
不客气
No problem.

432
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,500
看看你
Well, look at you.

433
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,180
在前门等我
Waiting for me at the front door.

434
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:29,750
我们离终生梦想只差一条围裙了
We're one apron away from a lifelong fantasy.

435
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,680
我有个提议
I have a proposition for you.

436
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,390
我能先给你看点东西吗
Can I show you something first?

437
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,010
-好的  -好
- Yeah. - Okay, good.

438
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,800
-好  -好
- Okay. - Okay.

439
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,620
这叫《太空摩托编年史》
It's called the "Spacebike Chronicles."

440
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,730
-好  -这是主人公
- Okay. - This is our hero.

441
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,780
她还没有名字
She doesn't have a name.

442
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:58,450
她在天启后的未来里畅游
And she's just cruising through the post-apocalyptic future

443
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,820
骑着她酷炫的太空摩托
on her bad-ass space-bike.

444
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,890
她只需要汽油  糖果
And all she needs survive are gas, candy,

445
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,100
和偶尔洗个热水澡就能生存
and the occasional long, hot shower.

446
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,190
她前往行星  小行星  太空站
So, she travels to planets and asteroids and space stations

447
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,680
搜集她需要的东西
trying to get what she needs.

448
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,900
当她来到新的地方
And when she arrives at a new place,

449
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,130
她会去努力赢得五感之一
she tries to win one of the five senses.

450
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,940
每一感都能给她新的能力
Each one arms her with a different power.

451
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,780
分寸感让她可以改变大小
A sense of proportion allows her to change size.

452
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:26,980
幽默感让她可以抵御大部分袭击
A sense of humor allows her to fend off most forms of attack.

453
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,270
自我感让她可以显现消失
A sense of self allows her to appear and disappear.

454
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,380
正派并不能给她能力
Okay, well, decency doesn't give her an actual power,

455
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,880
但让她可以
but it makes it possible

456
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,650
赢得最罕见的一感
for her to win the rarest sense of all--

457
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,320
常识
common sense,

458
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,250
这能让她更清楚地看透一切
which lets her see everything more clearly.

459
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,600
太美妙了
It's beautiful.

460
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,300
怎么赢
How do you win?

461
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,680
不会赢  你可以一直玩下去
You don't, you just get to keep playing.

462
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,420
我喜欢
I love it.

463
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,660
来  过来
Come here. Come here, come up.

464
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:15,030
你想听一个提议吗
Do you want to hear, uh, the proposition?

465
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,610
你想搬去日本吗
How do you feel about moving to Japan?

466
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,150
什么
What?

467
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,580
他们要给我升职
They want to move me up.

468
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,700
派去东京
All the way to Tokyo.

469
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,070
太棒了
That's perfect.

470
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,610
-真的吗  -嗯
- Really? - Yeah.

471
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:07,880
莱恩
Ryan?

472
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,460
你为什么对我撒谎
Why'd you lie to me?

473
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,930
你为什么把我踢出去
Why'd you cut me out?

474
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,550
我没那么做
I didn't do either of those things.

475
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,560
-我是打算带上你的  -带上我
- I planned to bring you in. - Bring me in?

476
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,450
是我创造了它
I created the whole thing.

477
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,340
是我放出了代码
I put the code out there,

478
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,310
让它真正免费了
really made it free

479
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,630
而你没有胆这么做
when you didn't have the guts to do it yourself.

480
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,510
此后我一直在外面  维护你的名声
And I've been out there ever since, defending your name,

481
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,560
讲出真相
telling the real story.

482
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,090
我一直很担心你
I've been worried about you.

483
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,000
来坐下
Hey, sit down.

484
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,470
我知道你生气了  承认吧
I know you're angry, just admit it.

485
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,640
我没有
I'm not.

486
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,550
我确实希望你没有搅黄国家科学基金网的交易
I wish you hadn't upset the NSFNET deal.

487
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:51,050
你的确让事情难办多了
You've made things much harder.

488
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,740
但这远不如
But that is less important

489
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,830
你没事要紧
than knowing that you're okay.

490
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,000
在我看来
As I see it,

491
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,440
你有两个选择
you've got two options.

492
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,960
你可以自首  承认你做了什么
You can turn yourself in and own up to what you did...

493
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,810
或者你可以逃
or you can run.

494
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,270
不管怎样
Either way,

495
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,490
我都会帮你
I will help you.

496
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,680
怎么帮
How?

497
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,900
如果你逃
If you run,

498
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,900
我会给你五万块  送你去大巴站
I'll give you 50 grand, drive you to the bus station

499
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,530
你可以就此消失
and you can disappear.

500
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,470
但我们创立的网络
But the network you and I created

501
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,370
也会消失
will disappear, too.

502
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:39,240
不  我不希望那样
No, I don't want that.

503
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,610
我找过我的律师
I put in a call to my lawyer.

504
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,480
如果你自首
If you turn yourself in,

505
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,890
至多也就蹲一两年
you'll serve no more than a year or two.

506
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,030
不  我做不到
No, I can't.

507
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,150
听我说
Listen to me.

508
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:56,570
触犯《计算机欺诈和滥用法》的黑客
A hacker that violates the CFAA

509
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,800
至少五年不能碰电脑
can't touch a computer for at least five years--

510
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,940
五年  那简直疯了
Five years? That's insane!

511
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,810
这根本不是个选择
And that's an impossible choice!

512
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,590
总比蹲10年监狱强
It's better than 10 years in prison.

513
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,090
那是最高刑罚
That's the maximum.

514
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,480
我知道听上去好像很久
I know it sounds like a long time,

515
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,180
但你还年轻  就像你对我说的
but you're young, and it's like you told me,

516
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,350
毁灭带来改变
destruction leads to transformation.

517
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,360
你还有大把时间重塑自己
You've got plenty of time to reinvent yourself.

518
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:21,550
是啊  我就想这么办
Yeah, that's what I want to do.

519
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,760
跟你一起重新开始  就像你当初雇我时那样
Start again with you, like when you first hired me.

520
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,580
我们在这里开工  创造东西
We sat right here making shit up,

521
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,680
在白板上写下点子
writing ideas on the board.

522
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,380
好吧  好
Okay, all right.

523
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,030
好吧
Fine.

524
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,530
如果我
Let's say I--

525
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,630
我照你说的做
I do what you say

526
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,440
我服刑
and I serve my time.

527
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,370
我们还能一起工作吗
Tell me we can still work together.

528
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,990
那不可能
That's not possible.

529
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,130
但换你也会这么做的
But you would have done the same thing.

530
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,290
你就是干这种事的大师
You're a master at this kind of move.

531
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,040
乔·麦克米伦的典型作风
It's classic Joe MacMillan.

532
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,470
我不能再跟乔·麦克米伦一起工作了
I can't work with Joe MacMillan anymore.

533
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,310
好吧
Fine.

534
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,620
不管你帮不帮  我都要这么做
I'll do this with or without you.

535
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,840
我希望你成功
I hope you do.

536
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,790
你是个伪君子  一直都是
You're a hypocrite and you always have been.

537
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,290
你不用今晚决定
You don't have to decide tonight.

538
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,670
我希望你睡这儿
I want you to sleep here

539
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,330
我们可以早上再谈
and we can talk more in the morning.

540
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,450
你需要休息  莱恩
But you need some rest, Ryan.

541
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,770
我去拿床单  把沙发布置一下
I'll get some sheets and we can make up the sofa.

542
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,130
女士要我放在哪
Where would madam like the tray?

543
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,130
摆在床上吧
Oh, uh, on the bed, please.

544
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,050
还需要别的吗
Will there be anything else?

545
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,520
不了  谢谢
No, thank you.

546
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,090
唐娜
Donna?

547
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,190
你睡得如何
How'd you sleep?

548
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,040
不好  但我不在意
Oh, horribly, but I didn't really mind.

549
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,660
床单太舒服了
The sheets were so comfortable.

550
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,540
你吃过早餐了吗
Have you eaten breakfast?

551
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,590
不不  我紧张时不吃早餐
Oh, no, no. I don't do breakfast when I'm nervous.

552
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,870
我吃
I do.

553
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:01,940
我要上电视
I'm gonna be on TV

554
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,110
然后我的公司就要上市了
and then my company's going public.

555
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,390
你会表现很好的
You're gonna be great.

556
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,920
你总那么说
You always say that.

557
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,020
你就是很棒
No, you are.

558
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,070
你会很棒的
You're gonna be great.

559
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,530
好像对面是个人一样直视它
So, just look directly into it like it's a person.

560
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,080
琳达能看到你
Lynda will be able to see you.

561
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,990
她的声音会从耳机中传过来
Her voice will come into your earpiece.

562
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,830
会稍有声音延迟
There will be a bit of a sound delay.

563
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,080
有问题吗
Any questions?

564
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,570
还有五分钟
Five away.

565
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,250
好了  走吧
All right, come on, guys.

566
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,010
我想回床上去
I wanna go back to bed.

567
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,410
我知道  但我们得起来看妈妈
I know, but we gotta get up and watch Mommy.

568
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,200
好吗  今天是她的大日子
All right? It's her big day.

569
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,630
我待会儿就给你们
I'll make you guys some breakfast

570
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,320
做早餐  好吗
in just a little bit, okay?

571
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,660
好了  你们去沙发上吧
All right, you guys get on the couch.

572
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,980
来  起来
Come on, hop up.

573
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,400
给爸爸腾点地方
Gotta make some room for Daddy.

574
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,890
欢迎继续收看《财经早间报道》
Welcome back to "Financial Watch AM."

00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,040
今早我们请来了唐娜·克拉克
This morning we have with us Donna Clark,

576
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,760
穆特尼执行总裁
CEO of Mutiny,

577
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:19,160
网上购物这个勇敢新世界的开拓者
a trailblazer in the brave new world of online shopping.

578
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,930
-欢迎  唐娜  -看  是妈妈
- Welcome, Donna. - Look, it's Mommy.

579
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,890
正是由于我们本期嘉宾这样的人
Thanks to people like our guest,

580
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,500
2.5千万拥有
for the 25 million Americans

581
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,280
私人电脑的美国人
who own personal computers,

582
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,370
可以靠键盘完成圣诞节购物
Christmas shopping is just a keystroke away.

583
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,480
-唐娜  -她看上去好美
- So, Donna... - She looks so pretty.

584
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,830
作为创建了科技公司的女人
a woman who founded a tech company.

585
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,230
你很不寻常  是吧
You're something of an anomaly, aren't you?

586
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,270
其实  穆特尼是由我的前合伙人
Well, actually, Mutiny was founded by my former partner,

587
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,180
卡梅伦·豪伊创立
Cameron Howe.

588
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,000
这样啊  他在哪呢
Ah, I see. And where is he?

589
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,680
是她  已经退出公司了
Uh, she is no longer with the company.

590
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,670
那么公司的确是由女人创建的
So, it was founded by a woman?

591
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:47,950
是的
Yes.

592
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,920
跟我们讲讲
So, how does it work,

593
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,250
这新电子零售的现象吧
this new e-tail phenomenon?

594
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,380
其实非常简单
It's very simple, really.

595
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:58,270
大部分家用电脑都是与调制解调器相连的
Most home computers are connected to something called a modem.

596
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,820
这个装置是...
That's a device which uses--

597
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,160
天呐  这听上去很复杂
Oh, dear, it's sounding complicated.

598
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:03,940
并不的
It isn't, really--

599
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,890
总之  我能用它买鞋吗
Bottom line-- can I buy my shoes with it?

600
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,430
当然了
Yes, absolutely.

601
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:12,120
我们在与多个零售商合作
We're in partnership with several retailers and--

602
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:16,230
终于有一件让人激动的电脑新闻了
Finally, something about computers to get excited about.

603
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,370
我究竟要怎么买鞋
So, how exactly would I buy my shoes?

604
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,090
登录穆特尼  在家...
Well, you would log on to Mutiny and from the home--

605
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,370
我们拦截了电话线的股票行情自动收录器信号
We intercepted the ticker feed from phone lines.

606
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,640
去往一间银行的
Going into a bank.

607
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,480
然后改道接入了办公室调制解调器
And then rerouted to the office modem.

608
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,280
-嗯  -听上去完全不合法嘛
- Yeah. - Well, that sounds entirely legal.

609
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,150
是啊
Sure.

610
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:35,530
好了  我声明  我对此计划并不知情
Okay, for the record I had no prior knowledge of this plan.

611
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,030
该死
Shit.

612
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,500
拜托  太没经验了
Oh, come on. Rookie move, son.

613
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,290
这是什么  帆船
What are you doing? Sailboat?

614
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,540
没挣到钱先别急着花啊
Don't spend your money before you've made it.

615
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,150
真白痴
What a dweeb!

616
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,830
好了  今天上市的公司会先出来
Okay, look. So, the companies debuting today come out first.

617
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,140
有多少
How many are there?

618
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,590
我不知道
I don't know.

619
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,960
-来了  来了  -看啊
- Oh, here we go. Here we go. - Hey, look at that.

620
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:55,590
钱  钱  钱
Money, money, money.

621
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,550
开始了
Okay, here we go.

622
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,950
好吧  比我们预期的低了一点
Okay, it's a little lower than we expected.

623
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,090
别紧张
Just breathe.

624
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,530
我们能给妈妈打电话了吗
Can we call Mommy yet?

625
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,960
我们恐怕得等等了
Uh, I think we're gonna wait a little.

626
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,900
你想知道吗
Do you wanna know?

627
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:26,480
告诉我是好是坏
Just... tell me if it's good or bad.

628
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,400
我知道这是个打击
I know it's a morale blow.

629
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,320
我知道
I get it.

630
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,150
但这不代表股票没有价值
But it doesn't mean that the stock is worthless.

631
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,270
只是不如我们想的值钱
It's just not worth what we thought.

632
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,500
可能是因为我们增长的速度
It could be the pace of our growth.

633
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,010
可能是因为受限于康懋达
It could be a Commodore issue.

634
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,900
他们这一季的销量很差
They had a horrible quarter.

635
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,310
或是时间问题  因素有很多...
Or just a calendar thing. There are all sorts of schools of--

636
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:04,470
能让我单独待会儿吗
Can I, um-- can I have a minute?

637
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,530
麦克米伦先生  我们得进去
Mr. MacMillan, we need to come in.

638
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,520
什么事
What's this about?

639
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,190
莱恩·雷昨晚在你公寓吗
Was Ryan Ray in your apartment last night?

640
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,040
是的
Yeah.

641
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,700
但他已经走了
But he's gone now.

642
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,750
我不知道他在哪
I don't know where he is.

643
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,380
先生  你坐下吧
Sir, why don't you sit down?

644
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,880
乔
Look, Joe,

645
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,900
你还要读多少遍啊
how many times are you going to read that?

646
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,190
他就是在这儿写的
He wrote it right here

647
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,650
趁我睡觉的时候
while I was sleeping.

648
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,360
我不能拿它挣钱
I can't profit from this.

649
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,780
不行
No.

650
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,830
不  这是你的点子
No, it was your idea.

651
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,190
好吗  我会等你的
Okay? I'll-- I'll wait for you.

652
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,400
我会想办法拖拖
You know? I'll see if I can stall things.

653
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:17,570
你不该想跟我共事
Yeah, you shouldn't want to work with me.

654
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,420
那晚上我
The night I was--

655
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,580
跟莱恩站在外面
stood out there with Ryan,

656
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,160
我们还说...
we talked about...

657
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,140
天呐  我不知道我都说了什么
God, I don't know what I was saying.

658
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,230
那不是
Look, that's--

659
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,820
他那么做的原因
that's not why.

660
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,020
老天啊
Jesus Christ.

661
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,850
我是想帮他
I was trying to help him.

662
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,710
你要怎么办
What are you gonna do?

663
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,480
我不知道
I don't know.

664
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,340
我不能总这样
I can't keep having this conversation.

665
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:02,980
我不干了
I'm done.

666
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,390
戈登
Hey, Gordon.

667
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,980
对不起
I'm sorry.

668
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,410
你真的不想推迟吗
Are you sure you don't want to postpone?

669
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,840
不知道会不会举办葬礼
I don't know if there's a funeral.

670
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,090
不  我们走吧
No, let's go.

671
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,430
真的吗  我们可以改航班的
Are you sure? 'Cause we can change our flight.

672
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,920
汤姆  我没事
Tom, I'm fine.

673
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,310
好吗
Okay?

674
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,940
我准备好离开这儿了
I'm ready to leave this place.

675
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,050
那个
You know...

676
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,100
天呐  或许
God, maybe...

677
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,700
有些东西在日本没有
there will be some things that they won't have in Japan.

678
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:45,630
是吗
Yeah?

679
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:49,280
嗯  或许我该去趟商店
Yeah, maybe I should go to the store and just...

680
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:52,780
确保我们拿上
make sure that we have

681
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,830
需要的一切
everything we need.

682
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,060
当然  好主意
Yeah, of course. Good idea.

683
00:42:58,810 --> 00:42:59,890
要我陪你去吗
You want me to go with you?

684
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,140
不用  我去
No, I'll go.

685
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,910
好
Okay.

686
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,670
我  莱恩·雷
"I, Ryan Ray,

687
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,010
泄露了麦克米伦实用网络的源代码
released the MacMillan Utility source code.

688
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:13,930
我是一人行事
I acted alone.

689
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,590
没人帮我  没人教唆我
No one helped me, and no one told me to do it.

690
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,780
我这么做是因为"安全"只是个传说
I did this because 'security' is a myth.

691
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:24,250
与你们所听到的不同  朋友们
Contrary to what you might have heard, my friends,

692
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:26,700
你们不安全
you are not safe.

693
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,340
安全是个故事
Safety is a story.

694
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,430
我们把它告诉孩子们
It's something we teach our children

695
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,260
好让他们夜晚能够入睡
so they can sleep at night,

696
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,540
但我们知道那不是真的
but we know it's not real.

697
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,570
小心  困惑的人类
Beware, baffled humans.

698
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:45,400
小心向你兜售假未来的伪先知
Beware of false prophets who will sell you a fake future,

699
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,960
小心坏老师  腐败的领袖
of bad teachers, corrupt leaders

700
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,790
和肮脏的公司
and dirty corporations.

701
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,570
小心警察  抢劫犯
Beware of cops and robbers...

702
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,170
抢走你的梦想的抢劫犯
the kind that rob your dreams.

703
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:00,830
但最重要的
But most of all,

704
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,500
小心彼此
beware of each other,

705
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:06,600
因为一切都将改变
because everything's about to change.

706
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,460
世界会碎裂开来
The world is going to crack wide open.

707
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,240
有东西即将到来
There's something on the horizon.

708
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,650
广泛的连接
A massive connectivity.

709
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,340
我们之间的屏障将消失
The barriers between us will disappear,

710
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,390
我们还没准备好
and we're not ready.

711
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,900
我们将以新的方式伤害彼此
We'll hurt each other in new ways.

712
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,200
我们将出售  被卖
We'll sell and be sold.

713
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:31,590
我们将暴露最温柔的自己
We'll expose our most tender selves,

714
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:34,050
但只会被嘲笑  毁灭
only to be mocked and destroyed.

715
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,420
我们将如此脆弱
We'll be so vulnerable,

716
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,000
并为此付出代价
and we'll pay the price.

717
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,870
我们将无法假装
We won't be able to pretend

718
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:44,180
我们还能保护自己
that we can protect ourselves anymore.

719
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:48,480
这很危险
It's a huge danger,

720
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,710
很冒险
a gigantic risk,

721
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:52,680
但是值得的
but it's worth it.

722
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:56,610
如果我们能学会照顾彼此就好
If only we can learn to take care of each other.

723
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,700
那么这了不起的  毁灭性的新连接
Then this awesome, destructive new connection

724
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,190
将不会隔离我们
won't isolate us.

725
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,860
不会最终让我们
It won't leave us in the end so...

726
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:07,130
完全孤独
totally alone.

高级合伙人
senior partner.

56
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,020
我的天  这头衔真气派  是不是
My God, that does have a ring to it, doesn't it?

57
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,480
给
Here.

58
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,350
我本来喜欢红发妹的  但是天啊
You know I like redheads, but my God,

59
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,760
那新来的前台妹子真牛脾气
that new girl at reception got a real attitude.

60
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,320
-她逼你登记了吗  -可不是呢
- She make you sign in? - Well, she damn well did.

61
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,380
抱歉我错过了庆典
Hey, I'm sorry I missed the celebration.

62
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,290
圣胡安那边大风大雨的
We had a big storm down in the San Juans.

63
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,100
想不到你还是会欣赏万宝龙的人
I never pegged you for a Montblanc kind of guy.

64
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,030
其实没有  我就是挑了个包装好的
Well, I ain't. I thought it would go with the decor.

65
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,100
上面还有那朵小雪花
Also got that nice little snowflake thing right on top.

66
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,870
-多谢  博斯  -客气
- Thanks, Bos. - Sure.

67
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,150
我的天
Jeez.

68
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,740
你要不多待会儿
Hey, you wanna stick around?

69
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,650
下去喝杯咖啡什么的
Maybe got downstairs, get a cup of coffee, or--?

70
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,530
我倒是想  但是
Oh, I would love to, but, uh...

71
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,280
我还得赶路
I gotta hit the road.

72
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,560
黛安已经到葡萄园了
Diane's already up at the Vineyard.

73
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,340
总之
Look, anyway,

74
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,320
恭喜你
congrats.

75
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,020
话说  你去今年的计算机分销商展览吗
Oh, say. Are you going to Comdex this year?

76
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,500
去不了  我今年太忙了
Uh... no. Too much work this year.

77
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,830
现在都闹哄哄的  不像以前了
Oh, you know, it's a circus now. Not like it used to be.

78
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,340
费事不值得
It's more trouble than it's worth.

79
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,740
好吧
Well...

80
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,360
我可跟你说  那是好酒
All right. Hey, now, that's the good stuff.

81
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,790
别忘了  嗨就嗨翻天
Remember, respect the dirty bird

82
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,260
就怕玩闷的
or fear the kickin' chicken.

83
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,300
"玩闷的"
"Kickin' chicken"?

84
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,920
早安  雷
Morning, Ray.

Amgen's a yes, put it on the tape.

86
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,490

Yeah, I'm not interested, Ray.

87
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,670

91
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,060

93
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,870
你对泛林半导体怎么看
What's your position on Lam Research?

94
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,920
好吧  签限价单
All right, set up a limit order.

95
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,100
没兴趣  你知道我重视电信业
I'm not interested. You know I'm long on telecom.

96
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,360
就这样
That's all.

97
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,900
我们只是更希望
Look, we'd just prefer

98
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,960
能由你亲自来  哪怕只是一晚
if it was you coming out, even for one night.

99
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,570
两位  你们不用担心
Guys, you're in great hands.

100
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,450
伊莱亚斯会确保卡米诺电子在展会上大放光彩
Elias will make sure that CaminoWare is the talk of Comdex.

101
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,130
-等等  -而且等你们回到圣何塞
- Wait, wait, wait-- - And by the time you're back in San Jose,

102
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,570
我就已经准备好给你们B轮融资了
I'll have the table set for your Series B financing.

103
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,980
怎么样
How does that sound?

104
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,940
很好
All right.

105
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,940
那我们该去收拾了
Well, we should go pack.

106
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,430
对
Yeah.

107
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,990
对了
Yeah, yeah.

108
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,720
天啊  两位  你们的酒我请了
Oh, Jesus, guys, I've got your Heinekens.

109
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,810
回头到了展会上可别这么露怯
Whatever you do, don't do that at Comdex.

110
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,350
那好  谢谢
Okay, thanks.

111
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,750
实在是谢谢您了
It was really sweet of you.

112
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,240
唐娜  这块你是专家  你帮我论论理
Hey, Donna. This is your area of expertise. Settle a bet for me.

113
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,310
这哥们认为政府
This fellow thinks the feds

114
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,120
会在91年前放开对国家科学基金网的管制
are gonna deregulate all of NSFNET by '91.

115
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,660
戈登·克拉克  这位是
Gordon Clark, this here is--

116
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,270
唐娜  唐娜·埃默森
Donna. Donna Emerson.

117
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,970
幸会
Nice to meet you.

118
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,390
我刚说  就联邦政府那德性
Yeah, so I said the goddamn federal government

119
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,740
我订本《花花公子》
can't even deliver my Playboys

120
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,920
都隔三差五被不知哪个变态偷走
without some creep swiping them every other month.

121
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,240
最早也得93年了
'93 at the earliest.

122
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,000
有个田纳西州参议员
Well, there's a senator in Tennessee.

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,030
他在这事上很是执着
He's a real dog with a bone on this thing.

124
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,020
-看来你很自信嘛  -是的
- Oh, you seem really sure of yourself. - I am.

125
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,210
而且跟你说  长久以来  我也不自信
And you know, for a long time I wasn't.

126
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:36,240
然后突然间  我肩上的担子就减轻了
and then this... weight was suddenly lifted off of me.

127
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,170
什么样的担子啊
What kind of weight exactly?

128
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,330
就好像有人
Like someone poured cement

129
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,680
往保龄球里灌了水泥
in a bunch of bowling balls

130
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,830
然后把这些保龄球绑在了
and then strapped those bowling balls

131
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,280
一个胖杂技演员身上
onto a big fat circus man

132
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,960
然后这个演员爬上了一个梯子
and then he climbed this ladder...

133
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,050
-然后站在了你肩膀上  -你懂的
- And then stood on your shoulders? - You get it.

134
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,150
确实  我也才摆脱了自己的负担
I do! I cut loose a ball and chain of my own recently.

135
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,770
感觉无比解脱
Very liberating.

136
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,880
那现在呢  都是一夜情和大都市鸡尾酒了吗
So, what now? Just casual sex and cosmos?

137
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,400
一夜情和马蒂尼
Casual sex and martinis.

138
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,210
但是一夜情听起来太无聊懒散
Oh, but "Casual" makes it sound boring, lazy.

139
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,500
我觉得一夜激情更贴切点
I'd rather go with "Hot and dirty" sex.

140
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,620
说到这个  你今天有安排了吗
Speaking of, what are you doing later?

141
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,030
有约了  抱歉
Hot date, sorry.

142
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,010
我们的赌稍后再说吧
We'll settle the bet later.

143
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,180
再好不过
Yes, we will.

144
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,070
那是谁啊
Who was that?

145
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,510
不认识
I don't know.

146
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,650
那么  恭喜  正式定了
So, congratulations, it's official.

147
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,370
唐娜·埃默森
Donna Emerson.

148
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,280
你真是受不了克拉克这个名字  是吧
You really couldn't stand being a Clark, could you?

149
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,400
埃默森是三音节  有品味  懂吗
Emerson has three syllables. It's got stature, you know?

150
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,520
再说  在招牌上还能多占点地方
Plus, it takes up more space on the sign, so.

151
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,670
我的姓和你爸爸的姓  有区别吗
Well, my name, your dad's name-- what's the difference?

152
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,550
我们该走了
We should probably get a move on

153
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,310
要不就赶不上订的位置了  小戈
if we want to get our reservation, Gordo.

154
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,270
好  米歇尔  这是唐娜
Um, yeah. Uh, Michelle, this is Donna.

155
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,430
-唐娜  米歇尔  -就是这位啊
- Donna, this is Michelle. - Oh, of course.

156
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,240
很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you.

157
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,560
彼此彼此
You as well.

158
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,040
等我付了账就走好吗
Um, let me just close out my tab?

159
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,450
当然  我去拿衣服
Sure, yeah. I'm gonna grab my coat.

160
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,500
很高兴见到你
It was-- It was nice meeting you.

161
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,690
成小戈啦
Gordo?

162
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,090
埃默森女士
Ms. Emerson.

163
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,930
她看起来挺好的
She seems nice.

164
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,090
确实
She is.

165
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,540
周五你能照看一下琼妮吗
Hey, can you watch Joanie on Friday?

166
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,180
海莉还在太空夏令营呢
Haley's still at space camp and, you know,

167
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,550
琼妮就听听唱片  玩玩拼贴画
Joanie just listens to CDs and makes collages.

168
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,100
你也不用做什么
You really don't have to do anything.

169
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,830
黛安去了葡萄园
Look, Diane's at the Vineyard,

170
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,070
伊莱亚斯去了计算机分销商展览
Elias is at Comdex,

171
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,370
吉尔森也帮不上忙
Gilson's useless,

172
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,270
整个公司都由我负责
so, the whole company's on my shoulders.

173
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,720
我就是想问一下
I just thought I'd ask.

174
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,390
认了吧  轮到你了
Suck it up. It's your turn.

175
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,820
-喂  -乔
- Yeah? - Joe.

176
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,700
我是唐娜
It's Donna.

177
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,000
唐娜·克拉克
Donna Clark.

178
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,890
你好吗
How have you been?

179
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,880
你不该知道这个号码
You shouldn't have this number.

180
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,900
这样吧  我直说了
All right, look, I'll cut to the chase.

181
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,510
你会去计算机分销商展览吗
Are you going to Comdex?

182
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,200
有什么事吗  唐娜
What do you want, Donna?

183
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,570
卡梅伦会去
Cameron will be there.

184
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,850
我想给你发点东西
I want to send you something...

185
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,550
转交给她  一份备忘录
to give to her-- a memo.

186
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,680
你要我去展会
You want me to go to Comdex

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,290
给卡梅伦
to give Cameron...

188
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,290
一份备忘录
a memo?

189
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,050
你看看吧
Just read it.

190
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,070
如果你像我一样被打动
If it makes the same impression on you as it made on me,

191
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,250
你会乘最近一班飞机去维加斯
you'll be on the next plane to Vegas.

192
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,200
你那么迫切想联系上卡梅伦
If you want to get in touch with Cameron so bad,

193
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,110
为何不直接找她  却打给我
why are you calling me, not her?

194
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,970
你清楚原因
You know why.

195
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,410
乔  这次机会很适合她
Joe, this thing is perfect for her.

196
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,560
你...看看就明白了
Just... read it. You'll see.

197
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,090
我帮不了你  再见  唐娜
I can't help you. Good-bye, Donna.

198
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,150
豪伊兰顿太太
Mrs. Howe-Rendon?

199
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,560
我差点没认出你
I almost didn't recognize you.

200
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,570
我以为你会穿一件皮夹克
I expected you'd be wearing a leather jacket

201
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,170
还有好多文身
and have bunch of tattoos.

202
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,120
像《太空摩托》里那样
Like in Space Bike.

203
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,380
我们不一样
We're different people.

204
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,550
当然
Of course.

205
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,530
我带你过去
Let's get you set up.

206
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,010
他们就为这个
They fly you all the way

207
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,510
让你大老远从远东飞过来
out from the Orient just for this?

208
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,790
太牛了
Amazing.

209
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,490
就是这里
Here it is.

210
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,440
你好  我是特蕾西
Hi, I'm Tracy.

211
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,690
你好  特蕾西
Hi, Tracy.

212
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,910
他们叫我别坐在摩托上
They told me not to sit on the bike

213
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,280
因为我可能会坐坏它
because I might crush it.

214
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,230
他们说得对
That's probably good advice.

215
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,650
签售开始前
You've got a few minutes to settle in

216
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,640
你有几分钟准备一下
before the signing starts.

217
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,810
好啊
Oh, yeah.

218
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,310
这是你的午餐
Here's your lunch.

219
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,010
按照你的要求
As you requested,

220
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,560
加豆加奶酪的玉米煎饼
a bean and cheese burrito.

221
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,410
谢谢
Thank you.

222
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,440
我在日本待四年了
I've been in Japan for four years.

223
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,200
如果要我用一个词来形容自己的话
If I had to choose one word to describe myself,

224
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,420
我想我会说"探求者"
I guess I would say, um, "Seeker."

225
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,960
对  还有
Yeah, you know? And, uh...

226
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,360
"给予者"  是的
and "Giver." Yeah.

227
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,910
虽然我是个技术专家
I mean, I'm a tech professional

228
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,300
但我不仅仅只会编程
but I'm not just bits and bytes.

229
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,320
我拥有一家区域网络公司
I own a regional network

230
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,650
它是国家科学基金网的一部分
that's part of NSFNET,

231
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,210
基于Unix的路由  通过T1主干网
which connects researchers

232
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,270
让研究人员能与
to the National Science Foundation

233
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,810
国家科学基金会
super-computing center,

234
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,950
超级计算机中心相连
via T-1 backbone through a Unix-based rout--

235
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,290
这么说吧  我干得挺好的
Let's just say I do well for myself.

236
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,480
消遣对我来说很重要
Fun is very important to me,

237
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,520
如果随意的话
and listen, if, you know, it's casual,

238
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,740
如果保持随意的话  我可以接受
you know, it stays casual, I'm okay with that.

239
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,640
如果发展到稍正式一点的话
And if it becomes something more than casual

240
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,130
那我也可以接受
then I'm okay with that too. Yeah.

241
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,850
我喜欢露营  我真的很喜欢露营
And I like camping. I really like camping.

242
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,420
你喜欢露营吗
Do-- do you like camping?

243
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,030
最近  我开始学习烹饪  做饭
Recently, I've gotten into fine cuisine, uh, cooking.

244
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,160
真正的做饭
But, like, really doing it.

245
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,330
你可以做点什么
You get to cook something,

246
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,950
然后看着你做的东西
and then you look at it,

247
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,400
你会想"这是我做的"
and you think, "I made this!"

248
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,000
你把它吃了然后继续自己的生活
And then you get to eat it and then move on.

249
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,640
这让我很开心
That makes me happy.

250
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,490
我叫...我能看着镜头吗
My, uh, name-- Can I look into the thing?

251
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,240
-我叫戈登  -琼妮
- Uh, my name is Gordon... - Joanie?

252
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,540
编号108A-2
number 108A-2...

253
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,260
琼妮  这可是私人的东西
Joanie, that is private.

254
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,970
是啊  用一段录像向世人宣布
Yeah. Making a video that screams

255
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,150
"我需要上床"的确挺私人的
"I need to get laid" is totally private.

256
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,460
"上床"  谁教你的
"Get laid"? Who taught you that?

257
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,990
爸  学校有些孩子在停车场
Dad, I know kids in school giving handjobs

258
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,800
给人打飞机  我不是小孩子了
in the parking lot. I'm not a kid.

259
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,300
不  你不知道  是的  你是小孩子
No, you don't. And yes, you are.

260
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,140
好了  我什么时候送你去派对
All right. Now, what time am I taking you to this party?

261
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,010
-九点开始  -我能早点送你去吗
- It starts at 9:00. - Can I take you a little earlier?

262
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,350
我的女伴  好吧
My date-- Okay.

263
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,920
我要为一个人做晚饭  她七点半到
I'm cooking dinner for someone and she'll be here at 7:30.

264
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,190
可詹妮弗六点半要看《灵异入侵2》
Yeah, but Jennifer is seeing Child's Play 2 at 6:30

265
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,600
好跟踪博比·奥斯托夫
to go stalk Bobby Ostoff.

266
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,310
所以  她差不多八点半才能回来
So, she probably won't even be back until 8:30.

267
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,870
派对是在詹妮弗家吗
The party's at Jennifer's?

268
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,050
妈妈说我可以去
Mom said I could go.

269
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,450
你妈告诉我戴安这周都去出差
Yeah, well, Mom told me that Diane was out of town all week.

270
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,700
你不能去没有家长的派对
You can't go to a party if there aren't any parents there.

271
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,420
-你知道的  -可妈妈说我能去
- You know that. - But Mom said!

272
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,240
琼妮  你和我在一起的时候
Joanie, when you're staying with me,

273
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,650
-就由我说了算  -天啊
- I make the decisions. - God!

274
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,330
琼妮
Joanie?

275
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,880
谢谢
Thanks.

276
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:00,340
我为《太空摩托5》想了些绝妙的点子
Right, okay, so I've got some banging ideas for Space Bike 5.

277
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,800
有这么一条太空金鱼
Okay, so there's this-- there's this space goldfish--

278
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,370
好极了  那边付款
Fantastic! So, just pay over there.

279
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,900
你好  我叫杰西卡
Hi, I'm Jessica.

亚历克斯
Alex.

281
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,360
你俩回头去看雅达利演讲吗
You two going to the Atari keynote later?

282
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,150
-当然  -很好
- Yeah. - Good.

283
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,610
别让那样的男生在你们前面加塞
Don't let boys like that push their way in front of you.

284
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,220
-好的  -好
- Okay. - Okay.

285
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,620
能给"乔"签个名吗
Can you make it out to "Joe"?

286
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,480
那里的文化真是博大精深
Yeah, it's just a really amazing culture, you know?

287
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,270
你会说日语吗
Do you even speak Japanese?

288
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,450
这句话的意思是  "请把虾头去掉"
That means, "I don't want the shrimp with the heads on."

289
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,550
这句话在东京非常管用
It's a very useful phrase in Tokyo.

290
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,800
那你会留下来吗
So, you're gonna stay?

291
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,390
也许会吧
Maybe, yeah.

292
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,850
我不知道  我们真在那儿安顿下来了
It's-- I don't know, we've really settled in.

293
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,960
一开始很奇怪
It was weird at first.

294
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,600
就像外星人  你懂吗
Like, alien, you know?

295
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,660
《太空摩托2》的灵感就是这么来的
And that's what Space Bike 2 was all about.

296
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,600
就是  汤姆一直工作很忙
It was just, Tom was working a ton

297
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,630
而我在这座陌生的城市里闲逛 
and I was wandering around this strange city

298
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,350
感觉迷茫  然后...
feeling lost. And then...

299
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,260
怎么说呢  有一天我突然决定要做这个
I don't know, one day I just decided to give myself over to it.

300
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,050
就这样  像有个开关
Just like that, like a-- like a switch...

301
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,270
在你脑中弹开了
flicked in your brain?

302
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,720
是啊
Yeah.

303
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,660
就是  你经历人生
It's just, you go through life

304
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,420
对自己是谁  自己做什么
and you have this idea of who you are,

305
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,080
有一定的看法  然后...
and what you do, and then...

306
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,320
突然发现不是那么回事
you discover it's total bullshit.

307
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,490
只是个防御机制
It's a defense mechanism,

308
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,510
一旦你停止维护自己  你就可以
and once you stop defending yourself you can be

309
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,880
成为别的  而那...
all these other things, and that...

310
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,130
-是啊  -很俗气吧
- Yeah. - seems totally cheesy.

311
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,360
不  并不
No, it's not.

312
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,820
我现在都用不好筷子
I still suck at using chopsticks.

313
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
那  你来这儿干什么
So, what are you doing here?

314
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,720
你还在做咨询吗
Are you still consulting?

315
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,940
我正考虑再做回那个
I'm thinking about getting back into that,

316
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,390
如果有好机会
if the gig is right.

317
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,750
这几年变化这么大  真不可思议
It's amazing how much changes in just a few years.

318
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,070
还有这么多没变
And how much stays the same.

319
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,140
你觉得怎么样
So, what do you think?

320
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,330
我该去看看什么
What should I see?

321
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,440
你可以跳过所有的笔记本电脑
Well, you can skip all the laptops.

322
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,830
它们都是万变不离其宗
They're just variations on a theme.

323
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,530
微软的展位真是...
The Microsoft booth is "Ugh."

324
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,470
盖茨的演讲没那么好
Gates' speech is overrated.

325
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,960
去拿个抄本就行了
Just get the transcript.

326
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,660
飞利浦刚发布了一个可录音的CD
Oh, Phillips just released a recordable CD

327
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,030
Adobe新添了个PS软件还挺酷的
and Adobe added some cool stuff to this thing called Photoshop.

328
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,630
就这样...
So...

329
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,680
好吧
Yeah, great.

330
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,370
有意思
That's interesting.

331
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,950
是啊
Yeah.

332
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,510
天啊  真是
Well, God, it was--

333
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,090
见到你真好
it was great to see you,

334
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,010
我很开心
and, this was a lot of fun.

335
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,300
慢着  那是...
Wait. Are those...

336
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,330
83年那伙人吗
those guys from '83

337
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,680
他们的打印机特别差劲那个
that had that really terrible printer?

338
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,960
你跟他们说你是IBM的
You convinced them you were from IBM?

339
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,400
嗯  我们为了巨人买了他们的房间
Yeah. We bought out their suite for the Giant.

340
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,860
那个房间还赠送海鲜塔
That suite came with that free seafood tower.

341
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,140
你要干什么
what are you doing?

342
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:19,200
我们隆重推出  一体化兼容打印设备
Offering, fully-integrated TypeKit compatibility

343
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,480
高品质的散热器
while our superior heat sink

344
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,020
可以保证你们的...
ensures that your...

345
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,380
报告会不出岔子  而是一飞...
presentation won't drown, but rather, float...

346
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,990
冲天
Into the sky.

347
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,680
而且绝不会卡纸
Moreover, paper jams can scram...

348
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,400
这是难免的
That just happens.

349
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,790
你们可以稍作休息...
Meaning that you can sit back and relax....

350
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:43,410
享受一下数据的传送
And enjoy the flight-- the flight of your data, that is,

351
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,690
因为传输速度太快了
due to transfer speeds so fast

352
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,780
会让你觉得文件在...
that you'll think your documents were...

353
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,380
加油  小皮
Come on. Come on, Petey.

354
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,010
有点风  用手挡一下
There's a little breeze. Get your hand in front of it.

355
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,330
用手背试试
Use your backhand.

356
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,730
飞驰[着火了]
On fire.

357
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,110
不错  不错
Cool, cool, cool.

358
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:02,370
这是叫"S打印机"吗
So, it's called the, uh, the "S Printer"?

359
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,690
不  是"速打机"
Oh, no, ... "Sprinter."

360
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,740
-因为打印得非常快  -没有空格
- Because it prints really fast. - No space.

361
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,130
和火的比喻放一起有点混乱吧
It's kind of confusing with the flame gag, though.

362
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,310
这是混合隐喻
It's a mixed metaphor.

363
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,650
"S打印机"的确听起来更棒
"S Printer" does sound better, though.

364
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,690
-是吧  -没错  更严谨一些
- Doesn't it? - Yeah. It's got rigor behind it.

365
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,530
就好像研发部门对A到R型都不满意
Like the R&D Department was unsatisfied with models A through R,

366
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,120
到最后  经过大量努力...
and then finally, after a lot of sweat and tears...

367
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,860
我们自豪推出S版
We proudly bring you version S.

368
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,430
是速打机
It's the Sprinter.

369
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,890
没有空格
No space.

370
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,820
我认识你吗
Hey, do I know you?

371
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,900
拿个打火机吧  只能拿一个
Here, help yourself to a lighter. No, just one, please.

372
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,140
-你拿太多了  -祝你们好运
- Oh, that's a lot. - Good luck, guys.

373
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,430
-不能全部...  -她拿太多了
- Not all of-- - She took so many.

374
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,040
只能拿一个  谢谢  一个
Just one, please, one.

375
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,510
米歇尔
Michelle.

376
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,270
你穿的是什么  这...
What you got, what's--

377
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,430
那是
Oh, it,

378
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,560
写的是"亲亲厨师"  不过是二进制码
it says "Kiss the cook", but in binary code.

379
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,540
那么
So.

380
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,250
好吧
Oh. Well.

381
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,400
闻起来真香
It smells great.

382
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,750
是意大利肉酱
That's the Bolognese.

383
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,290
很多人以为面条起源于意大利
You know, a lot of people think that pasta's Italian,

384
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,830
其实是起源于中国
but it actually originated in China.

385
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,710
没错  公元前1100年
Yeah, 1100 B.C.

386
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,670
你要送我去派对  我给妈妈留言了
You're taking me to the party. I left a message on Mom's service.

387
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,990
-她会告诉你让我去  -琼妮
- She's gonna tell you to let me go. - Joanie?

388
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,520
这是米歇尔
This is Michelle.

389
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,520
米歇尔  这是我可爱的女儿  琼妮
Michelle, this is my lovely daughter, Joanie.

390
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,190
你好
Hello.

391
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,250
我喜欢你的上衣
I, -- I like your shirt.

392
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,380
看起来...很有内涵
It's very... cultural.

393
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,280
你喜欢内涵的
Do you like culture?

394
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,960
是什么意思
What's it, say?

395
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,650
"少年"在日语中是男孩的意思
Well, "shonen" is Japanese for "boy."

396
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,140
意思是男孩的刀
So, it means "boy knife."

397
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,470
男孩的刀就是指丁丁
"Boy knife" means "dick."

398
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,030
你想来点红酒吗
Do you want some wine?

399
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,100
我想知道要到多高
I wonder how high you'd have to be up

400
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,560
才能吐口唾沫就能砸死个人
for your spit to actually kill someone.

401
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,120
看看我们有什么宝贝
Okay, let's see what we got.

402
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,430
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

403
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,070
别了  显得你屁股很大
Oh, I wouldn't. They make your ass look big.

404
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,960
好吧
Oh, okay.

405
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,090
规则是这样的
Here are the rules.

406
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,990
四排打火机
Four rows of lighters.

407
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,620
轮到你时  只要是同一排的
When it's your turn, you can take as many

408
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,350
随便你拿走几个打火机
or as few as you want, as long as they're from the same row.

409
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,400
拿走最后一个打火机的人输
The person who ends up with the last lighter loses.

410
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,980
你想第一个来还是第二个来
You wanna go first or second?

411
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,120
真大胆
Bold.

412
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,270
楼下有什么吸引你的产品吗
Is there anything on the floor catch your eye?

413
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,180
没有  我觉得速打机是最棒的
No, I'm going whole hog on the Sprinter.

414
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,670
这些家伙掌握了时代的潮流
Those guys really have their finger on the pulse.

415
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,000
其实...
Actually it was...

416
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,970
我看花了眼
it was all pretty overwhelming.

417
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,960
如果你仔细看
You know, if you look closely,

418
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,920
那些笨蛋中还是有钻石的
there are some diamonds in those dorks.

419
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,700
你真希望我搭上谁吗
Would you really wish me on anyone?

420
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,630
你输了
You lose.

421
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,850
这次你先来
You go first this time.

422
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,050
我们合作的时候
Hey, I knew what I was doing,

423
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,040
我知道自己在干什么
you know, when we worked together.

424
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,100
穆特尼自己一头扎进深渊
And Mutiny took a nosedive all on its own,

425
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,200
都不需要你来搅和
didn't need you to screw that one up for us.

426
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,960
戈登
And Gordon,

427
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,070
会第一个承认是自己做的选择
would be the first to admit that he made his own bed.

428
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,390
是啊  但是...
Yeah, but...

429
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,980
但是莱恩  对吧
But Ryan, right?

430
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,480
是啊  汤姆和我...
Yeah, Tom and I were...

431
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,550
听说时正要去日本
leaving for Japan when we heard.

432
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,650
刚开始我...
At first I was...

433
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,790
很生气
angry.

434
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,960
气你
At you...

435
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,000
也气他
and at him.

436
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,820
还有我自己
And at myself...

437
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,620
因为还有好多话没和他说
for all these things I never said to him.

438
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,800
然后我意识到
Then I realized

439
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,210
没人能帮到他
there was nothing anyone could have done about it.

440
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,000
你和我都不行
Not you and not me.

441
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,860
-你不能确定  -你也是
- You don't know that. - Neither do you.

442
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,610
你没有那么大威力
You're not that powerful.

443
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,980
最终  我的愤怒
So, eventually, my anger

444
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,480
变成了悲伤
turned into sadness, and...

445
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,050
那没事的  那是健康的
that's fine, that's healthy.

446
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,690
悲伤吧
I mean, yes, be sad.

447
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,630
但是  别再责怪自己了
But Jesus, stop blaming yourself.

448
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,400
我赢了
I win.

449
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,880
也不是为了莱恩
This isn't about Ryan.

450
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,230
是...
It's...

451
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,380
我就是觉得你不该
I'm just saying I don't think you should...

452
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,670
让世界享受不到你的工作
deprive the world of what you do.

453
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,420
好吧
Okay.

454
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,760
我做什么
What is it that I do?

455
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:10,450
真正的改变
It's so hard...

456
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,120
是很难实现的
to bring about actual change.

457
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,810
真正的改变
Real change.

458
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,960
全世界
The whole world

459
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,620
都会阴谋阻止改变
conspires to stop that from happening.

460
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,900
但你能让人们聚在一起
But you bring people together.

461
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,840
你能...创造改变
You... create change.

462
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,370
我觉得那...
I think that that's...

463
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,550
非常棒
really great.

464
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,790
我有个
Hey, so I have this

465
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,010
不得不去的雅达利派对
Atari party that I have to go to

466
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,800
如果你愿意来  跟我一起喝醉
that would be so much more fun if you would come

467
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,250
就会好玩得多
and get drunk with me.

468
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,950
是让我替你挡住狂热粉丝吗
What, so I can fend off your groupies?

469
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,160
没错
Exactly.

470
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,220
我没穿合适的衣服
I'm not really dressed for that kind of thing.

471
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,870
好吧
Okay.

472
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,500
那...
Well...

473
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,670
好了
Okay.

474
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,150
这下行了
Now I'm ready.

475
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,510
未来一片光明啊
The future's so bright.

476
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,870
总之  该说重点了
Anyways, back to the important stuff.

477
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,000
知道大部分人为什么做不好意面吗
Do you know why most people screw up their pasta?

478
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,150
-来了  -水加的盐不够
- Here we go. - Not salting the water enough.

479
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,250
应该有海洋的味道
You know, it should taste like the ocean.

480
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,070
如果比例得当
You know, when properly portioned,

481
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,770
盐不会让食物太咸
salt will not make food taste salty,

482
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:48,240
而是增强已经存在的味道
but instead will enhance the flavors that are already present.

483
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,640
找我的  妈妈打来的
It's for me. It's my mom.

484
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,070
她是一家风投公司的合伙人
She's a partner at a VC firm

485
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,230
所以她有自己的留言服务
so she has her own messaging service.

486
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,800
妈妈
Mom?

487
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,930
琼妮  我收到你的留言了  怎么回事
Joanie, I got your voicemail. What's going on?

488
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,200
你说得好像第三次世界大战
You made it sound like World War III ...

489
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,950
-开始了  -爸不许我去参加派对
- from your message. - Yeah, Dad won't let me go to the party,

490
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,560
太过分了  你明明说我可以去的
which is bullshit because you explicitly told me I could go.

491
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,900
他肯定有原因的  亲爱的
I'm sure he has good reasons, Bug.

492
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,510
我根本没有理由该被困在这里
There is no good reason why I should be stuck here

493
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,150
跟超级大厨
making pasta from scratch

494
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,880
和不知哪来的女人一起从零做意面
with freaking Chef Boyardee and some random lady.

495
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,330
是那个米歇尔吗
Is it that Michelle woman?

496
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:21,560
没错  她是爸爸的员工
Bingo-rama. She works for Dad.

497
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,640
听着  你在爸爸家  就得听他的
Look, when you're at Dad's house, his word goes.

498
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,700
你知道规矩的
You know the rules.

499
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,200
-你不能跟他谈谈吗  -不行  我没时间
- Can you just talk to him? - No, I don't have time--

500
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,790
爸  妈妈想跟你谈谈
Dad! Mom wants to talk to you.

501
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,300
你几年级了
So, what grade are you in?

502
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,490
我马上就要走了
You know, I'm gonna, like, go in a second.

503
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,990
你不用非得跟我说话
You don't have to talk to me anymore.

504
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,760
唐娜  我现在不想谈这个
Donna, I don't wanna have this conversation right now.

505
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,130
-我也不想  -她想去詹妮弗家
- Neither do I. - She wants to go over to Jennifer's

506
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,470
但是那里根本不会有家长
and there's not gonna be any parents there.

507
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,240
我已经跟她说她得听你的
I already told her that she has to listen to you.

508
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,790
她让你接电话  是以为我们能大吵一架
She just put you on the phone because she thought we'd fight

509
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,450
让她渔翁得利
and she'd come out on top.

510
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,920
你什么时候还做意面了
Since when do you make pasta?

511
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,540
我...
Oh, well, I-I--

512
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,200
我上了烹饪课
I took a cooking class.

513
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,970
我父母也在我小时候离婚了
My parents got divorced when I was little, too,

514
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,790
所以  我知道滋味不好受
so, I know it stinks.

515
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,460
但会好起来的
But it gets better.

516
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,770
好吧  你别想去了
All right, you're, uh, you're not going.

517
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,340
就算保守估计声音辨识部件的
So, even with a conservative estimate of the licensing fees

518
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,310
授权金
for the voice-recognition component,

519
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,360
三季度结束时
we'll be in three million

520
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,500
我们的产品也能进入三百万台家用电冰箱
domestic refrigerator-freezers by the end of Q3.

521
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,620
第四季度就能盈利了
And I'll hit profitability by Q4.

522
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,770
你们做什么的
So, what is it you do?

523
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,880
-我觉得就是他了  -我也觉得
- I think this is definitely him. - I think it's him!

524
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,750
听着  我们在此授予你...
Listen, man, we hereby confer upon you--

525
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,590
鲍勃
Uh, Bob.

526
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,090

00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,600
过上梦想的生活吧  鲍勃
Live the life of your words, Bob.

536
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,210
要续杯吗
You want a refill?

537
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,630
好
Yeah!

538
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,070
老天爷  我的续杯都想续杯
Jesus, my refills want refills!

539
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,450
我超爱《太空摩托》
I love Space Bike!

540
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,290
我爱你
I love you!

541
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,610
卡梅伦
Cameron?

542
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,760
卡梅伦
Cameron!

543
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,090
你好吗  日本好吗
How are you? How's Japan?

544
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,750
你怎么来了
What are you doing here?

545
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,420
我就是...
You know, I just...

546
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,530
来派对上转转
came to make an appearance at the parties, and...

547
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,160
好吧
Okay--

548
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,800
我
Look, I--

549
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,580
是来见你的
I came to see you.

550
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,950
你为什么要那么做
I don't know why you would do that.

551
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,220
因为我有...
Well, because I've got this--

552
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,140
有样东西
There's this thing.

553
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:20,360
非常棒  我想跟你分享
It's really exciting and I want to show it to you.

554
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,650
-你开玩笑呢  -求你
- You've got to be kidding. - Please, just--

555
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,590
别这样  明天跟我吃午饭吧
Come on, have lunch with me tomorrow.

556
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,450
不  我要飞早班机去东京
No, I'm on an early flight out to Tokyo.

557
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,470
都四年了  我们得...
It's been four years, we need to--

558
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,310
我们不用做什么
We don't need to do anything!

559
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,720
我们都做过我们不以为傲的事
We both did things we're not proud of,

560
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,780
如果能让时间倒流
and if could turn back the clock,

561
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,450
我们肯定不会那么做的
I'm sure we'd do it differently.

562
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,450
真是难以置信
I can't believe this is happening.

563
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,860
难道你就完全放下过去了吗
What, you're gonna tell me that you've completely moved on?

564
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,620
没有
No.

565
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,490
我每天都会想你和我
I think about you and me every day.

566
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,060
那让我非常生气
And it makes me furious.

567
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,430
那我们想办法和好  我想弥补
So, let's fix it. I wanna fix it.

568
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,640
我不想
I don't.

569
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,590
你还好吗
Everything okay?

570
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,340
我们走吧
Let's go.

571
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,510
帕玛森干酪
Parmigiano-Reggiano?

572
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,050
好的  谢谢
Yes, please.

573
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,410
我是素食主义者
I'm a vegetarian.

574
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,330
是吗  什么时候开始的
Oh, yeah? Since when?

575
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,930
自从我开始关注那些与我们
Since I started paying attention to the thinking,

576
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,980
共处在一个星球上的有思想的生灵
feeling creatures we share the planet with,

577
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,240
并且意识到他们可能不想被吃
and realized they probably don't like being eaten.

578
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,400
就是从那时开始
That's since when.

579
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,500
那自己把你的那份洗掉吧
Well, you can rinse yours off.

580
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,690
太迟了  已经被玷污了
Too late. It's tainted.

581
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,200
味道真不错
This is really good.

582
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:49,950
谢谢
Grazie.

583
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,630
你放了什么
What did you put in this?

584
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,370
意大利肉酱
Ah, it's the Bolognese.

585
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,560
花了好久才做好  但是
It's taken a while to perfect, but--

586
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,430
你知道吗
Did you know

587
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,090
几乎所有在超市中买到的牛肉
that almost all beef you buy at the supermarket

588
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,790
都有大肠杆菌
tests positive for E. Coli?

589
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,260
因为牛被宰杀时会被砍头
Because cows, when they're slaughtered, are decapitated.

590
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,820
牛被砍头时
And when you decapitate a cow,

591
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,670
其内脏和胃里的东西
all the stuff in the intestines and the stomach

592
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,980
都会从脖子口喷涌而出  喷得一身
flies out through the neck hole, all over the body.

593
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,360
大肠杆菌只在粪便里有
And E. Coli is found only in excrement.

594
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,490
所以说
Basically...

595
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,860
你的意大利肉酱里有屎
there's shit in your Bolognese.

596
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,270
琼妮  我们在吃饭呢
Okay, Joanie, we are trying to eat.

597
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,240
我也是
So am I.

598
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,700
所以我们都得思考
And that's why we all need to think about the gross, and, like,

599
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,990
我们盘中食物所经历的非人道处理加工
inhumane process that we get all the stuff we consume on our plates.

600
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,530
你知道大部分
Well, did you know there's

601
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,840
牛奶里都有可检测到的奶牛尿吗
a detectable level of cow piss in most milk?

602
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,290
我能理解  我五岁时
You know, I understand. When I was five,

603
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,830
放弃吃鸡蛋一整年
I gave up eggs for a whole year

604
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,570
因为我以为打碎鸡蛋时
because I thought when you cracked the eggs,

605
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:55,950
就杀死了小鸡宝宝
that you were killing little baby chicks,

606
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,050
每次我爸做煎蛋饼
and every time my dad made an omelet

607
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,600
我都会泪流满面
I would just burst into tears

608
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,890
大哭几小时
and just cry for hours.

609
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:04,170
我14了  不是五岁
I'm 14, not five.

610
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,130
这是个阶段  会过去的
She'll grow out of it. It's a phase.

611
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,150
你觉得这只是个阶段
You think this is just a phase?

612
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,910
好吧  琼妮  要不你拿盘子去隔壁屋吃
Okay, Joanie, why don't you take your plate into the other room

613
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,520
我们明天再谈
and we'll talk about this tomorrow.

614
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,550
好啊
Fine.

615
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,590
真抱歉
I am so sorry.

616
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,120
不不  何必呢
No. No, no, no. Why? I mean,

617
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,560
我真的几乎尝不出你意面里的屎味儿
I honestly can barely taste the shit in your spaghetti.

618
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,010
对于我  友谊是...
Uh, for me, friendship is...

619
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,550
非常重要的  我...
is very important. I mean, I...

620
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,930
我不仅仅只会编程
It's not all bits and bytes for me.

621
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,490
我经常看电影
And I see a lot of movies

622
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,120
如果能有个特别的人
and it would just be nice to have someone special

623
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,520
跟我一起看  一起聊聊就太好了
to share that with or talk to about that stuff.

624
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,630
亲密  是好事
Intimacy, that's-- it's-- that's nice.

625
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,370
听着
So, listen, um.

626
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,510
我真的很抱歉
I-- I really am sorry.

627
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,440
我
I, um--

628
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,950
-我们办公室见  -好
- I'll see you at the office. - Okay.

629
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,280
琼妮
Joanie.

630
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,760
你刚刚那是做什么
What the hell was that?

631
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,790
你就该让我去派对
You should have just let me go the party.

632
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,390
琼妮  就算你不开心
Joanie, just because you are unhappy

633
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,460
不代表你可以把你的痛苦
does not mean that you can inflict your total misery

634
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:54,970
施加到其他人身上
onto everyone else.

635
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,600
你太明显了
You're so obvious!

636
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,820
什么意思
What is that supposed to mean?

637
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,890
之前你为妈妈工作  如今米歇尔为你工作
You work for Mom and now Michelle works for you.

638
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,080
你可以找更好的
You could do better.

639
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,840
你找到过一次了
You already did once.

640
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,520
她真让人难以置信
Can you believe her?

641
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,300
她就好像埋伏了我
It's like she ambushed me.

642
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,610
她干吗非要和好
Why does she care so much about kissing and making up?

643
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,700
我们都不住在一个国家了
We don't even live in the same country anymore.

644
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,460
她打给了我
She called me.

645
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,070
几天前
A few days ago.

646
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,710
为什么
Why?

647
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,890
她要我找到你
She wanted me to find you...

648
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,650
向你展示一个什么点子
and bring you some idea.

649
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,410
你是为此而来的吗
That's why you're here?

650
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:58,880
不是
No.

651
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,610
我说她如果想跟你谈  就该自己来
I told her if she wanted to talk to you, she could do it herself.

652
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,400
我都不知道那个点子是什么
I don't even know what the idea was.

653
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,550
我没看  也不在乎
I didn't read it and I don't care.

654
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,430
别这样  卡梅
Come on, Cam.

655
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,490
你可以信任我
You can trust me.

656
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,840
天呐  太难喝了
God, that's terrible.

657
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,260
我好像想出来了
Hey, I think I figured it out.

658
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,390
你打不赢我
You can't beat me. It's--

659
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,160
这是个系统  你得数尼姆和
It's a system. You have to count in Nim sums.

660
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,310
是有窍门的
It's just a trick.

661
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,390
你
Why...

662
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,250
为什么来
are you here?

663
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:31,970
你知道
You know why.

664
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,540
不
Nope.

665
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,140
告诉我
Tell me.

666
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,750
你
You.

667
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,380
我来见你
I came to see you.

668
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,320
我们不该待在这上面
We shouldn't be up here.

669
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,360
已经晚了
It's getting late.

670
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,930
我明早还得早走
I have to leave early tomorrow.

671
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,770
今晚就到这儿吧
Maybe we should call it a night.

672
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,230
嗯
Yeah.

673
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,430
是啊  就到这儿吧
Yeah, we should call it a night.

674
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,410
坚持
Consistency.

675
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,110
这我敬佩
I can admire that.

676
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:19,180
天呐  我特讨厌斯莱特
God, I hate it when Slater does that

677
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,140
傻乎乎地转椅子
stupid turnaround thing with his chair.

678
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,030
是啊
I know.

679
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,050
我们都懂  你是酷酷的运动员
It's like, okay, we get it, you're the cool jock.

680
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,700
不是吧
Are you serious?

681
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,620
怎么了
What?

682
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,550
-你  -我不能只给自己一个标签
- You-- - I can't totally commit to a label.

683
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,910
人不是单一的
People aren't one thing.

684
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:43,770
是啊
Yeah.

685
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,130
你说得对
You're right.

686
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,290
好吧
All right.

687
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,840
今早很严重吗
Is it bad this morning?

688
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,370
不  没事
No, it's fine.

689
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,410
我就是有点僵硬
I'm just a little stiff.

690
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:10,940
洗个热水澡就行了
Nothing a hot shower won't fix.

691
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:18,480
真是荒唐
This is ridiculous.

692
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,100
我要逼你跟我换卧室
I'm making you switch bedrooms with me.

693
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:23,300
爬楼梯简直太傻了
Climbing these stairs is totally dumbass.

694
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,990
是啊  那对你肯定好处多多
Yeah. I'm sure that would work out great for you.

695
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,370
一张好床  大衣橱
Nice fancy bed, big closet...

696
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,350
其实我想要的是浴室
Oh, it's really the bathroom I'm after.

697
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,990
跟你合作
Working with you was...

698
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,920
是我这辈子最快乐的时光
the most fun I ever had in my life.

699
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,440
好吗
Okay?

700
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:11,990
卡梅
Oh, Cam.

701
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,840
我好几次都想打电话
I picked up the phone so many times.

702
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,710
但从未真打过  是吧
Never actually called, though. Did you?

703
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,190
但是...
Well...

704
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,730
我现在来了
I'm here now.

705
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,660
你看了吗
Did you even read it?

706
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:37,260
什么
What?

707
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,140
我发给乔的东西  那个点子

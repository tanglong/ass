有人在吗
Hello?

39
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,340
我来早了吗  我以为说的是九点
Am I early? I thought we said 9:00.

40
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,190
没有  是九点
Uh, no, yeah. Yeah, 9:00.

41
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,010
她到了吗
She here yet?

42
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,830
我知道她的飞机已经着陆了
Uh, I know her plane landed,

43
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,590
所以  只要她上了飞机就会来
so... as long as she's on it.

44
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,360
路上还好吧
The drive okay?

45
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,430
还好  因为是周末
Yeah, yeah. It's the weekend,

46
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,780
又碰上节假日  所以...
plus the holiday, so...

47
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,020
-对啊  -是啊  路上都没车
- Oh, right. - Yeah, there was no traffic.

48
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,830
-M网络是什么

Anyway, my VC firm held onto the lease

53
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,090
就是以防我们哪天需要个空场地
just in case we needed a raw space

给哪个小投资项目
for some tadpole investment.

55
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,700
真挺空的
It's pretty raw.

56
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,420
是啊  我们四年前搬进去时
Yeah, well, the building was in shambles

57
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,250
这里就像座废墟
when we moved in four years ago.

58
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,740
去年的地震肯定也帮了倒忙
I'm sure last year's quake didn't help.

59
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,190
天啊  那太糟了
Oh, God, that was crazy.

60
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,500
什么
What?

61
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,630
-地震  -是啊
- The earthquake. - Oh, yeah.

62
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,280
-那时你在哪  -工作
- Where were you? - Work.

63
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,300
-你呢  -也是
- How about you? - Work.

64
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,780
你是怎么想着来这儿开会的
How come you wanted to meet here?

65
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,480
不是我想的
Oh, I didn't.

66
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,070
是卡梅隆的主意  谁知道呢  也许
Cameron did. Who knows? Maybe...

67
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,940
她想再来看看
she wanted to see it again.

68
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,950
顺便说下  我...
By the way, I--

69
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,370
我不是有意没问你就邀请戈登来的
I didn't mean to invite Gordon without talking to you.

70
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,360
-没关系  没事  -但是我...
- No, no, it's fine. - But I--

71
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,070
我看了论文  觉得这件事很了不起
I just read the paper and I thought it was something phenomenal,

72
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,180
况且他还在运营我们建造的区域网络
and he's still running the regional network we built,

73
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,390
所以就没多想
so it was a no-brainer.

74
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,890
合情合理
Makes perfect sense.

75
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,300
我很遗憾
I'm so sorry about that.

76
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,310
不用  真的  没事  我很高兴他能来
No, really, it's fine. I'm glad he's coming.

77
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,420
不  我是指  你们离婚了
No, I-- the divorce.

78
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,310
是啊
Right.

79
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,550
你们两个竟然...
That the two of you...

80
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,260
-是啊  -离婚了
- Yeah. - ...got a divorce.

81
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,950
不管怎样...
Anyway...

82
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,620
-真多谢你  -没事的
- I really appreciate it. - It's no problem.

83
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,170
我们就花几天看看
I mean, it's just a couple of days for us to see

84
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,030
是不是值得投入精力
if there's even a "There" There.

85
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,220
当然
Yeah, of course.

86
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,330
但是  我很激动
But... I'm excited.

87
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,990
我也很激动
I'm excited, too.

88
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,950
我真的挺兴奋的  我...
I'm really excited. I--

89
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,590
抱歉我来晚了
Hey, sorry I'm late.

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,200
卡梅伦来了吗
Is Cameron here?

91
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,280
多久没见了
How long has it been?

92
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,980
上次是什么时候  四月吗
What was that, April?

93
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,370
是啊  其实是两年前的四月
Yeah, it was actually two Aprils ago.

94
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,640
-天哪  这么久了吗  -嗯
- Oh, jeez, it's been that long? - Yeah. Yeah.

95
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,040
-你看上去不错  -你也是
- Well, you look good. - So do you.

96
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,850
不  说真的  你看上去不错
No, I mean it, you look-- you look good.

97
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,040
谢谢
Thank you.

98
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,520
我能
Hey, can I, uh...

99
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,000
能让我们单独聊会儿吗
Can you give us a sec?

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,630
当然了
Oh, of course. Absolutely.

101
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,780
你们想聊多久...
Take all the time you...

102
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,200
-我能...  -好
- Um, can I...? - Yeah.

103
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,420
怎么了
What's up?

104
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,420
我来你没问题吧
Hey, uh, you're okay that I'm here, right?

105
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,270
考虑到我在干的事情
I just thought it was an interesting concept,

106
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,200
我觉得这是个很有趣的理念
given everything that I've been working on.

107
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,940
还有我很多年没见过卡梅伦了
And, you know, I haven't seen Cameron in years.

108
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,890
但我不想...这是你的主意  行吗
But look, I don't-- this is your thing, okay?

109
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,710
我不想妨碍你  我不想干涉
I don't want to get in the way. I don't want to interfere.

110
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,320
戈登  没事的  我很高兴你能来
Gordon, it's fine. I'm glad you're here.

111
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,420
他  我不太确定
Him? I'm not so sure.

112
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,960
我不知道
Yeah, I don't know.

113
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,140
我们不再联系的部分原因就是...
Part of the reason we've been losing touch is...

114
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,350
你该看看我们上次见面时他的样子
Well, you should have seen him the last time I did.

115
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,040
乔
Hey, Joe.

116
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,450
很高兴你来了
Glad you're here.

117
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,780
好  我们先花点时间
Okay, let's just hold off for a second

118
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,990
聊聊万维网是什么
on trying to talk about what the World Wide Web is

119
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,100
我们集中讨论它能做什么
and let's focus on what it could do.

120
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,690
好了  背景是这样的
Okay, so, here's some context.

121
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,790
我们假设这些是大巨头
Let's say these are the big boys,

122
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,250
我们所熟知的围墙花园
the walled gardens we're all familiar with.

123
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,390
比如天才  计算机服务
You've got your Prodigy, CompuServe,

124
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,190
美国在线服务
your America Online--

125
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,610
美国在线服务
America Online.

126
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,330
这是哪门子的名字
What kind of name is that, anyways?

127
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,180
听上去就像是尼尔·戴蒙德的歌
It sounds like a Neil Diamond song.

128
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,290
*我们来到了美国...在线*
*We're coming to America... Online!*

129
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,680
好了  还有国家科学基金网
Okay, and then we've got NSFNET.

130
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,660
伯纳斯·李在这篇论文中提出来的
Now, what Berners-Lee is proposing in this paper

131
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,050
是一个可以在网络的网络上
is an application that could

132
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,440
运行的应用
run on this network of networks.

133
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,580
国家科学基金网虽还不能用于商业用途
And now, well, NSFNET isn't for commercial use yet,

134
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,470
它一点也不性感
and it isn't, you know, sexy at all--

135
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,850
得了  国家科学基金网性感得流油
Hey, hey, come on. NSFNET's dripping with sex.

136
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,360
它的容量和范围令人敬畏
The size and scope of that would be formidable.

137
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,950
但它还是与围墙花园彻底隔绝
Still, it's completely separate from the walled gardens,

138
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,580
钱都在围墙花园那儿
where all the real money is.

139
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,400
现在  将这些网络联接起来
Right now, unifying all these networks

140
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,810
是根本不可能的
is essentially impossible.

141
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,880
他们的软件不同  协议不同
There's different software, different protocols,

142
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,820
基于不同硬件的不同操作系统
different operating system on different hardware.

143
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,370
但如果一个万维网这样的东西扩大
But if something like the World Wide Web expands,

144
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,100
最终就能做到
what it ultimately could do...

145
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,290
这样  没错吧
is this, right?

146
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,660
不对  不是的
Well, no, not really.

147
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,320
不是
No.

148
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,080
抱歉  我清楚你们没有邀请我
Sorry, I know I wasn't exactly invited.

149
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,290
可以吗
May I?

150
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,580
谢了
Thanks.

151
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,830
那好
Okay, uh...

152
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:01,150
如果我的理解无误
if I'm understanding this correctly,

153
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,630
会出现一种工具  能有办法
an implementation would somehow

154
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,760
让这些大规模在线网络
take these massive online networks

155
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,200
变成这样
and do this.

156
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,690
不  不对  你理解反了
No, no, you've got it backwards.

157
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,310
能把那个给我吗
Can you give me the thing?

158
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,340
好的
Good.

159
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,100
是这样  对吧
It's this, isn't it?

160
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,800
记住  万维网和国家科学基金网
Remember, the World Wide Web and NSFNET,

161
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,680
或者说因特网  随便你怎么叫吧
or the Internet, or whatever you want to call it,

162
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,250
是不同的两个东西
are two different things.

163
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,110
万维网是运行在因特网之上
The Web runs on top of the Internet.

164
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,410
它将一切都统一起来
It unifies everything.

165
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,850
将网络世界一体化
It makes it one network.

166
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,240
这才是其背后的惊人潜力
And that's the incredible potential behind something like this.

167
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,170
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}人类联合起来想兴建通天堂的巴别塔
为阻止该计划  上帝让人类语言不通而不能交流
罗赛达石是用三种语言刻了同一段诏书的石碑

168
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,540
目前的线上世界语言不通
Right now the online world is the Tower of Babel.

169
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,170
而这就是翻译机制
This is the Rosetta Stone.

170
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,090
在最先进的NeXT软硬件上运行
And it's running on state-of-the-art NeXT hardware and software.

171
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,230
那就是我最大的问题
That's my biggest problem.

172
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,140
NeXTSTEP不是问题  它很完美
NeXTSTEP is not a problem; it's perfect.

173
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,060
好吧  但我是做网络的
Okay, yeah, but I run a network

174
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,100
不是简单在白板上比划
that's not just on a whiteboard.

175
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,200
又来了
All right, here we go.

176
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,300
NeXT是最先进的系统
The NeXT is a state-of-the-art system.

177
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,430
其设计者乔布斯是个身败名裂的自大狂
Designed by a disgraced megalomaniac

178
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,040
他把外形看得比功能还重
who loves form over function.

179
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,410
难怪你喜欢NeXT
No wonder you love the NeXT.

180
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,750
听着  如果要说一个
Look, if we're talking about a network

181
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,390
只适用于一种与科技界其他产品
that lives exclusively on a ridiculously overpriced machine

182
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,920
都无法兼容的
that doesn't really play nice

183
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,020
天价机型的网络
with anything else in the technological landscape,

184
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,620
那么这其实是
what we're really looking at...

185
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,690
好吧  请
Well, please...

186
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,730
-是这样的  -尽管用
- Is this. - ...be my guest.

187
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,450
一座小小的荒岛
A tiny little desert island

188
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,500
根本没人在乎
that nobody gives a shit about.

189
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,230
卡梅伦  你怎么看
Cameron? What do you think?

190
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,780
好吧
Okay.

191
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,570
假如我们语言互通
Say we're all talking the same way.

192
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,440
好  我们说什么
Cool. What are we saying?

193
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,820
只是闲聊吗  玩游戏吗
Are we just shooting the breeze? Are we playing games?

194
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,090
找人打炮吗
Are we looking to get laid?

195
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,580
就漫无目的地购物吗
Are we just mindlessly shopping?

196
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,620
这点提的好
That's an excellent point.

197
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,550
内容很重要  但这盒子就相当于
Content is paramount, but this box is the equivalent

198
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,610
一个先进的五十万座体育场
of a 500,000-seat state-of-the-art stadium,

199
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,260
我们造出来  掌握在手里  就是胜利
and we build that, we own that, we win.

200
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,240
但是没有一个吸引人的乐队表演
But what's the point of having a giant stadium

201
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,310
要这么大的舞台又能干什么呢
if you don't have a kickass band to play the venue?

202
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,340
各位  现在我们最不需要的
Guys, the last thing that we need to do right now

203
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,260
就是着急上车
is hop in the car

204
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,410
冲去一个空荡荡的体育馆停车场
and race out to the parking lot of an empty stadium

205
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,310
听还没有发明的歌曲表演
before rock and roll is even invented.

206
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,600
各位  我们超前了
Hey, guys, we are early.

207
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,060
而且不只是"冲去国际薄烤饼店
And I'm not talking, "Let's all just run down to the IHOP

208
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,820
点一个银元薄煎饼"那么早
and grab some silver dollar pancakes" early.

209
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,260
我们的创意超前了太多年
We are years and years early on this.

210
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,170
相信我  好吗  我就是干这个的
Trust me, okay? This is what I do.

211
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,560
-你怎么能看不到  -我同意
- I can't believe you don't see this. - Look, I agree.

212
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,670
我同意互联网
Okay, the World Wide Web

213
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,110
也许是继切片面包之后最伟大的发明
could be the next best thing since sliced bread.

214
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,600
但现在  它还是一个运行在NeXT电脑上的
But right now, it's a tiny little academic petri dish

215
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,460
-学术研究实验  -在欧洲
- running on a NeXT computer. - In Europe.

216
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,520
-是的  在欧洲  -那我们还在干吗
- Yes, is Europe. - Then what exactly are we all doing here?

217
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,840
行了  等等
Okay, hold on, hold on.

218
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,620
别忘了已经达成的一致
Just-- let's not lose the shared idea here.

219
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,830
这是个共享协议  全球通用语言
There's a shared protocol. This is a universal language.

220
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,520
-世界语还全球通呢  -世界语又是啥
- So it's Esperanto. - What the heck is Esperanto?

221
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,350
是给学习不好的孩子的简单语言
It's a language for idiots that failed.

222
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,030
这样吧  我们休息一下吃个午饭吧
Okay, you know what? Let's-- why don't we take a break for lunch?

223
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,440
现在才10点30
It's, like, 10:30.

224
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,820
我可以吃点  好啊
I mean, I could eat. Sure.

225
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,290
戈登出去买披萨了
Gordon went out to get some pizza.

226
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,270
我想着你在日本肯定好久没吃到了
I figured maybe it'd been a while since you had that in Japan.

227
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,620
我们公寓转角就有家多米诺
There's a Domino's around the corner from our apartment.

228
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,050
你都大老远的来了
Look, you came all this way.

229
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,640
但是感觉你并不想待在这里
It just seems like you don't want to be here.

230
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,930
我不是说我会听听看吗
I said I'd listen.

231
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,230
唐娜  这又不是
Donna, it's not like this

232
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,790
我要在美国办的唯一一件事
is the only thing we're doing stateside.

233
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,490
我和雅达利还有约  汤姆还要见美国世嘉
I have a meeting with Atari. Tom has to meet with SEGA U.S.--

234
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,740
你还要和他家人在德州过圣诞  我知道
And you're doing Christmas in Texas with his family, I know.

235
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,380
卡梅  我们的安排就是照你的行程定的
Cam, we planned this whole thing around your travel.

236
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,280
在维加斯你还说这是个好主意
In Vegas you said this was a good idea.

237
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,680
是个好主意
It is a good idea.

238
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,720
但现实对它也有诸多限制
But is also has severe limitations in reality.

239
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,800
很高兴见到你  乔
It's good to see you, Joe.

240
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,710
谢谢
Thanks.

241
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,380
看到你过得很好我很高兴
It's good to see you doing so well.

242
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,180
-那你以为会是什么样  -不  只是
- As opposed to...? - No, it's just--

243
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,370
卡梅伦说  她说在分销商展览上
Cameron said-- she said at COMDEX you were--

244
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,410
你当时状态不太好  就这样
you were having a bit of a rough go of it, that's all.

245
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,930
那件事我很遗憾
I'm sorry to hear about what happened.

246
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,780
我没见过莱恩  但卡梅伦对他评价很高
I never met Ryan, but Cameron spoke really highly of him.

247
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,260
挺难熬的
It was difficult.

248
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,820
很长一段时间都是
For a long time.

249
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,450
但自从跟你妻子恢复了联系
But I'm doing so much better

250
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,680
我好了很多
since I've reconnected with your wife.

251
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,910
慢着
Hold on-- -

252
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,230
我觉得我们在绕圈子
I feel like we're talking in circles.

253
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,040
我们真正想要的是...
What we're really looking at is...

254
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,810
我想从另一个角度入手
You know, I'd like to take things in a different direction,

255
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,530
如果可以的话
if I could.

256
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,960
我想谈谈我在巴黎学到了什么
I'd like to talk about what I learned in Paris.

257
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,050
巴黎
Paris?

258
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,040
异想天开的哑剧表演吗
The whimsical art of mime?

259
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,400
几周前我去了超文本大会
I went to the Hypertext Conference a few weeks ago.

260
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,860
-什么会  -超文本
- The what conference? - Hypertext.

261
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,020
一些非常著名的公司也去了  苹果  施乐
Some pretty big names were there-- Apple, Xerox.

262
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,200
-你没听说我有点意外  -我也很意外
- I'm surprised you didn't hear about it. - Yeah, me, too.

263
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,010
就是我们在计算机分销商展见面之后的事
It was right after I saw you in COMDEX.

264
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,140
好  知道了  超文本大会
Okay, so, Hypertext Conference.

265
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,450
伯纳斯·李也去了
Berners-Lee was there

266
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,640
他和所有愿意听的人交谈
and he was talking to anyone who would listen.

267
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,930
他分享了全部的网页开发工具包  传输协议
He handed out the entire Web toolkit, the transfer protocol,

268
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,600
标记语言  服务器软件
the mark-up language, the server software,

269
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,370
所有的一切
everything.

270
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,690
-慢着  你见到他了  -那些你都拿到了
- Wait, you met him? - You have all of that?

271
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:49,150
-是啊  -怎么今天早上不说
- Yeah. - That would have been useful to know this morning, maybe.

272
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,930
超文本
What's so interesting

273
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,360
这样的编程语言的有趣之处就在于
about a programming language like Hypertext--

274
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,340
它根本就不是编程语言
It's not a programming language,

275
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,120
它只是文本  可以访问其他文本
it's just a text that accesses other texts.

276
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,350
其实我指的是HTML  超文本标记语言
Yes, I'm actually talking about HTML, the mark-up language.

277
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,040
它的有趣之处在于它简单
What's so interesting about it is its simplicity.

278
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,640
只凭一套非常基本的规则
With a very basic set of rules,

279
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,340
就能创建很多页信息  对象
you can create pages of information, objects,

280
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,760
等带宽提高  还能创建媒体
and eventually media when the bandwidth increases.

281
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,970
所以我追着CERN的人谈了谈
So, I cornered the guys at CERN.

282
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,080
不好意思  CERN是什么
Sorry, what is CERN?

283
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,990
CERN  欧洲核子研究委员会
CERN. European Organization for Nuclear Research.

284
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,300
好吧  核研究  我明白其中的关联了
Oh, right, nuclear research. Okay, I see the connection.

285
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,500
抱歉  我没听见"C"代表什么
Sorry, I'm not hearing the "C" Word in it.

286
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,520
没人理会他们
Nobody was paying any attention to them.

287
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,820
他们让我有点想起
In a way, they reminded me of

288
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,170
1981年计算机分销商展览上的戈登和唐娜
Gordon and Donna, COMDEX '81.

289
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,250
-可怜吗  -是不是帅爆了
- What, pathetic?  - Devastatingly handsome?

290
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,700
超前于时代的天才
Geniuses ahead of their time.

291
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,380
伯纳斯·李分发的手册中不光有HTML
Berners-Lee handed out guidebooks not only for HTML,

292
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,950
还有HTTP  超文本传输协议
but HTTP, the transfer protocol,

293
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,760
在潜在网络上
the call-and-response process for

294
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,160
传输信息的呼应过程
moving information like this across to potential networks.

295
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,780
寻址协议就是TCP/IP
Addressing protocol is TCP/IP.

296
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,610
但HTTP是抽象应用层协议
But HTTP is the abstraction application layer protocol

297
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,970
以协同方式在TCP/IP之上
that sits on top of TCP/IP symbiotically,

298
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,080
对吧  汤姆
right, Tom?

299
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,800
有了HTTP  任何一台机器都能做客户端
With HTTP, any machine can become a client,

300
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,790
每台电脑都可以当服务器  轻松交换文件
any machine can become a server, easily exchanging files.

301
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,220
不  文件传输是FTP
No, files are FTP,

302
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,100
也就是文件传输协议
as in File Transfer Protocol.

303
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,110
名字里本来就有"文件"俩字
It's the one that has "file" in the name of it.

304
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,940
我是说HTTP会最终取代FTP
What I am saying is HTTP will eventually supplant FTP.

305
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,530
我的意思是它是全能的
What I'm saying is it can do it all.

306
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,400
这个说法有趣
That's interesting.

307
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,070
不是吧  FTP还有趣
Really? FTP? That's interesting?

308
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,620
我想再次强调非常重要的一点
I'd like to get back to an important point--

309
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,420
简洁性
simplicity.

310
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,460
HTML和HTTP都极致简洁
Both HTML and HTTP are breathtakingly simple.

311
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,010
而这种简洁让它用途广泛
And this kind of elegance allows for versatility,

312
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,700
具有通用性
it allows for universality--

313
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,590
没错  就像我说的  一种通用语言
Yes, a universal language, like I said.

314
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,500
而最妙的一点就是在线目录查看器
And the best part is, the online catalogue viewer,

315
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,530
传输协议和网页伺服器软件
the transfer protocol, the Web server software,

316
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,900
全部都是免费的
all of it is free.

317
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,280
我不赞成开源
I have a problem with open source.

318
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,050
-你不赞成  -没错
- You do? - Yeah, I do.

319
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,310
你知道我手上每天要过多少份
Do you know how many bad video game pitches

320
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,560
糟糕的电子游戏方案吗
I sit through every single day?

321
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,730
世嘉和任天堂长期保持水准的原因  
The only way SEGA stays SEGA, or Nintendo stays Nintendo,

322
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,580
就是不让这些破烂游戏上市
is by not turning those pitches into products.

323
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,880
-这不是...  -不  不
- That's not-- - No, no.

324
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,910
因为开放源码
Because open source

325
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,520
就相当于让病人自己管理疯人院
allows the lunatics to run the asylum.

326
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,090
而每次  每一次
And every time-- every time--

327
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,840
你向世界推出精心编写的代码
you put well-made code out into the world,

328
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,080
放任阿猫阿狗拿来折腾
for people to screw around with,

329
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,870
就会产生极大的问题
it causes major problems.

330
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,540
你看看麦克米伦实用网络的事就知道了
I mean, just look what happened to MacMillan Utility.

331
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,130
-你说什么呢  -怎么了
- What are you doing? - What?

332
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,750
麦克米伦实用网络怎么了
What happened to MacMillan Utility?

333
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,090
天啊  源代码被发布到网上
Gee. The release of their source code online

334
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,290
股东的千万投资一夜蒸发
vaporized millions of shareholder dollars.

335
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,840
-长话短说  就是你出局了  -好了
- And, long story short, you're not around anymore. - Okay!

336
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,750
或者你也可以换个角度来看
Or you could look at it a different way.

337
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,070
如果大家能一起来创造万维网这样的东西
That with everyone creating something like the Web together,

338
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,190
也许会催生出非常了不起的结果
some potentially amazing things could happen.

339
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,460
首先  建设速度非常快
One, it gets built very fast.

340
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,620
其次  规模上也非常巨大
Two, it becomes huge in size.

341
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,630
第三  会不停地被人编辑优化
Three, it's constantly being edited and refined,

342
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,470
所以其升级速度也非常快
so it's improving at a massive rate.

343
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,150
第四  也不会有什么控制一切的霸主
And four, there's no overlord controlling things.

344
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,000
那你说的这个
And what network

345
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,450
浩瀚璀璨的协作网要在什么网络上运行呢
is this giant, miraculous nebula of collaboration happening on?

346
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,230
你和我都清楚这样的事
You know as well as I do that something like this

347
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,730
会极大改变因特网的面貌
could change the face of the Internet.

348
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,530
因特网现在还不能开放商用
The Internet is not available for commercial use.

349
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,420
你知道我投了多少钱给游说公司
Do you know how much money I poured into lobbying,

350
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,070
想尽快撤掉网络管制吗
trying to get deregulation through?

351
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:01,000
大家都盼着这事  而早晚也会撤掉
Look, everybody wants this and it's gonna happen eventually.

352
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,190
但我们赶得太早  而时机至关重要
But we are early, and it's all about timing.

353
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,740
如果时机不对  我们就完了
If the timing's off, we're dead.

354
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,400
穆特尼就败在了时机不对上
Timing's what killed Mutiny.

355
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,720
-时机才不是穆特尼失败的原因  -抱歉
- Timing didn't kill Mutiny. - I'm sorry...

356
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,420
英雄也可以造时势
The right people make it the right time.

357
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,370
我们完全可以推动这个
We can move this forward.

358
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,850
我们完全可以当那群创造未来的人
We can be the people that make that future happen.

359
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,580
-天啊  -怎么了
- Oh, my God. - What?

360
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,700
我听这套未来的说辞都听恶心了
I'm so sick of hearing about the future.

361
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,760
那到底是什么玩意  所谓未来
What is that? The future

362
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,240
无非就是一个糟心版的现在
is just another crappy version of the present.

363
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,980
人们编了这套好听的话
It's some bribe people offer you

364
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,440
哄着你违逆自己的心意  去干他们想做的事
to make you do what they want instead of what you want.

365
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,910
这一次  未来会有不同
This future can be different.

366
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,840
我的天  你该把这句话写在名片上  乔
Oh, Jesus, that should be on your business card, Joe.

367
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,920
你们还要上这句话多少次的当
How many times are you people gonna fall for this?

368
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,110
我同意乔
You know, I'm with Joe.

369
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,590
虽然我不相信我会这么说  但我支持乔
I can't believe I'm saying that, but I'm with Joe.

370
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,870
你当然支持乔  你们俩都是投钱的
Of course you're with Joe. You guys are the money people.

371
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,980
而我和卡梅伦才是实打实动手干的人
But it's me and Cameron that actually have to do it.

372
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,770
-可是现在什么都还没做  -没错
- Look, nobody's doing anything yet-- - Exactly.

373
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,380
几位  今天聊得很愉快
Yeah, uh, guys, it's been fun,

374
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,090
但我们得赶路去了
but I think we're gonna hit the road.

375
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,690
是啊  今天说得  很深入
Yeah, it's been, uh, thorough.

376
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,770
也行  那今天就这样  我们明早再碰头
Yeah, okay, we can call it a day and reconvene in the morning.

377
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,320
没准
Well, you know, maybe--

378
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,600
没准明天会好些
maybe tomorrow will go better.

379
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,570
明天他们不会来了
There's not gonna be a tomorrow.

380
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,080
卡梅伦
Hey, Cameron?

381
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:45,970
明天再来吧
Come back tomorrow.

382
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,640
你们从地球那边飞过来
You flew halfway across the world.

383
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,940
唐娜也在尽力  给她一个机会吧
Donna's trying. Just give her a chance.

384
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,020
乔
Joe...

385
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,930
我们得看看到底能不能成
We got to see if there's something here.

386
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,120
这就是一团乱  乔
This is a mess, Joe.

387
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,890
就是一团乱
It's just a mess.

388
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,340
拜托
Come on, now.

389
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,280
申请登船
Permission to come aboard?

390
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,370
允许登船
Permission granted.

391
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,980
-皮鞋要当心  -抱歉
- Careful there with them city shoes. - Oh, sorry.

392
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,960
你最好先适应适应  别晕船了
Might wanna wait a sec till you get your sea legs under you.

393
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,220
没事的
That's all right.

394
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,430
船不错
Cool boat.

395
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,560
不过车道上开不起来吧
Hard to sail in a driveway, though.

396
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,960
我上个月驾着船
Well, I was beating that slot

397
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,790
想穿过天使岛和金门大桥之间的海沟
up between Angel Island and Golden Gate last month,

398
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,490
在浅水区转弯不够快
and I didn't heel fast enough in the shallows

399
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,300
结果刮了好大一块漆皮下去
and I scratched the shit out of my gelcoat.

400
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,580
瞧瞧你
Well, look at you!

401
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,420
成老水手了
The salty sailor.

402
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,220
也瞧瞧你
Look at you.

403
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,910
嗯  我知道  真成大人了  对吧
Yeah, I know. Just all grown up, right?

404
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:46,670
其实  卡梅伦
Well, hell, Cameron,

405
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,900
在我认识你之前你已经是大人了
you were all grown up before I ever met you.

406
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,450
-啤酒  -好
- Beer? - Yeah.

407
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,110
今早上跟唐娜如何
How'd it go this morning with Donna?

408
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,030
你怎么
How did you...?

409
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:02,990
黛安跟我说了
Oh, Diane told me.

410
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,340
你以为这是谁家的车道
Whose driveway you think you're in?

411
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,270
黛安如何
How is Diane?

412
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,090
她还好  还好
She's good. Good.

413
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,580
-你们还...  -是啊
- Yeah? You guys are still-- - Yup.

414
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,340
她还在上班  我仍是退休赋闲
She still goes to work and I stay retired.

415
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,940
我们有的周末启航去索萨利托或蒂布龙
Some weekends we sail up to Sausalito or Tiburon.

416
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,660
如果时间充裕  通常会去葡萄园
Mostly go to the vineyard if we got a couple of extra days.

417
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,700
真是加州范儿
So Californian.

418
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,010
你带她去过德州吗
You take her to Texas yet?

419
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,580
去过
I have, yeah.

420
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,770
她喜欢牛仔比赛  其他都讨厌
Loved the rodeo. Hated everything else.

421
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,860
我觉得她说喜欢牛仔比赛也只是客气
And I think she was just being polite about the rodeo.

422
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:42,110
那下一步呢  办婚礼吗
So, what's next? Wedding bells?

423
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,710
我们当然商量过  但还是算了
Oh, sure, we've talked about it, but, no.

424
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,020
见鬼  我们加起来有三个孩子
Hell, between us we got three kids

425
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,150
介于14至35岁  够了
aged 35 to 14, and that's enough.

426
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,020
老汤米·兰顿怎么样
Hey, how's old Tommy Rendon?

427
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,760
准备要孩子了吗
Kids on the radar for you yet?

428
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,010
没
Ooh, no.

429
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,450
不  我
No, I--

430
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,190
汤姆想要  但
Tom wants them, but...

431
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:02,920
算了  如果要我决定
No. If it was up to me,

432
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,530
不如从自动贩卖机买
we'd just get them out of a vending machine

433
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,140
日本买东西都这样
like everything else in Japan.

434
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,390
-比如  -可食用内衣
- Like what? - Uh... edible underwear.

435
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,590
-不会吧  -是啊
- Come on! - Yeah.

436
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,370
再说  我们现在离家太远了
Plus, you know, we're just so far from home these days.

437
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,430
不过究竟什么才算是家呢
Although, what the hell is home anymore?

438
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,300
你现在在这儿  不是吗
Well, you're here now, ain't ya?

439
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,110
对  我在这儿
Yeah, I'm here.

440
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,220
我只用了24小时
It only took me 24 hours

441
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,870
就意识到不该回来
to realize that coming back was a mistake.

442
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,340
唐娜说那个点子很棒
Well, Donna says it's a pretty hot idea.

443
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:38,430
让你们都重聚一堂了  肯定很棒
Had to be to get all you yokels in the same room again.

444
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,420
确实  只是
It is. It's just...

445
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,790
人多误事
too many cooks.

446
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,040
耍我两次  是我笨了
Fool me twice, right?

447
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,350
是这样吗
Was that what happened?

448
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,980
你被耍了
You got fooled?

449
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,510
再说我还有
And also I just have

450
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,380
自己的事要忙  所以
my own thing going on that I'm busy with, so...

451
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,580
对  《太空摩托》
Yeah. Space Bike.

452
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:05,690
对
Yeah.

453
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,080
没错  我买了  我玩过了
That's right, I got it. I tried it out.

454
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,230
-是吗  -好吧
- Really? - Well, look--

455
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,290
不适合我
Well, it's not for me.

456
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,660
你安装了就够让我惊讶了
I am just amazed that you even installed it.

457
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,150
说实话  我真是搞不懂
I couldn't make heads or tails of it, to tell you the truth.

458
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:22,710
那个拿电锯的小混蛋是谁
Well, who's that little bastard with the chainsaw?

459
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,090
那是谁啊
Who's that one?

460
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,240
还有那个力场
And then you got the force field thing.

461
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,530
感觉根本赢不了啊
Hell, it's like you can't even win.

462
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,610
不能
Nope.

463
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,870
你赢不了
No, you can't.

464
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,200
抱歉  我来拿海莉的牙套
Sorry, I'm just here for Haley's retainer.

465
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,110
她又恰巧忘了
She conveniently forgot it again.

466
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,600
我在楼上看到了
Yeah, I think I saw it upstairs.

467
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,870
你是要我...我可以上...
Oh, did you want me to-- 'cause I can go--

468
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,850
不是  我去拿吧  进
No, no, I can get it. Come on in.

469
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,240
我
You know, I, uh...

470
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:04,260
每晚都还睡楼上
still sleep up there every night.

471
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,670
你要不自己倒杯葡萄酒
Hey, why don't you get yourself a glass of wine?

472
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,890
你看着需要喝一杯
You look like you could use one.

473
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,780
你知道在哪儿的
You know where it is.

474
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,970
浓汤制作的关键在于帕玛森干酪面包
The key to the bisque is the Parmesan toast.

475
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,420
四年前你还只知道帕玛森干酪粉
Four years ago, the only Parmesan you knew about was powdered.

476
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,500
嗯  我还有呢
Yeah, well, I still got that, too.

477
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
琼妮用勺舀着吃
Joanie eats it by the spoonful.

478
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,940
告诉你个小秘密
Dirty little secret?

479
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,080
十几岁女孩子跟同龄男孩一样惹人厌
Teenage girls are just as disgusting as teenage boys.

480
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,820
你有看到
Well, have you seen this thing

481
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,580
她拿巧克力糖浆干的事了吗
that she does with the chocolate syrup?

482
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,190
还有牛奶  真过分
And the milk? It's atrocious.

483
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,150
我的天
Oh, my God.

484
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,620
对  说到奶酪
Yeah, speaking of cheese,

485
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,990
乔·麦克米伦似乎又回到最佳状态了
seems like Joe MacMillan is back in rare form.

486
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,650
是啊  你去唤醒了那只野兽
Yes, you've gone and woken up the beast.

487
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,810
只有那样才能打动卡梅伦
Well, it was my only way to get to Cameron.

488
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,250
本就希望渺茫  而且也没奏效
It was a long shot and it didn't even work.

489
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,700
我只能自己去
I had to go myself.

490
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,560
我说不准  或许那样也没用
I don't know, maybe that didn't even work either.

491
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,180
你这些年还能怎么办
Yeah, well, what were you gonna do all these years, you know?

492
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,330
应付工作  照顾小孩
Between work and the kids?

493
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,640
难道能搭飞机去东京吗
You know, get on a plane and fly to Tokyo?

494
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,910
我可以向汤姆推销糟糕的电子游戏
Well, I could pitch a terrible video game to Tom.

495
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,780
不  不  不
No, no, no.

496
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,310
你根本没机会见到汤姆那么重要的人
You would never get a meeting with someone as important as Tom.

497
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,340
-如果明天他们真回来  -嗯
- You know, if they do come back tomorrow... - Yeah?

498
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,450
我准备了一个很棒的点子
I got this really great idea for them.

499
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,800
-说说看  -电子游戏点子
- Yeah, what's that? - For a video game.

500
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,700
就是一条传送带
Basically, it's this conveyor belt

501
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,130
上面全是电灯泡[点子]
filled with all these light bulbs,

502
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,770
要赶在它们点亮之前在上边拉屎[吐槽]
but you have to shit on them before they turn on.

503
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,660
我有个完美的标题
Wait, I have the perfect title.

504
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,710
听听看
Ready?

505
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,130
"你是个屁眼"[混蛋]
"You're an Asshole."

506
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,420
听我说
Listen, I--

507
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,010
很抱歉今天我说你是投钱的
I apologize today for calling you a money person.

508
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,440
我不是那个意思
I didn't mean it.

509
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,130
就是冲口而出
It just kind of came out.

510
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,850
但没说错
It's true, though.

511
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,440
现如今...
These days.

512
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,900
说不好  或许就是个错误
I don't know, maybe it was a mistake--

513
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,200
把大家聚在一起  想要修复一切
bringing everybody back together and trying to fix things.

514
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,870
如果明天没人来  我还是感兴趣的
Yeah, well, if nobody shows up tomorrow, I'm still interested.

515
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,690
真的  你今天不像是感兴趣
Really? It didn't seem like that today.

516
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:24,430
什么...我只是说  你太早了
What the-- all I said was, you're early.

517
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,560
我不说对大家没好处
Okay, it's a disservice to everyone if I didn't say that.

518
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,240
而且
You know, and look, I've--

519
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,940
我也错过
I've been wrong before.

520
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,090
我会第一个承认的
I'll be the first to admit that.

521
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:40,050
能问你个奇怪的问题吗
Can I ask you a weird question?

522
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,580
说吧
Yeah, shoot.

523
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,450
你现如今经常做爱吗
Are you having just a ton of sex these days?

524
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,460
我还行吧
I do all right.

525
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,490
你呢
How about you?

526
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,040
嗯  也是
Yeah. Same.

527
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,350
你
Are you--

528
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,470
现在有跟谁约会吗
are you seeing anyone right now?

529
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,740
没有
Nope.

530
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,350
很好
Good.

531
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,200
因为我有个奇怪的问题
'Cause there's something really weird I want to ask you.

532
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,320
你愿意...
Would you be open to...

533
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,830
见见谁吗
meeting someone?

534
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,800
约会那种
Like, for a date?

535
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,780
我觉得有个人跟你会很合得来
I think you and this guy would really hit it off.

536
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,510
什么
What?

537
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,000
是啊  我认识个很不错的人
Yeah, there's this really great guy I know.

538
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:43,090
他在加大负责一个电脑实验室项目
He runs the computer lab programs at Cal.

539
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,970
他非常好  我觉得
He's really nice and I just thought,

540
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,590
你也单身  他也是
you're free, he's free...

541
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,560
我也不知道
I don't know.

542
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,120
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

543
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,080
我想完成讲演稿
I'm trying to finish this presentation.

544
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,290
但我电池耗尽了  所以我用你的
My battery died, so I'm using yours.

545
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,700
没事吧
Is that okay?

546
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:29,830
没事
Yeah, it's fine.

547
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,830
博斯怎么样了
How's Bos?

548
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,120
挺好的
Yeah, he's good.

549
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,510
听着
Oh, look...

550
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,410
我知道你今天不怎么开心
I know today wasn't fun for you,

551
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,370
明天如果你不想  就不用再去了
so if you don't want to come back tomorrow, you don't have to.

552
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:47,830
你还要去
So, you're going?

553
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,040
嗯
Well...

554
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,050
是啊
Yeah, I guess so.

555
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,600
那我也去
Okay, well, I guess I'm going, too.

556
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,760
好啊
Good.

557
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,200
我去洗澡
Let me get in the shower.

558
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,670
他是怎么了
What's up with him?

559
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,550
他说他需要五分钟
He says he needs five minutes.

560
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,240
我今早起来头好疼
Man, did I wake up with a headache this morning.

561
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,670
你昨晚离开得好快
Hey, you left kind of fast last night.

562
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,490
希望我没说什么蠢话
I hope I didn't say anything dumb.

563
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:10,020
约会的事
You know, about the date.

564
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,180
戈登  没事的
Gordon, it's fine.

565
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,260
好啊  那就好
Oh, great. I mean, you know, good.

566
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,360
把他的号码给我吧
I'd love his number.

567
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,900
除非...你会觉得别扭
Unless, you know-- if it would be weird...

568
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,380
不
No.

569
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,440
不会
No, I mean...

570
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,080
没问题
Yeah, no problem.

571
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,140
你来了
Oh, you're here.

572
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,050
你们都来了
You're all here.

573
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:45,720
我们开始吧
Let's get started.

574
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,420
伯纳斯·李编写HTML是为浏览  编辑万维网
Berners-Lee wrote HTML to view and edit the Web,

575
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,730
编写HTTP是为了网络内部沟通
HTTP so that it could talk to itself.

576
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,410
通信网络可能嘈杂混乱
The chatter could be cacophonous.

577
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,460
也可能寂静无声
It could be deafeningly silent.

578
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:01,760
看大局  万维网会成为什么
Big picture-- what will the World Wide Web become?

579
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,390
简单回答  谁知道呢
Short answer-- who knows?

580
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,170
你想说什么
Okay, so, what's your point?

581
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,640
去设想万维网会成为什么样子
It's a waste of time to try to figure out

582
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,870
根本是浪费时间  我们不可能知道
what the Web will become. We just don't know.

583
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,340
因为现在  说到底
Because right now, at the end of the day,

584
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,460
它还是线上的学术研究目录
it's just an online research catalogue

585
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,090
只在NeXT上运行
running on NeXT computers

586
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,400
还局限于欧洲的小范围网络
on a small network in Europe.

587
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,990
那么你是说  我们来之后
So, you're saying everything we've talked about

588
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,570
说的一切都是浪费时间
since we got here has been a waste of time?

589
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:24,190
我是说  我们后退一步
I'm saying, let's take a step back.

590
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:28,030
真正的退后一步
Literally, a step back.

591
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,390
你在板子上写的是什么
Yeah, but what is this on the board?

592
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,920
是浏览器的代码
It's the code for the Web browser.

593
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,700
你给写在白板上了
And you wrote it all on the whiteboard.

594
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,830
线上学术研究目录
The online catalogue of research?

595
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,150
全是挪威人  物理论文
Full of Norwegian dudes, physics papers,

596
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,660
和粒子图表什么的吗
and particle diagrams and stuff?

597
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,690
我们为什么在意这个
Yeah, and we care about this because why?

598
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,330
我们怎么走到今天的
How did we all get here today?

599
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,550
我们做的决定
The choices we made,

600
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,470
我们的意志吗
the sheer force of our will, something like that?

601
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,490
还有一个答案  命运的吹动
Here's another answer-- the winds of fate.

602
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:56,110
随机巧合  无形之手推着我们前进
Random coincidence, some unseen hand just pushing us along.

603
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,440
宿命
Destiny.

604
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,920
我们今天怎么走进来的
How did we all get here today?

605
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,210
我们走过这扇门
We walked through this door.

606
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,270
我们不用建个大白盒子或体育场
We don't have to build a big white box or a stadium,

607
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,860
或是发明摇滚乐
or invent rock and roll.

608
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,430
我们一旦对万维网有特定的定义  就输了
The moment we decide what the Web is, we've lost.

609
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,430
我们如果想教别人拿它怎么办
The moment we try to tell people what to do with it,

610
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,630
就输了
we've lost.

611
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,470
我们只需要
All we have to do

612
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,600
建一扇门
is build a door

613
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,880
让他们进来
and let them inside.

614
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,270
我五岁时
When I was five,

615
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,800
我母亲带我去城里
my mother took me to the city.

616
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,570
我们穿过荷兰隧道  它很简单
And we went through the Holland Tunnel, and it was basic.

617
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,480
钢筋混凝土
Concrete and steel.

618
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,410
但我坐在后座  兴奋无比
But it was also my excitement sitting in the backseat,

619
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:43,670
不知什么时候轮到我们走出隧道
wondering when it was going to be our turn to emerge.

620
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:46,090
阳光像爆炸一样
It was the explosion of sunlight.

621
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,070
我们出了隧道时
And when we exited the tunnel,

622
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,530
曼哈顿全部展现在我们眼前
all of Manhattan was laid out before us.

623
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,350
那就是旅行最棒的部分
And that was the best part of the trip--

624
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,800
在一个了不起  没有尽头的东西里
the amazing possibility to be able to go anywhere

625
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,530
有无尽探索的可能
within something that is magnificent and never-ending.

626
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,300
这是第一个浏览器
This is the first Web browser,

627
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,560
CERN为审阅编辑研究建造的基本版本
the rudimentary one CERN built to view and edit research.

628
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,280
我写出来就是为了让你们看它多简单
I wrote it up here for you to see how simple it is.

629
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,530
只需要一块白板  这就是基本的钢筋混凝土
It takes up one whiteboard-- that's basic concrete and steel.

630
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:20,420
但我们可以拿它建造一扇门
But we can take this and we can build a door,

631
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:23,070
我们可以成为最早做的人
and we can be the first ones to do it.

632
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,920
因为现在  其他人都把它
Because right now, everyone else sees this as--

633
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,090
视为在线研究目录
As an online research catalogue.

634
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,760
在NeXT上运行
Running on NeXT.

635
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,570
在欧洲的一个网络上
On a network in Europe.

636
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,890
有了这些代码  我们就能建荷兰隧道
And with this handful of code, we can build the Holland Tunnel.

637
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,540
我看不出
I don't see it.

638
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,480
我看不出  它是门  还是隧道
I don't. I mean, is it a door, or is it a tunnel?

639
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,510
还是巴别塔
Or is it the Tower of Babel?

640
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,080
还是罗赛达石  还是体育场
Or is it a Rosetta Stone, or is it a stadium?

641
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,980
你连隐喻都决定不了
You can't even decide on a metaphor.

642
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,270
如果浏览器是最重要的点子
And if the big idea here is the browser,

643
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:00,240
而且它那么容易搭建  那就不是个好点子
and it's that easy to build, then it's not a big idea at all.

644
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,720
是定局
It's a foregone conclusion.

645
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:06,060
而且这我们怎么能赢
And how can we win at something when anyone--

646
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,150
任何人  包括施乐  苹果
anyone, including Xerox and Apple

647
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,260
和超文本盛事上那些真正的玩家
and all the actual players from your little Hypertext shindig,

648
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,430
都随时能进来  碾压我们
can step in at any moment and crush us?

649
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,600
它是有竞争力的
It will be competitive,

650
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,350
把着门的人可以收入场费
because whoever owns the door can charge admission.

651
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,160
但我真心相信  有了这间屋子里的人
But I sincerely believe that with the people in this room,

652
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,690
我们有机会建造最好的...
we have a chance to build the best--

653
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,390
而且你凭什么认为
And what makes you think

654
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,640
这屋子里的人都会听你的  乔
you have all the people in this room, Joe?

655
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,580
走吧  卡梅  我们走
Come on, Cam, let's go.

656
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,000
走吧  卡梅  我们走
Come on, Cam. Let's go.

657
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,100
我们废话少说  汤姆
Let's cut the bullshit, Tom.

658
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,030
你不是对这个点子不满
Your problem isn't the idea.

659
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,060
是啊  乔
You're right, Joe.

660
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,550
知道我对什么不满吗
Do you know what my problem is?

661
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,120
我不希望卡梅伦最终像莱恩一样
I don't want to see Cameron end up like Ryan.

662
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:58,780
汤姆
Tom!

663
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,800
你再敢说一次他的名字
You say his name one more time--

664
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,630
莱恩  你记得他吗
Ryan. Do you remember him?

665
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,780
幸好  配偶没有投票权
Well, hey, lucky for us, wives don't get a vote.

666
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,620
你
You--

667
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,610
天啊
Oh, my God.

668
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,460
汤姆
Tom!

669
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,800
乔
Joe!

670
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:33,930
乔
Joe?!

671
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,220
快去
Go!

672
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,300
我知道  你没死算走运了
I know. You're lucky you're not dead.

673
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,730
乔  如果我们还有一丝机会
Listen, Joe, if we have any chance in hell at this,

674
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,280
这种私人问题
it's this kind of personal bullshit

675
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,210
会让我们根本没机会开始
that's going to sink us before we even start.

676
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,030
我们
Us?

677
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,550
是啊  卡梅伦说得对
Yeah, Cameron was right.

678
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,280
根本没有所谓未来  是吧
There's no such thing as the future, hey?

679
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,510
只有现在
All there is is now.

680
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,170
或许我们没有太早
Maybe we're not early.

681
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,420
或许如果我们现在做  就能做第一个
Maybe if we do it now, we could be the first.

682
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:20,100
不管怎样  我不想再等了
Regardless, I am done waiting.

683
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,090
我不能放过这次机会
I can't let this one get away.

684
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,190
那就别
Then don't.

685
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,630
他没事
Hey, he's fine.

686
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,810
他手腕断了  但没事
He broke his wrist, but he's okay.

687
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,930
计算机分销商展览上发生了什么
What happened at COMDEX?

688
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,480
什么  没什么啊
What? Nothing.

689
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,790
没发生什么
Nothing happened.

690
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,330
我需要透口气
I need some air.

691
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,400
你没事吧
You okay?

692
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,680
怪乔是那么简单
So easy to make Joe the bad guy.

693
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,240
我是说
I mean...

694
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,770
把他视作坏人  他就承担责任了
making him the villain takes the blame away,

695
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,710
但所有跟他有关的事
but in everything that's happened with him,

696
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,860
每一次
every single time...

697
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:58,000
我也是有错的
I deserve some of the blame, too.

698
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:09,110
跟你也是一样的
And it's the same with you, you know?

699
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,490
我们不欢而散
Things fell apart.

700
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,770
你做了你做的
And you did what you did,

701
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:18,990
但我也有很大的错
but a lot of it was my fault.

702
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,580
这是个很棒的点子
This is a really cool idea.

703
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,950
是啊  我也觉得
Yeah, I think so, too!

704
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,220
听着  如果乔对你是个问题
And, look, if Joe is a problem for you,

705
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,490
那他不非得在这儿的
then he doesn't have to be here.

706
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,790
我们可以摆脱他
We can get rid of him.

707
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,950
都接上了吗
We all patched in?

708
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,920
嗯  试试吧
Yeah, give it a try.

709
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,970
进去了  速度很好
Yup, we're in, good and speedy.

710
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,120
这就是你的宝贝
So, this is your baby, huh?

711
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,220
嗯  厉害的小网络
Yeah, the little network that could.

712
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,270
NeXT的数字信号处理器挺厉害
The DSP in this cube is amazing.

713
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,920
不仅有56k速
Not only are we getting clean 56K,

714
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,190
还能同时干这个
we can do this at the same time.

715
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,580
听上去不错吧
Sounds pretty good, huh?

716
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,690
是光驱播放的吗
Yeah, is that coming off the CD-ROM?

717
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,780
我们该集中注意力了
We should really focus.

718
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,770
好了  从国家科学基金网能接到CERN上
Okay, so through NSFNET, we can connect to CERN?

719
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,660
对  但到了欧洲就得爬了
Yes, but we're gonna crawl once we jump to Europe.

720
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,540
为什么  TAT8通信电缆是光纤
Why? The TAT-8 is fiber optic.

721
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,860
但它埋在大陆架下面
Yeah, but it's also buried along the continental shelf

722
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,340
一直有鲨鱼袭击
and constantly being attacked by sharks.

723
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,540
据说是它们能感应到电辐射
Apparently, they can sense the electrical radiation.

724
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,240
是啊
I know.

725
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,250
我爱你的大脑
I love your mind.

726
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,560
七千一个还是太贵
You know, seven grand a pop is still insane,

727
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,390
而且不知道为什么要用镁做
and I don't know why the cube is magnesium,

728
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,320
但我还是喜欢好机器
but I still appreciate a good machine.

729
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,410
是啊
Yeah, well...

730
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,620
人说  软件来来去去
you know what they say, software comes and goes...

731
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,350
硬件恒久远
But hardware is forever.

732
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,140
好了  都带好了吧
Okay. Do you have everything?

733
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,510
嗯
Yeah.

734
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,160
好  这很好
Okay, this is good. This is good.

735
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,920
我今天把会都开完
Yeah, I'll knock out my meetings today

736
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,200
早点回去
and get in a few days early,

737
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,170
见见家人  适应一下
I'll see the family, get my bearings.

738
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:26,070
应该能帮我缓过来
I think-- I think it will help me recalibrate.

739
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,620
嗯  这样很好
Yeah, this is good.

740
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,620
嗯  我后天去
Yeah, and I'll pick you up at the airport

741
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,470
机场接你
day after tomorrow, okay?

742
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,000
-我会去的  -好
- I'll be there. - Okay.

743
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,310
等等
Wait, um...

744
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,970
很抱歉我没相信你
I'm really sorry that I didn't trust you.

745
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,780
我不喜欢我这周末的样子
I don't like who I've been this weekend.

746
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,310
我也觉得很奇怪
It's been a weird situation for me, too.

747
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,590
那天晚上在旅馆
The other night at the hotel,

748
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,400
我是在用你的电脑看你的电邮
I was reading your emails on your laptop.

749
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,320
我真不敢相信我那么做了
I can't believe that I did that.

750
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,780
我就是忍不住不去想乔
I just couldn't get Joe out of my head,

751
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,440
那非常不理智  我很抱歉
and it was completely irrational and I'm sorry.

752
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,770
我不希望我们对彼此撒谎
I just-- don't want us to lie to one another.

753
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,480
因为我爱你
Because I love you.

754
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,060
我也爱你
I love you, too.

755
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,990
-好  -好
- Okay. - Okay.

756
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,100
乔
Joe...

757
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,320
乔  我...
Joe, I am...

758
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:06,030
乔  我想再次为昨天的事道歉
Joe, I-- I just wanted to apologize again for yesterday.

759
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,100
我的行为
The way I behaved...

760
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:11,960
我太过分了
I was way, way, way out of line.

761
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:15,110
我也过分了
I was out of line, too.

762
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:20,700
抱歉
Sorry.

763
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,460
-我爱你  -我爱你
- I love you. - Love you.

764
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,850
-回见  -嗯
- I'll see you. - Okay.

765
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,410
楼下准备好了
Hey, they're ready downstairs.

766
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,090
唐娜
Donna...

767
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,540
我不能跟你合作
I can't work with you.

768
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,490
什么
What?

769
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,230
我不能跟你合作
I can't work with you.

770
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:21,400
不可能回到从前了
It will never be like it was.

771
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,830
不可能了
It can't be.

772
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:31,700
但昨晚  我们还谈了
But last night, we-- we talked.

773
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,730
还好好的
It was good.

774
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:35,040
我不明白
I don't understand.

775
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,160
知道我为什么要在这里见面吗
You know why I wanted us to meet here?

776
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:45,230
我不想忘记发生的事
I just didn't want to forget what had happened,

777
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:49,170
以及那多么痛苦
how painful that was.

778
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:50,330
为什么
Why?

779
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:54,160
我昨晚差点忘了
And then I almost did forget last night

780
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:57,440
我们谈时  感觉很好
when we talked, when it felt good,

781
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,070
我的朋友又回来了
when I was with my friend again.

782
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:03,210
然后你提醒了我
And then you reminded me

783
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,410
你多轻易就抛弃别人
how easily you toss people aside

784
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,200
只要你觉得他们挡了你的路
when you feel like they're in your way.

785
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:11,480
你是为了乔
This about Joe.

786
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:15,190
不  是你
No, this is about you.

787
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:16,510
天呐
Jesus!

788
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,610
我是想帮你
I was trying to help you.

789
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:23,660
我一直都只想帮你
All I was ever trying to do was help you.

790
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,170
好吧
Well...

791
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,110
问题是  唐娜
the thing is, Donna,

792
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:34,750
我喜欢这个项目
I love this project...

793
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,270
我想好好开发它
and I want to work on it.

794
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:47,840
拿走吧
Take it.

795
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,100
拿走吧
Take it.

796
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,860
该死
Damn it.

797
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,090
是我  我这就去办公室
It's me. I'm headed to the office.

798
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:18,800
我要飞去瑞士
I need a flight to Switzerland

799
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,870
等我到了要见CERN
and I need to meet with CERN when I get there.

800
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:43,020
卡梅伦呢
Where the hell is Cameron?

801
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:46,860
你知道这四年
You know how long I've been waiting,

802
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:50,550
我等了多久  闲坐着无所事事
just sitting around the last four years, twiddling my thumbs?

803
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,580
或许我们在未来上下的赌注终于能有结果了
Maybe this futures bet we made will finally pay off.

804
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:57,940
我爱她
I'm in love with her.

805
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:11,750
唐娜呢
Where's Donna?

806
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:13,870
她走了
She left.

807
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:25,950
好吧
All right.

808
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:28,810
我们开始吧
Let's do this.

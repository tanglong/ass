我们为浏览器制定了几项初步计划

好吧
Yeah. Okay.

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,350
她想和你说
Wants to talk to you.

Hello?

他和我  我们都同意

我最好

60
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,560
还是待在这里远程

那里现在是几点
What time is it there?

他们比我们快17个小时
They're 17 hours ahead,

so whatever time it is here...

Please!

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,120
你知道那里现在是半夜
You know it's midnight there.

73
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,510
如果这是她指定的时间
This is the time she specified.

All right?

79
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,200
一大清早的
It's too early in the morning for this.

80
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,070
那是因为根本没有人在下载
That is because nobody is downloading it at all.

81
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,400
不  你说得对  原谅我
No, you're right. Forgive me.

82
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,920
上一季度有69人下载了  是不是好一点
69 downloads last quarter. Is that better?

83
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,830
都一年了  我们根本没打开市场
A year and we are barely a ripple in the pond.

84
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,750
当然跟那些漏洞有关
Of course it has to do with the bugs.

85
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,280
我已经在尽快查了
I'm tracking them as fast as I can,

86
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,790
但你总要那么久...
but you take forever to --

87
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,350
好吧
Okay.

88
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,870
好吧  好
Okay, fine.

89
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,860
没问题
That would be fine.

00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,070
-卡梅伦怎么样  -从来没时间
- How's Cameron? - Never available.

91
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,920
就算我们想办法让她接了电话
Or if we do somehow manage to get her on the phone,

92
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,270
她要么很忙  要么很冲  要么
she's busy or defensive or --

93
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,520
只有69个下载
Stuck at 69 downloads.

94
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,390
乔  我们在楼上
Look, Joe, we're building

95
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,490
搭建网络服务提供商核心业务
the core ISP business upstairs by the day,

96
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,720
所以我们不需要浏览器一夜之间大获成功
which means we don't need overnight success with the web browser.

97
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,320
但你为什么老是要这样和她纠缠呢
But why do you keep putting yourself through this with her?

98
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,130
这个项目很重要
This work is important.

99
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,570
我不是问这个
That's not what I asked.

100
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,170

美国在线这么害怕开放网络吗
Is AOL really that afraid of the open Internet?

106
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,580
不然等我们向西扩张就会完全挤垮你们
Well, it's either that or we crush you when we expand west.

107
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,250
那我告诉你  麦克
Well, let me tell you something, Mike --

他是我们的网络服务部
He's our Web Services division.

111
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,800
真厉害  你研究网络
Impressive. You're into the Web.

112
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,080
那是前景所在

戈登
Gordon.

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,440
失陪一下
Excuse us.

115
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,840
名字是马赛克
It's called Mosaic.

116
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,010
好吧  又有浏览器下场抢食了
All right, so there's another browser in the game.

117
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,810
还有奈克萨斯  维奥拉  迈达斯
We still got Nexus, Viola, Midas...

118
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,810
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}均是早期浏览器

119
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,840
别忘了唐娜的杰作  千禧浏览器
Don't forget Millennium, thanks to Donna.

120
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,870
她和我们一样有权开发这个点子
Who's got just as much of a right to this idea as we do.

121
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,810
但是这个不一样
But those aren't this.

122
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,960
内嵌图片  网络论坛支持
Inline images, Web forums support,

123
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,680
全平台通用
available on every platform.

124
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,630
要是卡梅伦没有五个月不见人影
If Cameron hadn't been radio silent for five months,

125
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,820
要是她能及时修复漏洞  帮我们迭代
if she had fixed the bugs, helped us iterate...

126
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,400
输了我不在乎
I don't mind losing,

127
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,490
但我们连竞争的机会都没有
but we're not even gonna get a chance to compete.

128
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,570
卡梅伦哪去了
Where the hell is Cameron?

129
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,060
现在我们做自己的芯片吧
Now we do our own chip.

130
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,710
这边
Over here.

131
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,770
你没事吧
You all right?

132
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,410
没事
Yeah.

133
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,330
我没事
Fine.

134
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,360
她肯定是在做新游戏
I bet it was her new game.

135
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,030
她肯定只是忙得太投入
I'm sure she just got wrapped up in it,

136
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,650
把我们都给忘了
forgot all about us.

137
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,870
如果我们取消应用限制呢
What if we uncapped usage?

138
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,060
让所有用户自由使用
You know, unlimited access for every customer...

139
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,580
取消按小时计费
you know, no more hourly rates,

140
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,870
只设置一个月费
just a, you know, flat monthly fee?

141
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,690
好主意  高明
That's a good idea, smart.

142
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,320
不是我抓住这事不放
Look, I don't mean to harp on it,

143
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,520
但我就是觉得她欠我们一个最终版本
but what galls me is that she still owes us a final version.

144
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,460
我们本有先发优势
We had a first-mover advantage.

145
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,860
结果现在马赛克成了网络的大门
Now Mosaic is the front door to the Web.

146
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,810
是啊  我听说他们头六个月
Yeah, I heard they had a million downloads

147
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,420
就有一百万下载量
in the first six months.

148
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,800
这个数字肯定注水了
Those numbers have to be inflated.

149
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,610
与此同时
Meanwhile,

150
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,050
北极星的下载量高达惊人的431
Loadstar stands at a whopping 431.

151
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,550
也许没什么要紧
Well, maybe that's okay.

152
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,610
但我们明明能大败马赛克
But we can build a Mosaic-killer.

153
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,460
但她就是不肯做
She couldn't do it.

154
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,720
那我们就找个能做的
We'll find someone who can.

155
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,850
乔  你非得每次都是对的吗
Joe, how many times do you have to be right?

156
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,610
也许我们心怀感激就够了
Maybe we should just be grateful or something.

157
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,860
你看这种技术
I mean, this is technology

158
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,680
是我们当初在车库做梦都想不到的
that we could only have dreamed of back in that garage.

159
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,550
你该把奥齐也叫来
You should've brought Ozzie.

160
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,320
我不介意的
I wouldn't have minded.

161
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,310
怎么了
What?

162
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,150
没什么
Nothing.

163
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,360
我们三个星期前分手了
We broke up three weeks ago.

164
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,250
天啊
Oh, man.

165
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,330
戈登
Hey, Gordon...

166
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,030
40岁生日快乐
happy 40th.

167
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,120
干杯
Cheers.

168
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,040
再试试那条走廊
Try the corridor again.

169
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,040
我们刚刚走过了
We were just there,

170
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,950
只找到了根破拐杖似的东西
and all we found was this rusty walking-stick thing.

171
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,090
能装备吗
Can you equip it?

172
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,640
"手杖在你手中化作尘埃"
"The stick particulates in your hand"?

173
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,570
太好了
Cool.

174
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,670
哥们  什么鬼
Dude, what?

175
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,320
感觉像做作业
This feels like homework.

176
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,870
说真的  我看着都快无聊死了
Seriously, I'm getting cold just watching this.

177
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,740
太好了  又一个谜题
Good... another puzzle.

178
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,080
还好我们十多分钟连个人影都没看见
Good thing we haven't seen anybody in like 10 minutes.

179
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,810
甚至都不能打怪
You can't even kill anything.

180
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,520
该死
Shoot.

181
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,800
好吧
Okay.

182
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,470
等等  什么鬼  我们又回到起点了
Wait. What the hell? We're back at the beginning?

183
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,810
这什么破玩意
This is bullshit.

184
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,850
你是谁
Who are you?

185
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,720
你们现在最喜欢的电子游戏是什么
What's your favorite video game right now?

186
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,010
-《真人快打》  -是啊  《真人快打》
- Mortal Kombat. - Yeah, Mortal Kombat.

187
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,340
我更喜欢《街霸2》
I prefer Street Fighter II.

188
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,380
控制更流畅  画面效果更华丽
for the superior controls and graphics.

189
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,920
好吧  多谢你们的参与
Okay. Thank you, guys, for coming in.

190
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,920
这是你们的炸鸡代金券
Here's your Pioneer Chicken gift certificates.

191
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,270
感谢你们的反馈
We appreciate your feedback.

192
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,330
几位  他们不是我们的目标用户
Guys, this is not our target demographic.

193
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,440
我们要争取学习成绩更好的
We need to be going after higher GPAs,

194
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,230
喜欢浸入式魔幻和科幻作品的消费者
readers with immersive fantasy and sci-fi interests.

195
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,610
这个游戏不是拿来玩的  而是拿来体验的
This isn't a game you play. It's a game you live.

196
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,010
多少个网站了
How many websites now?

197
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,250
561个
561.

198
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,930
而且我又给你找到个新的
And I found a new one for you.

199
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,340
如果是那个能把你的名字翻成夏威夷语的
Look, if this is the one that translates your name into Hawaiian,

200
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,950
-我已经试过了  -结果如何
- I already did it. - And?

201
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,370
可乐可呐
Kolekona.

202
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,160
再看看这个
Look at this one.

203
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,170
这是个  咖啡壶
It's a, uh... It's a coffee pot.

204
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,780
这是一个位于剑桥大学的咖啡壶
That is a coffee pot at he University of Cambridge,

205
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,390
在五千英里之外
5,000 miles away.

206
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,540
这不是张图片  这是直播视频
That's not a picture. That's a live video feed.

207
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,360
看上去还真生动啊
Well, it looks really alive.

208
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,950
真是  太厉害了
It's...fascinating.

209
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,090
听着
Listen.

210
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,450
乔  我下来其实是想
Joe, I actually came down here

211
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,120
和你说件事情
to chat with you about something.

212
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,090
说吧
Shoot.

213
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,360
我在想你要不要搬去楼上工作
Well, I was wondering if you'd consider moving upstairs.

214
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,390
为什么
Why?

215
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,540
网络服务部
Well, the Web Services division

216
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,760
没有像预期的那样取得什么进展
hasn't originally grown the way we thought it would,

217
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,980
而且我们需要地方放服务器
and, you know, we could really use the server space.

218
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,640
现在浏览器项目又完蛋了
And... And now that the browser's dead...

219
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,470
完蛋了  我们可能是滞后了一点
Dead? We might have stalled a little bit,

220
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,870
但那是因为我们才刚刚开始
but that's because we're just getting started.

221
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,450
我不上楼
I'm not moving upstairs.

222
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,020
就算要搬  也是你搬下来
If anything, you're moving down here.

223
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,970
乔  你听我说  你在下面待了快三年了
Listen, Joe, you've been down here for almost three years,

224
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,700
还是只有你一个人  一张人体工学椅子
and it's still just you, an ergonomic chair,

225
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,210
还有500张便贴
and 500 Post-its.

226
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,900
你听好  我再说一遍
Listen. I'll say it again.

227
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,370
你做到了  你和莱恩看得很准
You did it. You and Ryan called it.

228
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,580
你说过网络将会成为下一个重要的公共服务
You said the Internet would be the next great public utility.

229
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,690
你猜怎么着  我们已经走到了这一步
Well, guess what? We're here.

230
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,250
我们做到了  我们就像爱迪生
We did it. We are Thomas Edison.

231
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,280
我们创立了网络的电力公司
We built the power company.

232
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,680
所以你为什么不搬到楼上来
So why don't you come upstairs

233
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,770
和我一起经营这个电力公司呢
and run the power company with me?

234
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,070
戈登  没人会记住电力公司的名字
Gordon, nobody remembers the power company.

235
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,060
和我这个月的《大众机械》一起寄来的
Came free in the mail with my Popular Mechanics this month.

236
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,870
美国在线正在地毯式轰炸
AOL is carpet-bombing.

237
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,020
他们准备杀进我们的领域
They're going after our entire territory.

238
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,000
他们正在打击计算机服务和天才两家
They're trying to take down CompuServe and Prodigy,

239
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,940
但是我们很可能会被连带摧毁
but we could get caught in the crossfire.

240
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,750
我只是想说  如果我们要打仗
All I'm saying is, if we're about to go to war,

241
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,660
你能上前线就最好不过了
it'd be nice to have you in the fight.

242
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,500
天啊  都能看视频了
Jesus. It has video now.

243
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:07,940
他妈...
Mother...

244
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,530
不行  亚伯  你今天上午就得全面执行升级
No, Abe, you needed to fully implement the updates this morning!

245
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,880
你试试抱着个
You try reformatting HTML

246
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,290
又哭又闹的6个月孩子修改网页
with a screaming 6-month-old in your arm.

247
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,460
真是会赶巧啊你
Oh, that's just great timing, isn't it?

248
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,140
-是啊  -那好
- Oh, yeah, it is. - Yeah. Okay, good.

249
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,950
她马上就到
She'll be right with you.

250
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,980
谢谢
Thank you.

251
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,040
胡萝卜  西柚  外加一点姜
Carrot, grapefruit, little bit of ginger.

252
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,550
微软的主页宣布没有得到
Microsoft didn't get the bump they wanted

253
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,790
预期的效应
from the Home announcement.

254
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,990
我知道  才0.5%
I know. Two hundredths of a point.

255
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,050
但Windows还是白宫的官方系统
Well, Windows is still the official O.S. of the White House.

256
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,930
早上好
Good morning.

257
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,710
首先  非常感谢你今早让我们来
First off, thanks for calling us in this morning.

258
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,420
相信我  要是你没有联系我们
Believe me, if you hadn't had reached out,

259
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,320
我们也...
we would've --

260
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,010
我们肯定也会想办法来见你
You know, we would've been bothering you to get in here

261
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,280
因为我们很兴奋
because we are just so darn excited

262
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,040
我们打算采取一些能超越马赛克的措施
about some of these steps we're taking to surpass Mosaic.

263
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,790
等我们执行完毕
By the time we are done fully implementing,

264
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,740
马赛克就什么都不是了
it'll be like, "Mosaic? What's Mosaic?"

265
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,230
所以  来跟你汇报一下进度
So, just to catch you up,

266
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,760
千禧现在支持...
Millennium now supports...

267
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,540
好的
Right.

268
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,490
内嵌图像了
inline images.

269
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,960
下面还添加了停止按钮
Yeah, we got a stop button right there

270
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,560
停止网页加载  看
to halt web-page loads. See?

271
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:47,410
很快我们的推荐列表就要上线了
And, uh, we should have our very own "Hotlists" soon.

272
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,660
视频呢
Video?

273
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,560
是的  当然
Yes. Yes, of course.

274
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,950
我们正在努力  用不了几天了
We are hard at work on that. Matter of days.

275
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,820
我们还提前展开了品牌推广
We've also been proactive with our branding efforts --

276
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,660
把我们的名声传出去
you know, getting our name out there.

277
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,470
格雷格  鼠标垫  谢谢
Greg, the mouse pads, please.

278
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,630
格雷格  鼠标垫  谢谢
Greg, the mouse pads, please.

279
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,630
为了广而告之
You know, to spread the word,

280
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,460
我们的下载量  虽然还没赶上马赛克
and, um, our download numbers, while not Mosaic's,

281
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,880
但是已经开始挤掉北极星了  所以...
are really starting to edge out Loadstar, so...

282
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,460
但我们不能只想着追赶马赛克  对吗
But we don't want to be just chasing Mosaic, do we?

283
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,650
你们的天分远不止于此
You guys are too talented for that.

284
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,280
你们要追求自己的想法
You need to be pursuing your own vision,

285
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,970
不能总模仿别人  对吧
not aping somebody else's, right?

286
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,000
再同意不过了  没错
We couldn't agree more. Yes.

287
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,410
很好
Wonderful.

288
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,270
那就这样了
Then we are all set.

289
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,150
我之前真的很支持你们的
I was really rooting for you guys.

290
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,590
谢谢  唐娜  我们很感激
Thanks, Donna. We really appreciate it.

291
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,240
我们是不是失去了资助
Did we just get defunded?

292
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,540
-别碰我  -是你问我的
- Get your hands off me. - You asked.

293
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,340
我说了别碰我  亚伯
I said don't touch me, Abe!

294
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,960
真是
Jesus!

295
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,330
好
All right!

296
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,040
好吧
All right.

297
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,140
瞧瞧谁来了
Look who it is.

298
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,500
公司的邀请名单上有我
I was on the company invite list.

299
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,960
所以你还是能收到邮件的
So you do get e-mails.

300
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,100
-看到马赛克了吗  -看到马赛克了
- Have you seen Mosaic? - I saw Mosaic.

301
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,270
都五个月没你的音讯了
I haven't heard from you in five months.

302
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,430
你就这么突然出现了
Now you're just here.

303
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,850
说实话  我都不知道你回国了
Honestly, I didn't even know you were in the country.

304
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,910
我很抱歉  我应该...
Yeah, I'm sorry. I should've --

305
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,900
我以为能有时间和你谈谈的
You know, I-I thought I was gonna find time to talk to you.

306
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,180
我没想到派对会这么...
I didn't know the party was gonna be so --

307
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,560
听着  没事的
Look, look, look. Don't worry about it.

308
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,950
说实话  我都没那么生气
To be honest with you, I'm not even that mad.

309
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,390
不过乔会杀了你的
Joe's gonna kill you.

310
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,270
他在吗
Is he here?

311
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,190
乔·麦克米伦会来派对
Joe MacMillan at a party?

312
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,130
你真是离开太久了
You've been out of the loop for a while.

313
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,430
来抱抱
Well, come on!

314
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,070
你怎么来这里了
Hey, what the heck are you doing here?

315
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,500
天哪  看看
My God! Look!

316
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,990
我是在  推广我的新游戏
I'm -- I'm doing some, um, promotion for my new game.

317
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,920
那个《朝圣者》啊  我看到了
Yeah, The Pilgrim, sure. I've seen it.

318
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,290
看上去挺吓人
Ooh, looks spooky.

319
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,910
对了  约翰非常喜欢那个航海罗盘
By the way, John absolutely loved that sailing compass.

320
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,060
是啊  我把它安在防水墙上了
Sure. I got it mounted right on the bulkhead.

321
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,310
我们得抽点时间过去
You know, we got to get over there

322
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,330
见见他们  越快越好
and see these guys some time. Soon?

323
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,450
只等黛安想到要怎么能报销
Once Diane figures out how to make it business write-off.

324
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,040
约翰  谢谢了
Gee, John, thanks.

325
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,860
我开玩笑的
I'm kidding.

326
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,560
你们什么时候来都欢迎
Oh, I mean, you guys are welcome whenever you want.

327
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,740
我刚看到琼妮  去打个招呼
I just saw Joanie, so I'm gonna go say hi.

328
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,310
好的  很高兴见到你
Okay. Good to see you.

329
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,220
你什么时候带我去那艘船上
When are you gonna take me out on that boat?

330
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,690
我们很快就去  船长

331
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,080

332
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,860

333

334
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,080
好
Okay.

335
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,750
从这场面来看
By the looks of all this,

336
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,330
卡奈特一年得挣了五六千万吧
CalNect pulls down, what, 50, 60 mil a year?

337
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,070
我觉得是六千
I'll say it's 60.

338
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,410
进入亚利桑那后得有七千五了
Well, hell, 75 now that they're down in Arizona.

Still, 25 ISP competitors in the landscape and growing,

340
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,690

346
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,740
约翰  我只是说  美国在线要进来的话
John, all I'm saying is that with AOL coming to town,

347
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,490
你不觉得这一切看上去有点过于乐观了吗

432
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,700
好吧  这很有可能会害我吐出来
Okay, there's a decent chance this is gonna make me barf.

433
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,180
你今早和琼妮的情况一样
You and Joanie are in the same boat this morning.

434
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,770
你可以扔香蕉皮吗
You can throw banana peels?

435
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,220
你怎么这么会玩这个
How'd you get so good at this?

436
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,890
我大概一年半前
I got my hands on a prototype cartridge

437
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,490
就拿到卡带原型机了
about a year and a half ago.

438
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,100
你还真把西南部传统带到这儿来了
Man, you really brought the Southwest in here,

439
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,840
不是吗  戈登
didn't you, Gordon?

440
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,910
少来
Easy.

441
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,180
你还要在城里待多久
How much longer are you in town for?

442
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,010
不知道
I don't know.

443
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,620
但如果你想看到最疯狂的场面
But if you want to see the craziest thing,

444
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:53,530
就该去看看为我新游戏做测试的焦点小组
you should swing by the focus-group testing for my new game.

445
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,350
就跟《灵魂大搜索》里一样
It's like "Altered States"

446
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,550
但不是服了迷药而是在做市场调研
but with market research instead of LSD.

447
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,770
那这游戏最好很好玩
That damn game better be good.

448
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,800
不是吧  我刚得了一个红贝壳
Of course, right when I get a red shell.

449
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,130
给你
Here.

450
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,880
你看看好不好玩
You tell me if it's good.

451
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,120
《朝圣者》
"Pilgrim."

452
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,840
我很高兴你能这么成功  戈登
I'm glad you're doing so well, Gordon.

453
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,680
谢谢
Thanks.

454
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,630
是啊
Yeah.

455
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,990
我干得真的真的很好
I'm doing really, really great.

456
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:31,460
昨晚  我都成了人体画笔了
I mean, last night, I got to be a human paintbrush.

457
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,230
我看见了
I saw that.

458
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:35,030
卡奈特很有竞争力
You know, CalNect is... it's kicking ass.

459
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,230
我很遗憾只有北极星没成
Well, I'm sorry that Loadstar has to be the exception.

460
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,390
-我  -得了
- I... - Come on.

461
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,520
我说实话
You know, if I'm being totally honest,

462
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,960
随着时间推移  浏览器对于我
as time wore on, the browser just became

463
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,560
更多是个附带项目
more of a side project for me.

464
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,480
它一直是乔的宝贝
It's always been Joe's baby.

465
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,160
乔
Joe.

466
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,170
我昨晚见到他了
I saw him last night.

467
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,300
然后呢
And?

468
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,950
戈登  不是很愉快
Oh, Gordon, it didn't go that well.

469
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,610
那样或许也好
Well, that's probably for the best.

470
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:01,930
对于谁
For who?

471
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,230
对于他
For him.

472
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,960
该死
Oh, shit!

473
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,040
怎么了
What?

474
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,530
孩子们还没走呢
The girls haven't left yet.

475
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,610
海莉  琼妮  来啊  走了
Haley, Joanie! Come on! Let's go!

476
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,070
戈登
Gordon?

477
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,300
不  她从不进来的  别担心
No, she never comes in. Don't worry.

478
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,130
好吧  那周三见了
All right, well, um, I'll see you Wednesday.

479
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,430
我也爱你
Love you, too.

480
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,920
琼妮  快走
Joanie, let's go!

481
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,310
戈登
Gordon?

482
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,820
你看到马赛克了吗
Uh, have you seen Mosaic?

483
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,290
看到了
Yes.

484
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,800
我很意外居然不是你的
I was surprised it wasn't you.

485
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,320
她可能...
She may have gotten into the...

486
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,030
爸爸
Dad.

487
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,290
快走
Get out here.

488
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,800
多谢
Thanks for this.

489
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,940
嗯
Yeah.

490
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,430
不客气
Anytime.

491
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,070
她很少进来的
She rarely comes in.

492
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,200
不出所料  固定费率和检修消耗
As expected, the flat fee and unkept usage

493
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,150
起初拉低了总体收入
dinged the overall revenue initially,

494
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,420
但现在我们交易大了
but now we're in the volume business.

495
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,660
用户群在不断扩大
The user base just keeps going up.

496
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,100
那这就不是回弹  是可持续增长
Then this isn't a rebound. It's sustained growth.

497
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,830
那很好
That's good.

498
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,450
问题是  带宽不够用了
Only problem is the pipe's getting tight.

499
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,720
数据量那么大  我们开始出现堵塞了
We're starting to clog a little bit with all that data.

500
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,030
世通[电信企业]听说我们业绩多好
MCI hears how well we're doing,

501
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,910
会想重新就私下交易谈判
they're gonna want to renegotiate the sweetheart deal

502
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,930
然后给我们更多他们双绞线网络的带宽
before they give us more bandwidth on their twisted pair network.

503
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,050
我们可以表现出犹豫  去跟太平洋贝尔联络
We could balk and try PacBell,

504
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:44,910
但说到底
but at the end of the day,

505
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,120
我们得让我们的主干网供应商高兴  不管是谁
we'd want to keep our backbone provider happy, whoever they are.

506
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,510
你觉得呢  戈登
What do you think, Gordon?

507
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,730
如果世通想抬价  那可以
If MCI wants more money, fine.

508
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,610
我们有钱  给他们好了
We've got it. Let's give it to them.

509
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,290
不是只有美国在线财力雄厚
AOL's not the only one with deep pockets.

510
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,680
我们要保持优势
Let's stay ahead of this.

511
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,290
谢普  去打电话
Shep, get a call in.

512
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:06,170
乔  谢谢你今天来
And, uh, Joe, thanks for sitting in today.

513
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,120
这是什么
What is this?

514
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,730
北极星
Loadstar.

515
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,000
是完成的浏览器吗
Is that the finished browser?

516
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,970
你就一直拖着
You've just been sitting on this?

517
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,480
没时间早点交过来吗
Couldn't get around to handing it in?

518
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,470
不是  我昨晚完成的
No. I finished it last night.

519
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,930
怎么  一天就做好了
So, it was, what, a day of work?

520
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,590
乔  我研究这个好几周了
Joe, I've been working on this for weeks.

521
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,610
你并不需要干坐着等我的
You know, you didn't have to sit around and wait for me.

522
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,400
你要是那么急
If you were in such a rush,

523
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,170
你另雇个人写代码就好了
you could have hired somebody else to do the coding.

524
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,090
你不懂  我需要你的
You don't get it. I needed you.

525
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,080
我们需要你在乎  可你不在乎
We needed you to care, and you didn't.

526
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,280
我们原本比马赛克的人早开始近一年
We had almost a year on the Mosaic guys,

527
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,810
但我们错过了机会  现在
but we blew it, and now...

528
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,080
要是你在  真在这儿工作
If you had just been here, actually been available...

529
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,560
我不能来这儿  情况就是这样
Well, I couldn't be here. That was the deal.

530
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,130
那对我很不公平
And it was a raw deal for me.

531
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,630
而且太遗憾了
And it's just a shame.

532
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,030
很遗憾五千英里还是不够远
It's a shame that 5,000 miles away wasn't far enough.

533
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,430
你究竟在气什么
What is this about?

534
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,290
我已经把这个做得比需要的好很多了
Look, I made this better than it had any right to be,

535
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:20,040
而且我同时还得处理好多我自己的事
and I did so while dealing with a lot of my own stuff.

536
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,750
是啊  你的游戏
Oh, right, your game.

537
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,750
我相信你肯定很不容易
I'm sure that was tough,

538
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,560
有资金  受提拔  受宠爱
being funded, promoted, coddled.

539
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,640
我一直一个人
I've been alone on this,

540
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,400
在这上研究了三年
working by myself for three years.

541
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,740
你想谈谈我们真正在谈的事吗
Do you want to talk about what we're really talking about?

542
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,500
如果我们做这个了
If we had worked on this...

543
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,900
一起做
together...

544
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,070
本可以非常了不起的
it could have been amazing.

545
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,110
你想要我做什么
What do you want me to do?

546
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,080
什么都不用
Nothing.

547
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,830
太迟了
It's too late.

548
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,410
而且  我得继续工作了  那就...
And I, um, got to get back to work, so...

549
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,180
看现在的情况
You know, the way things are growing...

550
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,700
你很快就要没便贴可用了
you're gonna run out of Post-its pretty soon.

551
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,470
告诉俄勒冈州  他们市场不够大
Well, tell Oregon they're not a big enough market

552
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,770
不吸引数字用户投资
for Digital Subscriber investments.

553
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,150
我们开始吧
Let's get started.

554
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:09,210
首先  容我说
Well, first off, let me just say,

555
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,640
仅代表流浪者智囊团
on behalf of the Rover brain trust,

556
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,870
很高兴再次见到你
it's great to see you again.

557
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,190
我们已结束了测试阶段
We're moving past the beta phase.

558
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,060
我们已在三个医学院起步
We are already underway in three med schools,

559
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,870
还有两家也提出了请求
with requests for two more.

560
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,680
但不那么可喜的是
A little more sobering, though,

561
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,450
我们比预期稍快了一点
is that we've gone through our seed round

562
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:28,040
耗尽了我们的种子基金  现在
just a hair faster than expected, and now...

563
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,790
现在你们需要更多钱
Now you need more money.

564
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:30,830
是的
Well, yes.

565
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,650
要么就得裁员
It's either that or we let some people go...

566
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,000
主要是实习生
interns, mostly.

567
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,280
但这仍是企业软件
But this is still enterprise software,

568
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,480
企业对企业  目前只针对医疗记录
B2B currently focused only on medical records.

569
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,060
是的  用二进制查询进入数据库
Yes, through binary queries into the data pool,

570
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,800
但我们在进行改善  以期实现更多同类应用
but we're refining comparisons to make things more versatile.

571
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,920
好吧  我直说了
Okay, I'll just cut to the chase here.

572
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,700
我给你们的资金够你们做医疗数据库项目了
I've given you enough funding for a medical database program.

573
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,680
如果你们想要更多资金  我需要更大的点子
If you want more funding, I will need a bigger idea.

574
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,330
24小时后我们再谈吧
Let's talk again in 24 hours.

575
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:00,500
这也太快了吧
Uh, that's a mighty quick turnaround.

576
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,620
是啊
Yes. Yes, it is.

577
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,520
戈登
Gordon.

578
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,110
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

579
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,640
怎么了
What's up?

580
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,420
我有想法
I've got something.

581
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,060
我们还可以做那扇门
We can still be the door.

582
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,690
或许不是个浏览器  事实上  不该是
Maybe it's not a browser. In fact, it shouldn't be.

583
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,710
我们要建个网站  任何浏览器都可以登录
We're gonna build a website that is accessible from any browser.

584
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,790
就像一个网站的网站
Like a... Like a website of websites,

585
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:34,070
一个收录一切的索引  名录
an index of everything, like a directory.

586
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,300
怎么  像黄页吗
What, like the Yellow Pages?

587
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,460
对  但不止如此
Yes, but more than that.

588
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,310
我还没想透彻  但是
I don't have the full thing yet, but...

589
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,220
乔
Look, Joe.

590
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,730
乔  你先打住吧
Joe, let me stop you right there.

591
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,020
我以为你回来做正事了
I thought you were back on the business,

592
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,930
我们的正事  这个生意
our business, this business.

593
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,950
你什么时候才能醒过来啊
When are you gonna wake up?

594
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,860
-什么  -你在梦游
- What? - You're sleepwalking.

595
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,940
那个派对算什么  戈登
I mean, what the hell was that party, Gordon?

596
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,700
我想庆祝我们的成功
I wanted to celebrate our success.

597
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,690
你是想说服自己
You're trying to convince yourself

598
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,740
你可以停下  虽然你的一切直觉
that it's okay to stop when every fiber of your being

599
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,960
都在让你继续
is telling yourself to keep going.

600
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,340
我这么多年一直跟你说  你是个建造者
I've been telling you for years that you are a builder.

601
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,750
你得建造
You need to build.

602
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,850
知道吗  乔  我建造了这个
You know what, Joe? I built this.

603
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,380
我建造了这一切  而你在楼下的地下室里
I built all of this when you were downstairs in the basement

604
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,080
玩便贴
screwing around with Post-it notes.

605
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,400
是卡梅伦让你说这些的吗
Did Cameron put you up to this?

606
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,050
我看到她今天来过了
I noticed that she stopped by today.

607
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,390
当然是她
Of course she did.

608
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:33,650
听着  我们只是希望你
Look, all we're asking is that you

609
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,930
把游戏操作写入手册
put the game's controls in the manual.

610
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,290
-不行  -就是这样
- No. - That's it.

611
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,520
不  对于魔术  最糟的
No, the worst thing you can do with a magic trick

612
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,040
就是解释其原理
is explain how it works.

613
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,080
不管观众如何要求
No matter how much the audience asks,

614
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,340
让他们自己去发现
it's so much more rewarding

615
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,610
效果会好得多
if they get to discover it for themselves.

616
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,670
你得尊重玩家
You have to respect the player.

617
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,190
怎么样
So?

618
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,700
是个精彩的旅程吧
It's a trip, huh?

619
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,070
卡梅伦  你来这儿干什么
Cameron, what are you doing here?

620
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,600
我说了  我得推广游戏
I told you. I have to promote the game.

621
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,520
不  我是问你究竟来干吗
No, I mean, what are you doing here?

622
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,720
这些破事本来都放下了
This shit was all behind us.

623
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,000
浏览器吗
The browser?

624
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,120
乔
Joe.

625
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,980
你根本不知道  他花了多大力气
You have no idea how hard he's worked

626
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,560
才回到他现在的状态  我又付出了多少
to get back to where he is... how hard I've worked.

627
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,380
现在  突然
And now, all of a sudden, you know,

628
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,440
你对没拿出北极星感到歉疚
you feel guilty about no-showing on Loadstar.

629
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,550
你回到了他的生活中  让他又开始发狂了
You come back into his life and you got him spinning.

630
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,810
-我什么都没做  -你跟他在地下室
- I didn't do anything. - Look, you spent five minutes with him

631
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,260
谈了五分钟  现在他就坚信
in the basement, and now he's convinced

632
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,360
你从山顶取了圣火给他
that you've handed him fire from the mountaintop.

633
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,540
我不是说你是有意的
Look, I'm not saying that you're doing this on purpose,

634
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,010
但每次你回到他的生活中
but every single time that you come back into his life...

635
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,070
那东西是我欠他的
I owed him that work.

636
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,150
欠你们俩的
I owed both of you.

637
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,860
昨天  你问我  你是不是残忍
You know, yesterday you asked me if you were cruel.

638
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,310
抱歉  这个房间我们只能用到10点
Sorry. We only have the room until 10:00.

639
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,360
见到你很高兴  戈登
It was great to see you, Gordon.

640
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:27,600
是啊  上帝为何要创造宿醉
Yeah. I mean, isn't that why God created hangovers...

641
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,720
不就是为了教青少年别喝那么多吗
teach teenagers not to drink so much?

642
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,220
不单是喝酒的事
Drinking is one thing.

643
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,730
至少在家里喝  有家长看着
Okay, well, it's better off at home with one of us

644
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,240
总好过在外面喝  是吧
than somewhere else, right?

645
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,120
戈登  没事的
Gordon, it's fine.

646
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,670
她跟你说她不去大学了吗
She told you she's not going to college yet,

647
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,100
还是这话依然只是用来折磨我的
or is she still just torturing me with that one?

648
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,250
我们的女儿思想这么自由也是好事
It's a positive that our daughter has such a free spirit.

649
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,990
琼妮绝对是够机灵
Well, Joanie is certainly resourceful.

650
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,720
你不会相信她都用了多少家居用品
You wouldn't believe the variety of household items...

651
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,670
甚至用水果
fruit, even...

652
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,100
来抽大麻
she's found a way to smoke pot out of.

653
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,090
这就是个卖点了
Well, there's your selling point right there.

654
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,900
她会喜欢伯克利的
She'd love Berkeley.

655
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,630
我会跟她谈的
I'll talk to her.

656
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:02,830
谢谢
Thank you.

657
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,050
前两天看到卡梅伦感觉好怪
It was weird to see Cameron the other day,

658
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,470
还穿着你的运动裤
especially in your sweatpants.

659
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,430
你知道的
Oh, well, you know,

660
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,670
她一直超级喜欢我的
she's always had a major, major thing for me.

661
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,030
才不会
No.

662
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,080
我喜欢你觉得
Yeah, well, I liked that you thought

663
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,520
还有这种可能性
it was even a possibility.

664
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,700
你知道关于马赛克她对我说了什么吗
You know what she said to me about Mosaic?

665
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,130
她说  "我很意外居然不是你的"
She said, "I was surprised it wasn't you."

666
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,690
那是什么意思
What is that supposed to mean?

667
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,780
我不知道
I don't know.

668
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,970
她最近的来访让乔对一个新点子
Her latest visit's got Joe jumping up and down

669
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,130
-激动得上蹿下跳  -当然了
- about some new idea. - Of course.

670
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,490
他突然觉得
Yeah, I mean, he suddenly thinks

671
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:38,590
他该为所有现存的网站做个索引
he should index every website in existence.

672
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,970
那要怎么做到啊
How would you even do that?

673
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:44,150
相信我  他这三年来一直在一丝不苟地
Trust me, he's been meticulously building a list of URLs...

674
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:46,350
徒手建立一个网址清单
by hand... for the last three years.

675
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,420
听上去好乏味啊
That sounds awfully tedious.

676
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,910
是啊
Yeah, well, you know.

677
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,180
乔嘛  咬住不放的人
Joe... dog with a bone.

678
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,700
是啊
That he is.

679
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,000
而卡梅伦喜欢喷彩虹出来
And Cameron loves to shit out rainbows

680
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,390
好让人不去在意她的混蛋行为
to distract from her asshole behavior.

681
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,150
我想要鲑鱼  你呢
I'm gonna do the salmon. You?

682
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,170
不错  我也要一样的吧
Sounds good. I'll do the same.

683
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,390
敬马赛克
Here's to Mosaic...

684
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:13,640
以及我们各自对手浏览器的死亡
and the respective death of our competing browsers.

685
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,020
好消息  我们做到了
Good news. We nailed it.

686
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,720
杂志
Magazines.

687
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,090
我们用算法做大型出版物
We use the algorithm to index back catalogs

688
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,700
历史目录的索引  一本本地做
of major publications one magazine at a time.

689
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,240
好了  这些文本文件
Voilà... a trove of text documents

690
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,450
有一个非结构化数据问题
with an unstructured data problem

691
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,510
正等着人来解决
just waiting to be solved.

692
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,380
不  那个不行
No, that's not it.

693
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,250
我们还讨论了法律服务
We also discussed legal service...

694
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:45,230
案件和先例的历史档案
backlogs of briefs and precedents.

695
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:48,230
-我们...  -这些都是积压数据
- Well, we... - Look, this is all dead data.

696
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,600
什么在增长
What's growing?

697
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:55,110
我们能把算法用在什么有活力的东西上
What can we apply the algorithm to that's dynamic?

698
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,380
我们做的是未来的生意
We're in the future business here.

699
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,340
我不知道要怎么为实时数据做索引
I don't know how we index live data.

700
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,770
那太不幸了
Ah, well, then that's unfortunate.

701
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,950
网络呢
Uh, well, what about the Web?

702
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,210
光是这一年  网站数量就增长了500%
The... The number of websites has grown 500% this year alone.

703
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,530
到了明年  就可能呈指数增长
By next year, it could grow exponentially.

704
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:14,540
到时  数据库从理论上讲是无限的
At that point, the data pool's theoretically limitless.

705
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,800
我们得调整算法
We'd have to adjust the algorithm,

706
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,430
但我们可以尝试为整个网络做索引
but we could endeavor to index the entire Web,

707
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:21,090
好供人搜索
make it searchable.

708
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,260
要怎么做索引呢
And how would you index it?

709
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,540
用算法
W-With the algorithm.

710
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,420
要完全自动化  计算机化
It'd be fully automated and computerized.

711
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,380
那么就要几乎能做到即时更新
That means it'd be up to date almost instantly

712
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,960
每一个新增的网站
with every new site addition.

713
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:47,940
就是这个
That's it.

714
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,910
就是这个点子
That's the idea.

715
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,690
别告诉我破解恩索谜题的奖励
Don't tell me the reward for solving Enso puzzle

716
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:12,630
就是被传送回游戏开始
was getting transported back to the beginning of the game.

717
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,010
我恐怕有坏消息要告诉你
I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you.

718
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,350
那么恩索是个零  我得重新开始
So the Enso is a zero, and I've got to start over.

719
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:28,180
或许  它是一切
Or maybe it means everything.

720
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,150
现在你可以以全新的方式
Now you can approach the path you've taken

721
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,860
走上你走过的道路了
in an entirely new way.

722
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,130
那天的事我很抱歉
I'm sorry about the other day.

723
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,970
我就是不愿相信
I was just having trouble believing that

724
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:46,890
浏览器已经结束了
the browser was done,

725
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:50,790
我知道  那个
and I know that that is...

726
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,600
已经结束了
over now.

727
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,010
真的
I do.

728
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,990
不管怎样  我不希望要
Regardless, I don't want five months

729
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,960
过五个月或五年才能再跟你联系
or five years to go by before I hear from you.

730
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,680
别再消失了
So don't disappear again.

731
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:10,070
我希望你能  常在我生活中
I want to... know you in my life.

732
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,270
你已经很了解我了  乔
You already know me, Joe.

733
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,430
我不回日本了
I'm not going back to Japan.

734
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,740
汤姆离开了我
Tom left me.

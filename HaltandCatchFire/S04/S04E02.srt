怎么回事
What happened?

37
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,140
他...
He...

38
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,160
认识了别人
met someone else.

39
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,520
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

40
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,390
你...
Are -- are you...

41
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,500
离婚了吗
Divorced?

42
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,190
我是想问没事吧  但是...
I was gonna say "Okay," But...

43
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,170
没事
Yes.

44
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,670
应该没事
Yeah, I-I guess I am.

45
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,490
那  你离婚了吗
So, are you divorced?

46
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,730
快了
Almost.

47
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,070
在日本处理这些事真的很麻烦
You know, it's a pain in the ass doing it from Japan.

48
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,310
得填各种表格  去好几趟邮局
So there's all these forms and trips to the post office

49
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,590
往德州寄材料
and sending stuff to Texas.

50
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:59,130
感觉一切都像一个奇怪的梦
And it all feels like this weird dream...

51
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,850
结婚  去东京...
...being married and Tokyo...

52
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,670
对不起
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,080
你想听我说吗
Do you want to hear this?

54
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,640
你说什么我都愿意听
I want to hear whatever you want to tell me.

55
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,610
我感觉自己像个傻子
I feel like an idiot.

56
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,890
你不是傻子
You're not an idiot.

57
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,670
也许有些冲动
Impulsive, maybe.

58
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,190
好吧  乔
Okay, Joe.

59
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,290
我也很冲动  所以...
I'm impulsive, too, so...

60
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,340
你...准备留在加州吗
Are you, uh -- are you gonna stay in California?

61
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,050
我不知道
I don't know.

62
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,710
但是我该离开这个宾馆
I should get out of this hotel, though.

63
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,190
这里的淋浴太差了  我想好好泡个澡
The shower sucks, and I really want a bath.

64
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,650
我在日本经常泡澡
I took a lot of baths in Japan.

65
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,120
我喜欢泡澡
I love a good bath.

66
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
是啊
Yeah.

67
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,230
不给点游戏的提示吗
So, no hints about this game, huh?

68
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,790
不给  你得自己想明白
No. You got to figure it out yourself.

69
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,470
但是太难了
But it's so hard.

70
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,160
等你想出来
It is until you figure it out.

71
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,960
就不难了
And then it isn't.

72
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,930
是谁
Who was it?

73
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,970
什么是谁
Who was what?

74
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,710
跟汤姆...的那女人
The woman that Tom...

75
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,420
这个...
That's, uh...

76
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,820
这是最有趣的部分  我都没问
That's the best part. I never even asked.

77
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,580
跟我说话  跟我说点什么
Talk to me. Tell me something.

78
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,700
跟你说什么
Tell you what?

79
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,240
就...我不知道  随便  人间生活
Just -- I don't know -- anything, life on Earth.

80
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,250
我都错过了什么
What'd I miss?

81
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,350
你想听什么
Well, what do you want to hear?

82
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,650
-乔  跟我说说话  -好吧
- Joe, just talk to me. - Okay.

83
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,810
你知道比尔·克林顿是现在的总统吗
Did you know that Bill Clinton is the president?

84
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,350
知道  日本人很喜欢他
Yeah. They love him in Japan.

85
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,070
那些芝士汉堡
All those cheeseburgers.

86
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,740
还有什么
So, what else?

87
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,260
牛仔队赢了超级碗杯
The Cowboys won the Super Bowl.

88
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,170
奥黛丽·赫本死了  瑞弗·菲尼克斯也死了
Audrey Hepburn died. And so did River Phoenix.

89
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,300
有几个疯子想炸掉世贸中心  还有...
some crazies tried to blow up the World Trade Center, and,

90
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,200
你可以在军队里做同性恋
you can be gay in the military,

91
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,770
但是别人不能问你
but nobody can ask you about it,

92
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,350
你也不能告诉别人
and you can't tell anybody.

93
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,160
你知道IBM损失了50亿吗
Did you know IBM lost $5 billion?

94
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,680
他们查过沙发垫下面吗
They check the couch cushions?

95
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,710
戈登经历了一个养生阶段
You know, Gordon went through this whole health phase.

96
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,600
他家里有个房间全是健身器材
He's got a room in his house full of gym stuff.

97
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,090
他买了一个诺迪克跑步机
Like, he's got this NordicTrack

98
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,720
还有什么屁股塑形大师
and something called a ButtMaster, so...

99
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,320
然后  我也遇到了一件事
And, um, this thing happened to me.

100
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,350
我去西夫韦超市时  下车后
I was getting out of my car at a Safeway,

101
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,440
看到一个女人在挥舞着手臂
and I saw this woman flailing her arms, just --

102
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,610
一群蜜蜂在袭击她
A swarm of bees was attacking her,

103
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,080
不停地叮她
just stinging her again and again, you know?

104
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,580
她摔倒在地
And she fell to the ground.

105
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,430
然后一辆冰激凌车
And out of nowhere,

106
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,710
不知道从哪里钻出来冲过停车场
this ice-cream truck comes screaming through the parking lot,

107
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,610
还放着《骗中骗》[叮咬]的音乐
and it's playing that music from The Sting.

108
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,040
那个人从车上跑下来
And the guy gets out of the -- the truck,

109
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,980
开始对她做心肺复苏什么的
and he's doing CPR and everything.

110
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:17,990
那辆车还在放叮叮咚咚的钢琴曲
And the truck is still playing that tinkling piano music,

111
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,930
救护车到了后  还在继续放
and it keeps playing it even after the ambulance arrives.

112
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,170
我那几天满脑子都是那件事
And it's all I could think about for days,

113
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:29,080
那些医护人员
these paramedics

114
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,860
就着这背景音乐  疯狂地抢救她
just working on her like crazy while this music played

115
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,290
那可能是她最后听到的东西
and how that might be the last thing she ever hears.

116
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,570
卡梅伦
Cameron?

117
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,340
卡梅
Cam?

118
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,080
我就继续说吧
I'll just keep talking

119
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,260
因为我觉得
'cause I think you're --

120
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,040
我觉得你还在听
I think you're still there.

121
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,370
你在听吗
Are you there?

122
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,660
我在呢
I'm here.

123
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,120
喂
Hello?

124
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,400
喂
Hello?

125
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,600
喂
Hello?

126
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,620
我刚刚在泡茶
I was just making some tea.

127
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,120
你想知道你的名字在夏威夷叫什么吗
Do you want to know what your Hawaiian name is?

128
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,280
说说
Okay.

129
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,520
是卡梅拉诺
It's Kamelonu.

130
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,110
有一个网站可以...
See, there's this whole website where you --

131
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,500
你一直没挂吗
You didn't hang up?

132
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,980
是啊  我得告诉你我的名字在夏威夷叫什么
Well, yeah, I had to tell you my Hawaiian name.

133
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,780
是什么
What is it?

134
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,320
就是乔  只不过第一个字母是I
It's just Joe, but with an I instead of a J.

135
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,340
"姚"吗
Eye-oh-ee?

136
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,190
其实我觉得应该读"哟"
I actually think that's it's "Yo."

137
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,120
对吧
Right?

138
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,210
好吧  我不会叫你哟的
Right. I'm not calling you "Yo."

139
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,660
这真像是卡梅拉诺会说的话
That is such a Kamelonu thing to say.

140
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,690
圣何塞真奇怪
San Jose is so weird.

141
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,780
你知道那里其实比旧金山要大吗
You know it's actually bigger than San Francisco?

142
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,660
我知道  但是看上去小多了  对吧
I know, but it seems so much smaller, doesn't it?

143
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,250
我觉得我看到了一个水上公园
I think I see a water park.

144
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,190
我12岁后就再没玩过水滑梯
I haven't ridden a water slide since I was twelve.

145
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,320
那是不是很奇怪
Isn't that weird?

146
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,040
你可能已经玩了你人生中最后一次水滑梯
You might have already been on your last water slide.

147
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,850
不可能  我一直想买下一个水上公园
No way. I always planned on buying up a water park,

148
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,610
一个人住在那里  到晚上就去滑水道
living there alone, riding the flumes by night.

149
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,680
是吗
Yeah?

150
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,770
这就是你长大后想做的事吗
That's what you wanted to do when you grew up?

151
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,980
老实说  我觉得我一直是个大人
Honestly, I feel like I've always been a grown up.

152
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,860
我猜你是唯一一个下巴棱角分明的
Well, I bet you were one of the only babies

153
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,340
小婴儿
with a chiseled jawline.

154
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,940
不  其实还有一个
No, there was one other kid,

155
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,180
但是我们打了个你死我活
but we fought to the death.

156
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,700
你对流浪者怎么看
What do you think about Rover?

157
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,260
流浪者
Rover?

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,630
他们很聪明
They're...smart,

159
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,960
要价低
pivot on a dime,

160
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,320
团队协作很好
good team dynamics.

161
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,260
是啊  但你不觉得艾略特和维拉
Yeah, but doesn't it seem like Elliot and Vera

162
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,000
有时候想杀了对方吗
just want to kill each other sometimes?

163
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,820
那是因为他们是夫妻
That's because they're married.

164
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,710
那怪不得了
Yeah, that makes sense.

165
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,950
你该知道
You should just know that

166
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,700
他们每晚开车回家的时候
they're gonna talk major shit about you

167
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,120
都会说你不少坏话了
on the drive home every night.

168
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,360
我
About me?

169
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,810
我准备让你来负责流浪者
I'm making you lead on Rover.

170
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,880
是你把他们捡了出来
You pulled them off the slush pile.

171
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,330
你几个月来一直做着投资经理的工作
You've been doing the work of an associate for months now.

172
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,210
你准备好了
You're ready.

173
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,810
今天带他们去孵化器安顿下来
Get them set up in the Incubator today,

174
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,900
并开始给我找个新助理
and start looking for my new assistant.

175
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,300
找到之前  你暂时要身兼二职
Until we find one, you'll be pulling double duty.

176
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,310
恭喜你
Congratulations.

177
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,460
现在一般是人类
This is typically where members of the human race

178
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,660
表达狂喜或...
express some enthusiasm or...

179
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,660
谢谢你
Thank you.

180
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,960
今天谁赢了
Who's winning today?

181
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,720
海莉·克拉克
Haley Clark.

182
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,330
小姑娘  给我一个充分的理由
Young lady, tell me there's a good reason

183
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,980
解释你怎么没在上第二节课
you're not in second period right now.

184
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,300
他是费城人
So, he's from Philadelphia.

185
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,000
西费城  没错
West Philly, yeah.

186
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,270
但是他妈妈因为
But his mom is really freaked out

187
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,350
篮球场上发生的事吓坏了
about what happened on the basketball court,

188
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,870
所以她收拾好他的东西
so she packed up his stuff

189
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,830
让他搬到了洛杉矶
and -- and moved him to Los Angeles,

190
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,730
后来他就一直住在那里
and he's been living there ever since.

191
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,540
不好意思  篮球场上发生的那件事
I'm sorry, but was the thing on the basketball court

192
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,750
真的那么严重吗
really that big a deal?

193
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,650
竟然永远把自己的孩子送走
I mean, to send your kid away forever?

194
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,630
好像牵涉到黑帮
I think it involved gangs.

195
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,610
-他其实不是什么皇室  -当然了
- And he's not actually royalty. - No.

196
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,510
"清新王子"是他的街头诨名
"Fresh Prince" refers to his street cred.

197
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,070
日本的电视节目都很奇怪
TV in Japan is weird.

198
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,110
有那种游戏节目
There's all these, like, um, game shows

199
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,230
会让人做很疯狂的事
where they make you do insane things

200
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,630
比如  比如打扮成巨大的香蕉
like, um -- like dress up like a giant banana,

201
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,990
然后他们把你丢进动物园
and then they drop you into a zoo

202
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,950
跟一群一个星期没吃东西的黑猩猩关在一起
with a bunch of chimps that haven't eaten in a week.

203
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,580
然后你就吓坏了  尖叫着到处跑
And you're terrified, screaming, running around,

204
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,940
而演播室里有一群观众
but then there is this studio audience there

205
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,850
在看着你  嘲笑你
who's watching and laughing at you.

206
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,130
太可怕了
That sounds horrible.

207
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,330
我曾经上过电视
You know, I was on TV once.

208
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,550
代表IBM吗
For IBM?

209
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,600
不  我当时11岁  是感恩节游行
No. I was 11 -- uh, Thanksgiving Day parade.

210
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,290
我扮成朝圣者  另一个孩子穿着
I was a pilgrim, this other kid was wearing

211
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,040
他妈妈的棕色紧身衣和纸质羽毛
his mom's brown tights and construction-paper feathers,

212
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,650
我们在彩车上相互追赶  差点摔下去
and we chased each other around a float and almost fell off.

213
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,870
你能...稍等  稍等
Hey, can you just -- Like, one second, one second.

214
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,560
喂
Hello?

215
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,060
喂
Hello?

216
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,050
我小时候也上过电视
I was on TV when I was a kid.

217
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,230
《早安达拉斯》
"Good Morning Dallas."

218
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,730
揭露问题少年的节目吗
Troubled-youth exposé?

219
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,590
不是
No.

220
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,630
我赢了一场选美
I won a beauty contest.

221
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,150
你...
You...

222
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,750
什么
You what?

223
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,110
没错
Yeah.

224
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,040
无暇小姐  1970年
Little Miss Flawless, 1970.

225
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,580
我爸爸死后  我妈妈给我报名参加了选美比赛
My mom, um, signed me up for a pageant after my dad died.

226
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,430
她大概认为这样能分散我的注意力
I think she thought it would distract me

227
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,170
或是增进我们之间的关系之类的
or, uh, we'd bond or something.

228
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,080
然后你赢了
And you won.

229
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,680
那一次吗  没有  我输了
That time? No. No, I lost.

230
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,710
但她不停地给我报名
But she kept signing me up.

231
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:53,420
我和她说我不喜欢  但是她不听
I told her I hated it, but she...didn't listen.

232
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,620
有那么糟糕吗
That bad, huh?

233
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,080
一群八岁的小孩漂白牙齿
What, a bunch of 8-year-olds whitening their teeth

234
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,420
然后相互攀比长相吗
and getting ranked on their looks?

235
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,410
没错  就是那么糟糕
Yeah, it was that bad.

236
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,880
这么说你漂白过你的牙齿
So, you whitened your teeth.

237
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,140
天啊
Oh, my God.

238
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,960
她还有各种花样
She had a whole box of tricks.

239
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,670
用喷胶  给你的泳衣定型
Spray adhesive to -- to keep your bathing suit in place,

240
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,730
痔疮膏
Hemorrhoid cream.

241
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,570
-痔疮膏  -没错
- Hemorrhoid cream? - Yeah.

242
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,480
因为比赛前  我经常会哭
Yeah, 'cause I'd, um, cry a lot? Before the competitions?

243
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,860
我根本不想去
I didn't want to be there.

244
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,080
我想回家  所以我就哭啊哭啊
I just wanted to go home, and so I'd cry and cry.

245
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,070
这样整个人看上去就很浮肿
And that puffs you up pretty bad.

246
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,810
然后我妈妈发现
So my mom found out that

247
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,510
如果在眼睛周围涂上痔疮膏
if you put hemorrhoid cream all around my eyes,

248
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,010
就能消肿
it took the puffiness away.

249
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,740
这样我就能恢复正常  走上台
So I could be normal again and march out onstage

250
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,640
摆出漂亮造型
and do the Pretty Feet Pose.

251
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,360
一脚在前  一脚在后
One foot forward, one foot back,

252
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,760
手放在肋骨下方
hand underneath the rib cage,

253
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,750
脸上扯出愚蠢的笑容
big, stupid smile on my face.

254
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,900
然后...我就输了
And...I'd lose.

255
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,160
直到最后你赢了
Until you won.

256
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,240
是的
Yeah.

257
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,120
无暇小姐  1970年
Little Miss Flawless, 1970.

258
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,840
所有瑕疵都被遮住了
Got all those flaws taken care of.

259
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,080
等一下
One sec.

260
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,130
豪伊女士
Ms. Howe?

261
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,410
雅达利的加文·格林在找你

Thank you.

263
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,320
那么
So,

264
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,680
贝艾尔有没有什么清新王子
is there, like, a Fresh Princess of Bel Air?

265
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,730
逃课被停学是不是很蠢
Is it dumb to get suspended for skipping school?

266
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,620
是的
It is, okay?

267
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,250
但是我们并不是要讨论这个
But we're not here to debate that.

268
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,730
听着  我知道有一个
Okay? Look, I know what it's like

269
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,340
需要关注的哥哥或姐姐的滋味
to have an older sibling who requires a lot of attention.

270
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,510
你伯伯亨利就是个笨蛋
Okay, your Uncle Henry? Total bonehead.

271
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,910
总是会惹上大麻烦
Always getting into major trouble.

272
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,470
所以  家里人就不怎么关心我
And -- and so, I kind of flew under the radar.

273
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,010
海莉
Look, Haley...

274
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,970
如果你想撒撒气  没问题
...if you want to blow off some steam, fine,

275
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,930
但是不要做蠢事
just don't be dumb about it.

276
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,340
这不是你
You know, this isn't you.

277
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,620
你...很聪明
You're -- You're -- You're -- You're smart, you know?

282
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,960
听着...这不是什么大不了的事
Look, it's -- it's not even that big of a deal.

283
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,520
我...都没生气
I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm not even mad.

我让你难过了吗
Okay, look, did I upset you?

289
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,390
我说了什么或者...
Is it something that I said or...

00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,440
我过几分钟就来  好吗
Okay, well, I'll be there in a few minutes, all right?

294
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,400
好吧
Okay, sure.

295
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,400
-亲爱的  -我们在处理了
- Bug. - And we're on it.

296
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,470
-不  -可能不会有事的
- No. - Probably going to be fine.

297
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,070
想登录的用户显示信号忙
Busy signals for users trying to log on,

298
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,850
用户服务来电被打爆
the customer-service calls spiking.

299
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,100
流量缓慢
Uh, throughput's at a crawl.

300
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,060
虽然不是切尔诺贝利规模的灾难
We're not talking Chernobyl-style meltdown yet,

301
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,320
但得有三里岛
but we're in Three Mile Island

302
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,570
-那个规模  -等等  等等
- territory for suresies. - Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

303
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,180
都是因为固定费率模式吗
All because of the flat-fee model?

304
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,140
人们真的会在网上
I mean, are people really spending

305
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,690
多泡那么久吗
that much more time online?

306
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,220
许多人现在就开着电脑挂机一整天
A lot of people just leave their computers logged on all day now.

307
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,470
亲爱的  你能去办公室等我吗
Hey, Bug, do you mind waiting in my office for me?

308
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,250
有好几十个用户
We got three dozen users

309
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,320
已在网上挂了超过一天
who've been on for more than twenty-four hours.

310
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,900
那就强迫他们下线
So kick 'em off.

311
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,940
那我们得写新代码来实现
We'd have to write new code to do that

312
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,770
而且还得让所有人下载软件补丁
and then get everyone to download a software patch.

313
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,530
那我们需要世通提供更大带宽
Yeah. We need more capacity from MCI.

314
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,610
给我联系...乔恩·沃尔比
Get me, uh... Get me Jon Volpi on the phone.

315
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,310
打过了  联系不上
Uh, tried. Can't reach him.

316
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,840
那就打给艾伦  或者戴夫
All right, well, get me Alan or Dave

317
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,690
或者那个博比·苏巴洛
or that Bobby Sobrato guy.

318
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,070
他们也都打过了
Uh, we tried them, too.

319
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,970
世通那边一个人都联系不上
We can't get ahold of anybody at MCI.

320
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,670
乔在哪
Where's Joe?

321
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,040
他没来上班  我们也联系过他
Uh, he never came in. We tried him, too.

322
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,590
一直转语音留言
It just keeps going to voicemail.

323
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:31,820
那就
Look, just...

324
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,590
谢普  尽快想办法解决吧
Shep, we need to fix it fast, okay?

325
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,240
美国在线追杀得正紧呢
AOL is breathing down our butts, you know.

326
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,190
如果我们不能满足用户的需要
And if we don't give our customers what they need,

327
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,630
他们就会改去别家
they're gonna go somewhere else.

328
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,540
你知道怎么用Excel吗
Do you know how to work Excel?

329
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,890
知道
Yeah.

330
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,090
你能帮我把这些做成表格吗
Can you put these in a spreadsheet for me?

331
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,430
真的很重要
It's really important.

332
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,400
好吧
Okay.

333
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,850
最上面的抽屉有硬币
There's some quarters in the top drawer

334
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,750
需要什么的话就去售货机买
if you need anything from the vending machine.

335
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,100
好吗  我去去就回
Okay? I'll be right back.

336
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,070
这不像是海莉会做的事
It just doesn't sound like Haley.

337
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,420
是学校把她和琼妮弄混了吧
I was sure the school got her mixed up with Joanie.

338
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,380
并不是  我知道
Yeah, no, I know.

339
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,810
我跟你说  唐娜  我也不知道怎么回事
I'm telling you, Donna, I don't know what's going on.

340
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,800
她从来不是爱哭的孩子啊
She's never been the crying type.

341
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,340
是啊  就是...
Yeah, I mean, it was that...

342
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,150
那种哭得很厉害的状态
that... that really intense crying.

343
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,230
你越是想憋住  就越憋不住
Where you try and hold it in, but you can't,

344
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,370
到最后就哭得气都喘不过来
and, you know, then you just start going into convulsions.

345
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,870
没准她来月经了
Ah, maybe she's just on her period.

346
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,330
不是  唐娜  月经哭可不是这样的
No, Donna, this isn't menstrual crying.

347
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,170
相信我  我知道月经是怎么哭
Trust me. I know menstrual crying.

348
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,740
你还知道月经是怎么哭
Yeah. You know menstrual crying.

349
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,210
要不要我和她谈谈
Look, do you want me to talk to her?

350
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,980
不
No.

351
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,460
算了  我来处理吧
No, I'll... I'll handle it.

352
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,090
那好  祝你好运了
Okay, well, good luck.

353
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,470
周六下午  一望无际的大海
Saturday afternoon, nothing but ocean.

354
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,680
唐娜我跟你说  真是太美了
Oh, Donna, it was Goddamn beautiful.

355
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,240
所以我听着小曲睡着了
So, I took my little disco nap

356
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,530
然后我做了个梦
and I had a dream...

357
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,170
我变成了一个  又大又胖的
That I was this... I was this big, fat...

358
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:40,780
没毛娃娃在海牛肚子上晃啊晃
...bald baby just sloshin' around a manatee's tummy,

359
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,630
就这么摇过来  晃过去
just, "Whoosh, fworsh."

360
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,230
但是我一睁眼
But when I come to...

361
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,580
老天啊  我那船摇晃得天旋地转
...by God, the boat is pitchin' and it's yawin'

362
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,860
就跟头醉驴似的四处乱漂
and it's rollin' like a drunk donkey.

363
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,840
好大一场风暴突然就起来了
Just a freak storm out of nowhere,

364
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,680
那黑云就像堵墙挡着我没法靠岸
just a wall of black blocking my path back to the coast.

365
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,980
我算没辙了
I'm lost.

366
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,540
我就想  "关灯散伙吧  派对结束了"
And I'm thinking, "Turn out the lights. The party's over."

367
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,170
然后我就慌了
Then I started to panic.

368
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,170
然后我发疯似地发求救信号
Then I started to S.O.S. like an S.O.B.,

369
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:05,290
然后这两个书呆子开着船就过来了
and that's when these two eggheads just come cruising up.

370
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,580
难以置信
Unbelievable.

371
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:12,540
原来他俩的船上装了定制的GPS接收器
See, these two have a custom GPS receiver on their boat.

372
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,830
那是全球定位系统
That's the Global Positioning System.

373
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,620
没错  唐娜  就是那个
That is right, Donna, yeah.

374
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,960
原来弗雷德和比尔是工程师
Turns out Fred and Bill are engineers.

375
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,690
他们给AMD挣了好多钱
They made AMD a lot of money

376
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,570
把死贵的东西弄得超便宜
by making real expensive stuff real cheap.

377
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,980
-这技能很有用  -就是
- Not a bad skill set. - Right.

378
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,650
所以我们喝了几杯  就开始聊
So we had a few beers, and we get to talking.

379
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,420
我们就想着  干嘛不把他们的点子
And what we thought was, why not take their idea

380
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,930
推广做大呢
and scale it up?

381
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,840
做成像我这种人随处可以买到的东西
Make something a guy like me can buy off the rack?

382
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,630
佳明不是已经做出来了吗
Uh, doesn't Garmin already do that?

383
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,890
是  但是他们和麦哲伦
Mm, yeah, but them and Magellan

384
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,350
垄断了市场
got a stranglehold on the market,

385
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,740
而且  唐娜  他们定价贵得要死
and, Donna, they charge up the wazoo.

386
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,150
我们想把价格点拉下来
We're talking about disrupting the price point,

387
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,800
大幅度降低成本
bringing the costs way down.

388
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,450
有趣
It's interesting.

389
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,400
而且  这个技术真厉害
And, hey, I... what a fascinating technology.

390
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,840
是啊
It is, yeah.

391
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,220
我会研究一下的
I'll look into it.

392
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,470

00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,780
你就直说吧
Well, give it to me straight.

405
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,160
我得看看我可以期待什么
I got to manage my expectations here.

406
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,030
这个  很有趣
Well, um, it's intriguing.

407
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,910
你想在其中得到什么好处  博斯
What are you looking for out of this, Bos?

408
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,930
你真的想给创业公司当高管吗
I mean, do you really want to be the exec at a startup?

409
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,070
我只是想拿些中介费
I- I'm just looking for a finder's fee, you know?

410
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,080
我喜欢给人牵线搭桥  而且我喜欢这俩人
I like connecting people. And I like these guys.

411
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,200
而且  我就是这东西的目标群体啊
And just... I'm the market for this kind of thing.

412
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,390
知道吗
You know?

413
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,090
我这样的老水手还有不少呢
There's a lot of other salty sailors out there just like me.

414
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,690
那好吧  那我研究一下
Okay. Well, you know, I'll look into it.

415
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,980
真的  这技术很棒
Again, uh, what a technology.

416

424
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,180
死的明确形象毫无征兆地突然展现在大卫眼前
David was visited by an exact vision of death:

425
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,180
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}出自《鸽羽》  约翰·厄普代克著  杨向荣译

426
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,360
地上一个很深的洞  宽不过你的身体
a long hole in the ground, no wider than your body,

427
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,110
你被拽到洞里  而上面的白色面孔渐渐隐去
down which you are drawn while the white faces above recede.

428
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,380
你竭尽全力要够到他们
You try to reach for them,

429
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,380
可你的两条胳膊却像被钉住了一样动弹不得
but your arms are pinned.

430
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,430
一铲铲的土撒到你脸上
Shovels pour dirt into your face.

431
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,050
就这样  你将永远竖直地待在那里
There you will be forever, in an upright position,

432
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,010
眼不能见  耳不能闻
blind and silent,

433
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:49,640
谁都不会记得你
and in time no one will remember you,

434
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,650
谁也不会来看你
and you will never be called.

435
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,120
随着岩层的移位  你的手指会拉长
As strata of rock shift, your fingers elongate,

436
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,340
你的牙齿会斜刺里爆出
your teeth are distended sideways

437
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,420
把你的脸在地下扭成个大鬼脸
in a great underground grimace

438
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,510
跟一截粉笔没什么区别
indistinguishable from a strip of chalk.

439
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:07,270
大地继续翻滚  太阳慢慢断气
And the earth tumbles on, and the sun expires,

440
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,830
永远的黑暗将统治
and unaltering darkness reigns

441
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,470
曾是星斗满天的苍穹
where once there were stars.

442
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,980
我的天
Jesus...

443
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,070
但是这还不是故事的结局
But that's not the end of the story.

444
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,420
这个孩子的外婆让他
This kid... his grandmother tells him

445
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,050
去把谷仓里的鸽子都打死
to go shoot all the pigeons in the barn.

446
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,650
这让他开始思考死亡
And it makes him think about death,

447
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,160
而他的信仰也出现了危机
and he has this crisis of faith.

448
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,110
没人能让他安心
And nobody reassures him.

449
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,860
他被这种不可信感包围了
He is...surrounded by this non-belief.

450
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,460
就好像是一个阴谋  刚刚被他识破了
It's like a conspiracy, and he's just wising up to it.

451
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,150
但他还是把鸽子都打死了
But he still has to shoot all these pigeons.

452
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,960
一只不剩地全都消灭干净了
And he does, he just shoots the hell out of them.

453
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,740
然后他捡起一只死鸽子  开始端详它
And he picks up a dead pigeon, and he stares at it.

454
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,430
真的是太美了
And it's actually gorgeous.

455
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,760
就在这一刻  他想明白了
And he decides right then and there

456
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:52,010
一个把这么多的美丽倾注在一个
that no God who would give so much beauty

457
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,830
如此无用的生物身上的上帝
to such a worthless creature

458
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,280
是不会不让他获得永生的
would fail to let him live forever.

459
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,820
仿佛他的信仰恢复了
Like his faith is restored.

460
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,060
你也信这个吗
Is that what you believe?

461
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,520
我也  不知道
I just... I don't know.

462
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,840
我想我是...
I guess I...

463
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,110
我希望还有更多
I hope there's something more.

464
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,080
怎么了
"Huh" what?

465
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,270
只是觉得奇怪  从没想到你
Just weird. I never thought about you

466
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,930
会是那种需要"更多"的人
as the kind of guy who needed "more."

467
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,900
好吧
All right.

468
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,790
那你信仰什么
What do you believe?

469
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,860
这个嘛
Um, well...

470
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,580
我在日本见过这么一座庙
I saw this shrine in Japan.

471
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,750
当地人会把它拆毁
And, uh, the locals tear it down,

472
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,130
连地基都不剩  每20年一次
right to the foundation, every 20 years.

473
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,850
然后他们会重新盖一座
And then they build it right back up again,

474
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,480
盖得和原来一模一样
back to its original state.

475
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,180
他们已经这么做了1300年了
And they've been doing this for 1,300 years.

476
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,240
所有的部件都不是原先的
Nothing in it's original anymore,

477
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,010
但还是和当初第一天盖起来时完全一样
but it still looks identical to the day it went up.

478
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,210
听着真美
That's beautiful.

479
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,590
并不是
Well, no.

480
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,640
我倒不觉得这些人这么做
I mean, I don't think these people are doing it

481
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,020
是为了什么精神
for some spiritual reason.

482
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,180
我觉得他们这么做
I think they're doing it

483
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,370
只是因为他们放不下这个程序
because they're holding onto the process of it, you know?

484
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,050
这种做法本身就是其意义所在
The doing of it, that that's all that matters.

485
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,310
我是这么认为的
That's what I think.

486
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,750
我也不知道
I don't know.

487
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,560
我最近想从这里找到一些慰藉
I've been trying to find some solace in that lately.

488
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,210
结果怎么样
How's that working out for you?

489
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,130
不怎么样  乔
Not that great, Joe,

490
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,820
但是多谢关心
but thanks for asking.

491
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,010
我道歉
I'm sorry.

492
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,660
这样问  不太好
That was... That was unfair.

493
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,820
是啊  不太好
Yeah, it was.

494
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,500
我已经45岁了
Look, I'm forty-five.

495
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,830
没有成家  在地下室工作
I've got no family. I work in a basement.

496
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:46,140
一般没什么人找我寻求精神指导
People aren't exactly lining up for my spiritual guidance.

497
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,390
就是因为这个吗
Is that what this is about?

498
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,670
因为什么
What?

499
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,890
你说你还没成家
Well, you said you didn't have a family.

500
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,770
你并不想结婚的吧
You don't want one, do you?

501
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,840
我父亲去年春天去世了
My dad died last spring.

502
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,670
天啊  乔
Oh, God, Joe.

503
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,230
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

504
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,210
是啊
Yeah.

505
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,210
你知道这类事是什么样子  只不过
And you know what this is like, but...

506
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,370
你会开始思考一切
You just start to think about everything.

507
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,510
当我  15岁的时候
And when I was... when I was fifteen,

508
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:21,670
我发誓我绝对不要孩子
I made this vow that I would never have kids.

509
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,830
都是因为他
All because of him.

510
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,810
他是那么的  高大
He was just...huge

511
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:30,230
而且很  强势
and...imposing.

512
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,570
你知道你也高大强势吧
You know you're huge and imposing, right?

513
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,200
他让我觉得自己很渺小
He made me feel small.

514
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,650
就好像我
Like I was...

515
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,110
什么都不是
less than nothing.

516
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,470
而我绝对不想让我的孩子也有这种感受
And I never wanted to risk doing that to a child.

517
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,220
然后他死了
And then he died.

518
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,580
我  去了他的葬礼
And... And I'm, like, there at his funeral.

519
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,450
几乎没什么宾客去吊唁
And there's hardly anyone else there.

520
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,040
而突然间  他反而渺小了
And he felt like the small one all of a sudden.

521
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,020
因此你又想成家了
And that made you want to have a family?

522
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,200
这让我意识到我们不是一类人
It made me realize that we are different people...

523
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,280
而且
and, um...

524
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,530
也许我本来能做得更好
maybe I would have been better.

525
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,540
你想过要孩子吗
You ever think about kids?

526
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,010
想过
Yeah.

527
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,130
有一天  我突然对汤姆提起来了
I just, um, sprung it on Tom one day.

528
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,450
甚至都没怎么多想
Didn't even really think about it.

529
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,630
就一句"我们要孩子吧"
Just "Let's start a family."

530
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,360
这句话真是太蠢了
Such a stupid thing to say to someone

531
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,870
尤其如果你没打算让对方当真
if you're not ready for them to take it seriously.

532
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,170
他却当真了
And he did.

533
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,070
他简直乐死了
Oh, I mean, he lit up.

534
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,960
我从没见过人能开心成那样
I've never seen someone so happy.

535
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,950
于是我们就开始尝试
And so we, uh, started trying.

536
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,960
结果没成功
And it didn't work.

537
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,620
我则觉得松了口气
And I was relieved.

538
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,130
我松了口气是因为大自然替我做了
I was relieved that Mother Nature made a decision for me

539
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:34,260
我自己没胆量去做的选择
that I was too spineless to make for myself.

540
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,540
我意识到我只是想尽快完事
And I realized I was just going through with it

541
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,290
因为我不想再让他失望了
because I didn't want to disappoint him again.

542
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,800
抱歉  我不该这么说
Sorry. I shouldn't...have said that.

543
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,610
知道吗
You know,

544
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,820
能跟你认真聊聊太好了
it is so good to actually talk to you.

545
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,240
是啊
Yeah.

546
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:05,910
我也这么想
You too.

547
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,590
看来我得花些时间
I think it's gonna take a while

548
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,410
才能适应了
for me to get used to that.

549
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,580
拜托  "阿盖克"是什么鬼
I mean, come on. "Aggek"? What is that?

550
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,990
听起来像打嗝打疼了
It sounds like a painful hiccup.

551
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,770
让我联想起那种绿藻
It does kind of remind me of pond scum.

552
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,060
天啊  崔普简直要把我气死了
Oh, God, Trip makes my blood boil,

553
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,640
他那名字听着就气人
even just his name.

554
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,510
"崔普·基斯克"
"Trip Kisker."

555
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,340
伊莱亚斯倒是挺喜欢他的
Elias does like him, though.

556
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,070
他是个明星
He's a star.

557
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,550
如果我们想让你
Look, if we're gonna position you

558
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,700
接过我退休后留下的位置
to take over the mantle once I'm gone,

559
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,500
和明日之星搞好关系是没坏处的
a little diplomacy with the new star pupil won't hurt.

560
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,780
所以怎么样
So, how was it?

561
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,870
说实话
Be honest.

562
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,530
这个领域挺有潜力
It's a promising arena.

563
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,830
但我觉得他们有点晚了
But I think they're too late.

564
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,790
定位系统市场里已经有不少巨头了
There's a lot of muscle in GPS already,

565
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,720
零售环节又很难处理
and retail is tricky.

566
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,980
但我可以再深入研究下
But I can do some more digging,

567
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,820
或许组织人做个分析
maybe order up an analysis.

568
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,090
不
No.

569
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,740
我觉得约翰根本不在乎定位系统
I think John could care less about GPS.

570
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,890
他只是不愿闲着  想找点事做
He's just restless and looking for something to do.

571
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,360
"阿-盖-克"
"Aggek."

572
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,630
踩到小蜥蜴时它尖叫的声音
It's the cry you hear when you step on a tiny lizard.

573
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,740
我们还是可以在崔普背后
Hey, we can still talk trash about Trip

574
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,160
讲他坏话吧
behind his back, right?

575
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,840
-还是之后再回到这个话题上来吧  -是吗
- Let's circle back on that later. - Oh, really?

576
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,460
我觉得现在是深入考量的好机会
I think now's the perfect time to drill down on it.

577
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,050
我一向喜欢绕回来后
I always prefer to drill down

578
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,800
再深入考量
after I'm circling back.

579
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,600
柯蒂斯
Curtis.

580
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:40,250
我把软件的人都调去接服务电话
Yeah, well, I'm pulling software guys to handle support calls.

581
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,180
已经有用户取消了
And we've already had some cancellations.

582
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,510
那等你确定了再给我回电
Well, call me back when you do have an answer.

583
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,480
好吧  拜托告诉我
Okay, please tell me

584
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,130
你跟世通的人联系上了
you've talked to somebody from MCI.

585
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,770
联系了  我刚联系过
Yeah, we did. I just did.

586
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,670
巴里·施诺姆  施诺-汉姆
Uh, Barry Schnellham? Schnell-ham.

587
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,500
好吧  施诺姆是谁
Okay. Well, who the hell is Barry Shhhnellham?

588
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,150
巴里·施诺姆是...
Barry Schnellham is...

589
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,410
企业解决方案服务的临时经理
Interim manager of enterprise solution outreach.

590
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,540
他们要等到最后一刻
They're gonna wait out the clock

591
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,970
逼我们为更大带宽
and then squeeze us until we cave

592
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:06,040
大幅调高费率
on a huge rate hike for more pipe!

593
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,180
怎么...
What...?

594
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,320
看来客户服务部又倒霉了
Oh, it looks like customer service just face-planted again.

595
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,410
巴里·施诺曼
Barry Shhhnellham?

596
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,520
巴里·施诺姆  听着  谢普
Barry Schnellham? Listen to me, Shep.

597
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,020
你现在就给我打电话
You get on the phone right now

598
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,320
告诉巴里·施诺姆
and you tell Barry Schnellham

599
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,350
如果五分钟后乔恩·沃尔比
if I don't have Jon Volpi on the line

600
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,450
还不打过来
in the next five minutes,

601
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,180
我就亲自开车去一趟世通
I'm personally gonna drive down to MCI

602
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,270
拿我的脸打穿他的拳头
and put my Goddamn face through his Goddamn fist!

603
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,810
他怎么样
How is he?

604
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,080
很好  卡奈特很成功
He's great. CalNect is really successful.

605
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,340
-网络服务提供商部疯长  -不不不
- The ISP sector is growing like crazy. - No, no, no, no, no.

606
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,780
他到底怎么样
How is he?

607
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,590
应该还好
I think he's fine.

608
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,850
他不怎么说这些
He doesn't talk about it much.

609
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,250
肯定很可怕
It must be so scary.

610
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,090
他  真的真的很开心
I mean, h-he's, uh -- he's really, really happy.

611
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,210
至少之前很开心
Or at least he was.

612
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,410
直到我告诉他我的新点子
Until I told him about my new web idea.

613
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:02,970
是什么
Which is?

614
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,290
想象一下
So, imagine,

615
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,860
网页的网页
like, um, a website of websites,

616
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,840
组织性的索引  能帮你快速链接别的网页
uh, a curated index that takes you wherever you want to go.

617
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,760
就像黄页吗
Like the yellow pages?

618
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,050
不是  比那更好
No, it's -- it's so much more than that.

619
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,020
就像  像传送门...
It's like a -- It's a portal...

620
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,530
等等  稍等下
Wait. Wait. One second, one second.

621
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,030
我的想法是...好
...is what I'm thinking about -- Okay.

622
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,150
卡梅伦
Cameron.

623
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,560
你电话一天都打不通
Uh, your phone's been tied up all day.

624
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,970
是啊  抱歉
Yeah, sorry.

625
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,770
有时间吗
Um, you have a sec?

626
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,020
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

627
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,440
雅达利没人愿意推进
Nobody at Atari wants to push forward

628
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,590
一个没有调试好的产品
on a product that isn't perfectly calibrated.

629
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,010
所以我们决定先放一放
So we've decided to push back for a time.

630
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,300
放多久
How much time?

631
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,570
不确定
Indefinitely.

632
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,930
还有  我们需要你的声明
Also, we're gonna, uh, need a quote...

633
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,700
今晚之前
tonight.

634
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,380
好  我...
Yeah, uh, I'll, uh...

635
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,580
卡梅伦
Hey, Cameron.

636
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,710
他们...
They're, uh...

637
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,960
要延迟推出我的游戏
They're gonna delay my game.

638
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,060
而且...
Like, um...

639
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,660
不确定多久
indefinitely.

640
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,800
他们需要我的声明  用于新闻发布
They need some press-release quote from me,

641
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,890
所以  我得挂了
so I -- I should probably go.

642
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,110
我来写吧
I can write it.

643
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,980
让我帮你吧
Let me help you.

644
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,660
我们可以继续谈
Yeah, well, we can to talk about it more.

645
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,220
-然后茱蒂·巴尔盖斯进来了  -嗯
- So then Judy barges in room, right? - Yeah, yeah.

646
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,000
就像这样
Like that.

647
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,620
一点没错  就像这样
Exactly -- exactly like that.

648
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,240
好了  该谈谈
Okay, time to address

649
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,570
这屋里的高学历大人物了
the over-educated elephant in the room.

650
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,520
正式欢迎我们的新普通合伙人
A formal welcome to our new general partner --

651
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,770
克尔顿·马歇尔·基斯克尔三世
Colton Marshall Kisker III.

652
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,350
我们十分有幸
We were certainly lucky

653
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,580
能在去年把你从红杉抢来
to nab you from Sequoia last year.

654
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:20,040
欢乐行的首次公开募股  22X
And the JoyRide IPO -- 22X.

655
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,410
-干杯  -干杯
- Cheers. - Cheers.

656
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,970
干杯
Cheers.

657
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,620
我有许多话想说
I've got a lot to say,

658
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,060
但我不想喋喋不休
but I don't want to ruin good champagne

659
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,660
而毁了好香槟  所以
with bad rambling, so...

660
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,890
很好
Great.

661
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,330
我很荣幸
I'm honored.

662
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,330
我很感激
I'm humbled.

663
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,560
我也准备好了
And I'm ready.

664
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,690
真的
I am.

665
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:44,490
我准备好深入考量我的投资组合
I'm ready to really drill down on monetizing my portfolio

666
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:47,920
同时培养有发展前景  收益颇丰的
while simultaneously cultivating new and promising ventures

667
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,590
新项目
that provide big exits,

668
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:54,470
让合伙人争着想签投资合同
with LP's clamoring to sign subscription docs.

669
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,070
非常感谢大家
So, thank you, one and all.

670
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,150
谢谢
Thank you.

671
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,250
好  欢乐时光到此为止  该干正事了
All right, fun's over. Back to business.

672
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,520
-好的  开始吧  -快坐
- Yeah. Let's do it. - Come on.

673
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,600
SparqPlug第二轮融资条款清单草案
SparqPlug's Series B term sheet draft

674
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,410
已经出来  可以先睹为快了
is available for the curious.

675
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:14,700
乔伊斯  你能分发PulseMD的目标吗
Joyce, can you send around the target for PulseMD?

676
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,530
好
Got it.

677
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,130
而千禧的帐面价值缩水了
And Millennium is a write-down.

678
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,280
我们先暂缓在网络上的投资吧
Let's take a knee on the web for now, yes?

679
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,410
其实不用
Actually, no.

680
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,940
流浪者正在改写他们的软件准备开展网络服务
Uh, Rover is repurposing their software for a web play.

681
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,950
他们正在孵化器里安顿下来
They're getting set up in the Incubator now.

682
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,330
你还在负责吧  唐娜
And you're still on point, Donna?

683
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,060
我提了谭雅·里斯做投资经理
I made Tanya Reese associate.

684
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,360
她会接手项目并在今天之内提交最新进展
She'll take lead and have an update by end of day.

685
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,940
我就提个建议
Just to throw out a quick suggestion --

686
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,490
流浪者有足够的空间重组他们的核心技术
Rover has enough runway to rework their core technology

687
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:46,780
并给整个网络做索引  供人搜索
and index the entire web, make it searchable.

688
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,160
这是低投入高回报的事
It's low-risk, high-reward.

689
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:51,500
抱歉  我只是在弄清一些细节
Uh, sorry, I'm -- I'm just getting caught up on the particulars,

690
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,020
但既然网络不太好做
but seeing as the web is rocky territory,

691
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,940
也许  回到浏览器上会
is -- is jumping back into browsers maybe something --

692
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,780
流浪者在开发的不是浏览器
Rover isn't developing a browser.

693
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,280
而是在制作全网络索引
It's indexing the web.

694
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,500
所有的
The whole thing.

695
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,470
我们可以先稍微回去一点
Uh, could -- could we circle back for a second

696
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,650
再深入考量一下领导问题吗
and drill down on leadership?

697
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:10,000
谭雅·里斯直到今天之前都是你的助理吗
So, Tanya Reese was an assistant of yours until today?

698
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,620
我们都知道这个  崔普
We're all aware of that fact, Trip.

699
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,700
没错
Absolutely.

700
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,420
我只是刚上轨道
I'm just -- just getting up on my skis here,

701
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:20,010
但她有网络相关背景
but, um, does she have a web background

702
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,260
或是与这个项目相关的管理经验吗
or any managerial experience specific to this play?

703
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,910
谭雅在我的桌上坐了两年
Tanya sat on my desk for two years.

704
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:30,220
她参与过许多交易
She's been involved in numerous deals

705
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,540
并在许多次成功中都扮演了重要角色
and consequential in the success of more than a few.

706
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,310
更不用说
Not to mention the fact

707
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:38,630
她从一堆申请中发掘了流浪者  所以
that she pulled Rover off the slush pile to begin with, so...

708
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,070
我只是在边想边说
Just, um, talking while I'm thinking,

709
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:45,650
但网络现在是个新鲜事物
but since the web is frontierland,

710
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,710
从外面引进一个顾问
would it be the worst idea

711
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,910
也不会很坏吧
to bring in an outside consultant?

712
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,720
我觉得谭雅完全可以
I think Tanya is perfectly capable

713
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,330
搞定这个挑战
of handling the challenge --

714
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,290
乔伊·温彻斯特肯定会乐意加入
I bet Joey Winchester'd be happy to come in.

715
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,810
你知道能来吗  迈克尔·霍滕多夫
You know who's available is Michael Hottendorf.

716
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:58,430
卡斯·莱因哈特三个月前刚从红杉公司离职
Cass Reinhardt just exited Sequoia three months ago

717
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,440
他绝对可以搞定这个
and he would hit this out of the park.

718
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,320
-卡斯  -我说
- Cass -- - You know what?

719
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,810
如果这是流浪者需要的
If that's what Rover needs,

720
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:05,090
我有个完美人选
I have the perfect person in mind.

721
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,690
等我去打个电话
Let me just, uh, make a phone call,

722
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,090
就回来汇报
and I'll report back.

723
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,130
好的  我们继续
Hmm, okay, moving on,

724
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,390
QwellX离目标差了一点
QwellX's missed its quarter by a bit.

725
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,410
利弗莫尔三能分担大约2%
Livermore Three can take about two percent of our load.

726
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:24,790
这就是杯水车薪
Oh, that's a drop in the bucket --

727
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,030
我们正焦头烂额呢
we're getting hit in the face with a fire hose.

728
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,690
这儿就像个灰狗长途汽车站  戈登
It's like a Greyhound bus station in here, Gordon.

729
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:31,920
博斯  你来做什么
Hey, Bos, what are you doing here?

730
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,960
我不知道  我就想顺道看看
I don't know. I just thought I'd stop by.

731
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,620
你生日那天我们没什么机会聊
We didn't get much of a chance to catch up on your birthday.

732
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,490
进我办公室吧
Hey, step into my office.

733
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,580
好
Okay.

734
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,870
看样子你需要趁机休息一下
Looks like you could use a break.

735
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,440
亲爱的  能出去一下吗
Hey, sweetie, can you give us a sec?

736
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,080
你好女士
Ma'am.

737
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,900
你有个年轻漂亮的秘书啊
Well, pretty, young secretary you got there.

738
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,950
我以为搞网络服务提供商是很轻松的
I thought the ISP business supposed to be easy-breezy.

739
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:06,010
外面的人都跟火烧屁股一般跑来跑去
People running around out there like their balls are on fire.

740
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,290
我们...
Well, you know, we're, um,

741
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,640
我们今天有点不太顺
we're going through a couple hiccups today.

742
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,040
我记得这样的日子
Yeah, I remember days like that --

743
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,930
一起扑火
the old bucket brigade routine.

744
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,700
但是  让你感觉好鲜活
By God, it makes you feel alive, though.

745
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,640
对吧  戈登
Doesn't it, Gordon?

746
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,820
不是吗
Doesn't it?

747
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,330
那些蓝人真有意思  是吧
Them blue -- Them blue men were something, huh?

748
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,340
-是的  -那鼓打的
- Yeah. - Their drummin'?

749
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,540
-他们都是蓝的吗  -听我说
- All their, uh -- their blue? - Hey, listen,

750
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,160
博斯  今天可能时机不好
Bos, m-maybe today's not a good time.

751
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,720
我们能过几天再出去喝一杯什么的吗
Can we grab a drink in a few days or something?

752
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,030
行啊  但是...
Yeah, yeah, but...

753
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,110
戈登
Gordon,

754
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,330
我得...找你借点钱
I need to, uh -- I need to borrow some money.

755
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,490
黛安和我之前想在
Diane and I were looking to invest

756
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,500
房地产上投点资
in this housing development.

757
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,180
她又不想做了  但我想
She lost interest. And I didn't.

758
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,340
所以我自己出了钱
Uh, so I put up my own money,

759
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,200
没有告诉她
without telling her.

760
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,550
然后我陷了进去
And then I went in whole hog.

761
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,800
所以我拆了东墙补西墙
So, you know, I-I put good money after bad

762
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,080
四处填坑  然后...
and bad money after worse, and before you --

763
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,650
现在我的钱都打了水漂
Well, now I'm in the drink.

764
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,250
第一笔银行账务还有一个星期就要到期了
First bank note's due in a week.

765
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,670
好吧  你怎么不找黛安帮忙呢
All right, well, I mean, why don't you ask Diane?

766
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,690
她毕竟是你妻子
I mean, she's your wife.

767
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,950
她还不是我妻子
W-Well, she's not my wife.

768
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,460
我不是吃软饭的人  我还得付赡养费
I'm not a kept man. I got alimony to pay.

769
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,610
还得给孩子们付大学贷款
I'm paying down college loans for the kids.

770
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,460
我...
I...

771
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,820
我把我的船卖了去还这笔钱
I sold my boat to pay this thing down.

772
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,700
你把你的船卖了吗  博斯
You sold your boat, Bos?

773
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,900
你欠了多少钱
Well, I mean, how short are you?

774
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,180
一万八
Eighteen thousand...

775
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,790
这只是第一笔款项
for the first payment.

776
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,500
博斯...
Bos...

777
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,110
你为什么来找我
Well, wh-why are you coming to me?

778
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,920
别担心  我还的起  还的起的
Well, now, don't worry, I'm -- I'm good for it. I'm good for it.

779
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,870
我现在手上有个定位仪的项目
No, I got this -- this GPS thing that I'm working on.

780
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,220
我还有...
And then I got, uh --

781
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:49,610
天呐  我还计划了好多项目
Oh, God, I got so much stuff in the hopper right now, really.

782
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,760
我只是资金周转不灵
I mean, I'm -- I'm just -- I'm just cash-shy,

783
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,120
只是有点周转不灵
just a little cash-shy.

784
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,260
所有我想你能...
So I figured you had a --

785
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,750
你觉得
You figured that...

786
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,420
我雇了群蓝人
since I hired the Blue Man Group

787
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:03,960
肯定兜里的钱多的放不下吗
that I must have cash just falling out of my pockets?

788
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:08,100
听着  博斯  我可以毫不犹豫地把钱给你
Look, Bos, look, I'd give you the money in a heartbeat.

789
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,370
但你在和黛安同居  她是我前妻的同事
But you live with Diane, who works with my ex-wife.

790
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,620
她的钱比我们所有人加起来的都多  好吗
And who has more money than all of us combined, all right?

791
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,330
我不能搅和进来
I can't get in the middle of that.

792
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,160
好吗  你得找她帮忙
Okay? You're gonna have to ask her.

793
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,490
我...
I...

794
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,440
那我们就完了
That'd be the end of us.

795
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,100
家里并不太平
Things are choppy at home.

796
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:31,270
但黛安就是我生命中的那个人
I mean, but Diane's it for me.

797
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,470
她一定是
She's got to be.

798
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,620
博斯  我得回去处理事情了
Look, Bos, I-I-I got to get back out there right now.

799
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,700
我不能...
I can't...

800
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,630
好吧
All right.

801
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,030
也不全都是钱的问题
It wasn't all about the money.

802
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,790
你不了解退休后的感觉
You don't know what it's like being retired.

803
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,980
你才刚刚四十岁
Hell, you just turned forty.

804
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,400
不管怎样  你还有很多事可做
You got a dozen more tricks up your sleeve no matter what.

805
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,800
我已经65岁了
I'm sixty-five.

806
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,520
我的人生不能就这样结束
This can't be my last thing.

807
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,730
你得去找她  博斯
You're gonna have to ask her, Bos.

808
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,520
海莉
Haley!

809
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,110
过来
Come here.

810
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,750
过来
Come here.

811
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,700
这是什么
Wh-What is this?

812
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,710
我刚休息了会儿  做了点别的
Oh, well, I just took a little break to make something.

813
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:37,020
我会继续查网站的  但是...
And I'll keep checking for broken sites, but --

814
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,870
不不不  没事
No, no, no. It's fine.

815
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:42,140
海莉  这幅画太赞了
Haley, th-that drawing is awesome.

816
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,010
因为是哈雷彗星
It's because it's Halley's Comet?

817
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,130
因为我叫海莉
Because I'm Haley?

818
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,650
很逊吗
Is that lame?

819
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:52,260
不  亲爱的  这一点也不逊
No, Bug, that's -- I-it's not lame at all.

820
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,000
你喜欢理查德·普赖尔吗
You -- You like Richard Pryor?

821
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,800
喜欢  他最棒了
Well, yeah, he's the best.

822
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,620
海莉  我不知道你能做这些
Haley, I had no idea that you could do all this.

823
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,620
标记语言挺简单的
Well, markup language is pretty easy.

824
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:10,260
又不像C++什么的
Not like it's C++ or anything.

825
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:15,840
那只小马穿的像个粉红色的小牛仔
That pony is dressed like a little pink cowboy.

826
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,750
其实是迷你马  这样更有型
It's actually a miniature horse. So it's way cooler.

827
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,710
这...
This is --

828
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,620
乔恩·沃尔比打来了
Jon Volpi. On the phone.

829
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,690
好的  谢普
All right, Shep.

830
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,270
太拉风了
Is rad.

831
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,670
-"拉风"吗  -拉风
- "Rad"? - Rad.

832
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:38,550
这很拉风  对
This is...rad, yes.

833
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,620
你准备好了吗
You ready?

834
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,650
准备好了  开始吧
Yes. Go ahead.

835
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:45,350
好
Okay, okay, okay.

836
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:48,170
"这么大规模的游戏不可操之过急
"A game of this scope can't be rushed.

837
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:51,210
雅达利团队和我建立了富有成效的工作关系
The Atari team and I have forged a fruitful working relationship

838
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,540
我们将继续给粉丝们带来
that will continue to deliver

839
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,480
他们所渴求且应得的
the engrossing gaming experience...

840
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,330
引人入胜的游戏体验
...our fans demand and deserve.

841
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:59,880
我很感激雅达利对这款游戏的支持
I am gratified by Atari's commitment to the title

842
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,370
也很期待我们日后的合作
and look forward to our ongoing collaboration.

843
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:04,030
另外  我坚决否认
In addition, I firmly deny

844
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:07,020
我有剥开加文·格林的头皮  挖走他的大脑
that I have an urgent desire to scalp Gavin Greene,

845
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,930
然后在空脑壳里拉屎的强烈愿望"
scoop out his brain, and shit in his empty skull."

846
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,230
棒
Yes!

847
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,160
我觉得可以这么发出去
I think we should send it.

848
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:21,400
当然很遗憾  得除去最后一部分
I mean, minus the, uh -- the last part, unfortunately.

849
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:25,280
我知道现在咽下这口气很困难
Listen, I know -- I know it's hard to swallow this right now,

850
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:28,140
但你很擅长你的工作
but you are so good at what you do.

851
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:29,080
乔
Joe --

852
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,200
我说真的
No, really.

853
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,350
别让那个混蛋夺走这一点
Don't let that asshole take that away from you.

854
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,470
他就是个寄生虫  你是个创造者
He's a parasite. You create.

855
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,560
你让事情从无到有
You make something out of nothing,

856
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,060
我一直很敬佩这一点
and I have always been in awe of that.

857
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,040
我不想破坏气氛
And not to ruin the moment,

858
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,230
但是我急着要去尿尿
but I really, really got to piss.

859
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,990
天呐  我也是  走吧
Oh, my God, me too. Okay.

860
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:52,950
乔恩  这个我们明白
Yes, Jon, we understand that part, okay,

861
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,750
但我们的干线完全被堵住了
but our trunk lines are totally clogged over here.

862
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,710
我们的合同上专门写明
Now, we had a contract that specifically --

863
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,700
我们会继续执行合同
And we'll uphold that contract...

864
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,130
但合同上没明确地
but that contract doesn't

865
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:01,460
定义扩张
explicitly codify expansion.

866
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,490
乔恩  我是运营部副总谢普·格拉玛蒂库斯
Uh, Jon, Shep Gramaticus, here, VP of Ops.

867
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,810
如果是费用问题  我们可以谈
Uh, if this is a rate issue, let's talk rates.

868
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:07,690
我们想谈
We want to engage.

869
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:09,370
资源太紧张了  谢普
It's crowded out there, Shep.

870
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:11,910
网络服务提供商市场上只有那么多带宽
Only so much bandwidth in the ISP market.

871
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:14,500
不是你想要就能有的
Can't really say there's pipe just laying around for you.

872
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,120
我们明白
Look, we get it.

873
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,950
我们可以多加钱
We'll break our rate lock.

874
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:20,050
乔恩  你就说实话吧
Look, Jon, just level with us, all right?

875
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,200
我们付多少钱才行
What do we got to pay?

876
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,280
几位  你们可能没听懂
Guys, I'm afraid you're not hearing what I'm saying.

877
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,810
不能再给你们带宽了  就是这样
There is no more pipe. For you. Period.

878
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,250
如果你们还有别的需求
And if you gentlemen need anything else,

879
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,180
可以找巴里·施诺姆
Barry Schnellham is your guy.

880
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,450
祝好
Take care, now.

881
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,680
我们成了没有主干网的网络服务提供商了吗
Are we an ISP with no backbone?

882
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,600
我们已经在大量损失用户了
We're already hemorrhaging customers.

883
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,960
来不及换供应商就已经完蛋了
Be dead before we switch providers.

884
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,880
他们怎么可以这样
Can they do this?

885
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,440
为什么要逼走我们
Why are they freezing us out?

886
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,470
他们自己要做网络服务提供商
They're starting their own ISP.

887
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,430
天呐
Oh, my God.

888
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,290
我们得请个外部法律顾问
We need to retain outside counsel.

889
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,240
他们不能这么做
They can't do this.

890
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,220
他们是公用事业公司
They're a public utility.

891
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,570
不能选边站
They cannot pick winners and losers.

892
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:15,450
这算一个人喝酒吗
Does this qualify as drinking alone?

893
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,300
算吧
It does.

894
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,950
你看见那个了吗
Oh, do you see that?

895
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:31,660
-什么  -月亮
- What? - The moon.

896
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,520
看窗外
Look out your window.

897
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,470
看不见
No.

898
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:40,950
可能是被山挡住了
I think the hill is blocking it.

899
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,530
真遗憾  这里看起来好美
That's too bad. It's so beautiful from here.

900
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,440
你错过了月亮
You missed the moon.

901
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,380
没办法
Oh, well.

902
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:50,710
今天是东南亚风味  菠萝柠檬草薄荷
Southeast Asian today -- pineapple, lemongrass, and mint.

903
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:51,760
谢谢
Thank you.

904
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:55,380
谭雅  等一下
Tanya, stay a sec.

905
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:57,250
我
I, uh...

906
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,370
发生了一点变动
There's been a slight change.

907
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,480
没骗你们
I kid you not.

908
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,590
我们从我刚说的那个小拖车那里穿过
We come up through that little trailer I was telling you about.

909
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:13,940
赤条条地穿过树林
We go through the woods, naked as a jaybird,

910
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,020
一边还弹着班卓琴
playing a banjo.

911
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,170
真没骗你们
I kid you not!

912
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,530
真的是这样  这该死的
It really happened, the son of a --

913
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:20,810
谭雅  你好啊
Hey there, Tanya. How are you?

914
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:23,540
我在和大家熟络一下呢
I'm just getting acquainted with these numbnuts here.

915
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,150
很高兴见到你  约翰
Good to see you, John.

916
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,390
我们开始吧
Should we get started?

917
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:28,540
好的
Sure.

918
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:31,150
这是一份短中期目标清单
Here's a list of short-to-mid-term goals,

919
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,780
-当然还有待商讨  -当然
- up for discussion, of course... - Of course.

920
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,640
主要针对接下来几周
...aiming at a product that we want to deliver

921
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,510
我们要开发出的产品
within the next couple of weeks.

922
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:17,400
你想好要什么了吗
So, do you know what you want?

I was sad.

00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,540
我需要把悲伤发泄出来

而他正好在旁边
happened to be there.

I was in the same room as him.

46
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,250
我一直在想他对我说的话
I just keep thinking about everything he said to me.

47
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,690
你选了他
You took his side.

48
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,620
你爱他
You love him.

49
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,610
不是这样的
That's not true.

50
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,050
我凭什么相信你
Why should I believe you?

51

Because...

乔这个人没法去爱
there's no loving Joe.

53
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,490
你根本不可能爱他
He's impossible to love.

54
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,570
他是个空壳
He's empty and...

55
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,390
时势需要他什么样  他就变成什么样
he just becomes whatever circumstance needs him to be.

真是太好了
This is perfect.

59
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,700
一秒钟都等不得  是不是
Didn't waste any time, did you?

60
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,090
他在吗
Is he here?

At the office!

62
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,580
你没认真听我说
You're not hearing me.

63
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,830
不  这对你而言是个机会
No, this is an opportunity for you.

We are willing to restructure the deal, Jon.

Just got off the phone with Volpi.

是啊  你当然能联系上他了
Of course you can get him on the line.

70
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,640
他完全不让步
He's not budging!

我在找太平洋贝尔
I'm trying PacBell.

72
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,500
那边也没得谈  你太晚了
There's nothing there. You're too late.

73
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,430
我们现在唯一的一步棋
The only play we have left now

74
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,790
就是趁还值点钱的时候赶紧卖出去
is to sell while we're still worth something.

75
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,350
别这么说  我们再想想办法
Don't say that. We can still figure something...

76
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,940
少装了  乔
Oh, spare me the theatrics, Joe.

77
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,240
你既然已经打了五分钟的电话  就该清楚情况了
If you've been on the phone for five minutes, then you know!

78
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,910
这可不是我想听你说的话
That is not what I want to hear from you right now.

79
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,930
卡梅伦可好啊
How's Cameron?

80
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,140
没错  我今早去了你家一趟
Yeah, I stopped by your place this morning.

81
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,000
她看起来  很惬意
She looked, uh... comfortable.

82
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,120
你可以想象我有多吃惊
You know, you can imagine my surprise.

83
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,180
你没影了  我还以为你生我气了
You disappear, I think you're upset with me,

84
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,280
搞了半天原来你去泡已婚妇女去了
and then turns out you've been holed up with a married woman.

85
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,390
她离婚了
She's divorced.

86
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,460
快了
Almost.

87
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,670
快离婚了
Almost divorced!

88
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,850
-真是太好了  -怎么说起卡梅伦了
- Th-That's beautiful. - Why are we talking about Cameron?

89
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,480
因为我了解你们两个
Because I know you two!

90
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,640
你们就像  就像
And it's like... it's like...

91
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,500
就像你是辆火车  她也是辆火车
it's like you're a train and she's a train,

92
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,800
然后你就想  我们俩都是火车
and you think, "Oh, we're both trains.

93
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,120
肯定合得来
We should get along great"!

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,080
然后两辆火车在同一条铁轨上
But then both the trains are on the same track,

95
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,520
朝着对方迎头撞去
and they're both headed right for each other,

96
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,400
你猜怎么着
and guess what...

97
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,320
俩车上都装满了炸药
both the trains are carrying dynamite.

98
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,860
这种事我见得多了
Look, I've seen this a thousand times.

99
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,730
我知道是什么结果
I know how it ends.

100
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,900
-好好好  好吧  -会爆炸的
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. - It's gonna explode!

101
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,070
-我们对彼此没好处  -又不是...
- We're bad for each other... - It's not...

102
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,340
-早晚吃不了兜着走  -没错
- and it's going to be disastrous. - Yes!

103
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,980
这是什么
What is this?

104
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,940
我给你做了早饭
I made you breakfast.

105
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,380
是奶酪蛋
It's cheese egg.

106
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,590
奶酪蛋
Cheese egg!

107
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,130

I, uh...

108
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,830
真希望我今天能去

109

We're putting the final details on the sale,

110
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,590
而且戈登有点  心碎了吧
and Gordon's a little... heartbroken, I think.

111
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,550
说真的  没关系的
Honestly, it's just fine.

112
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,310
本来也不是什么大事
It's such a non-thing.

113
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,320
我还是照常扮演听话的机器人
I'm gonna do my little obedient-robot routine,

114
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,780
然后就完事了
and that's it.

115
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,220
完事了你也来一趟吧
You should swing by after.

116
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,760
戈登会消气的
Gordon'll get over himself.

117
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,220
没事的  因为我还得去
It's fine anyways, 'cause I have to...

118
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,580
借过
excuse me.

119
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,940
问答会之后  我还得和雅达利谈谈
I'm having a sit-down with Atari after the panel deal

120
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,590
聊聊《朝圣者》下一步怎么走
to talk next steps on Pilgrim, so...

121
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,770
肯定会聊得很愉快吧
Oh, that should go smoothly.

122
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,040
是啊  我觉得他们会回心转意的
Yeah, I think they're gonna come around.

123
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,840
我  给你准备了个礼物
I, uh... I got a present for you.

124
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,580

Me?

125
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,930
打电游的时候用
For your video games.

126
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,950
这可真是
Well, that's...

00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,340
消极进攻啊
passive-aggressive.

128
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,860
真的  有吗
Really? Is it?

129
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,840
因为我本来是想玩直白
'Cause I was... I was aiming for blunt,

130
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,070
-坚决明确的  -那你没做好
- uncompromising clarity. - Oh. You missed the mark.

131
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,820

You're loud.

132
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,610
你不管干什么都那么大声
Everything you do is loud...

133
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,590
-还邋里邋遢  -抱歉
- and messy. - Sorry.

134
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,990
倒让我想起来了
Which reminds me,

135
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,420
你今天应该收拾行李了
you should unpack the boxes today.

136
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,410
我非常抱歉打乱了你
I'm so sorry for interrupting

完美分类归置的小生活了
your perfect catalogue existence little life.

138
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,800
我怎么感觉你把那当做是一种侮辱呢
I feel like you, um... you thought that was an insult.

139
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,400
-你是个怪人你知道吗  -收拾吧
- You're a freak. You know that, right? - Unpack.

140
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,850
你就好像有人给了霍华德·休斯
You're like if somebody gave Howard Hughes...

141
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,300
-赶紧开箱  -一本《流浪者之歌》
- Unpack..Our boxes...- A copy of "Siddhartha"

142
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,340
而他就那么接受了
and he just rolled with it.

143
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,500
你就差三瓶尿
You're like three bottles of piss away

144
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,820
就能建立一个完美的抗菌室
from building a perfect antibacterial chamber.

145
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,560
你瞧  隔音效果真好嘿
See? God, these work great.

146
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,580
你说的话我一个字都没听见
I can't hear a word you're saying.

147
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,730
烦死人了你
You're so annoying.

Your car will be here in 20.

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,690
放在你桌上了  不过
It's on your desk, but...

152
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,660
早上好
Good morning.

153
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,890
音威士的人今天送来的
the guys at TuneWorx sent this in today

154
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,040
作为成功上市募股的谢礼
as a thank-you for the IPO.

155
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,700
他们知道我玩吉他
They know I play.

156
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,450
我和望远镜的人谈过了
I talked to the guys at Spyglass.

157
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,480
他们不是不接受风投吗
I thought they weren't taking VC.

158
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,720
如果我没看错的话
If I'm reading it right,

159
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,220
他们要给马赛克的代码申请专利了
they're going to license the Mosaic code,

160
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,990
如果他们打算接受投资的话
and if they take anyone's money,

161
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,310
就该是来自我们
it should be ours.

162
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,210
几周前你还对浏览器不感兴趣呢
Few weeks ago, you weren't interested in a browser play.

163
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,100
你也知道
Yeah, well, you know,

164
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,940
好的浏览器总是很吸引人嘛
the right browser could have legs.

165
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,890
我学了好几年了
Been taking lessons a couple years now.

166
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,690
我弹得还行
I mean, I'm a good player.

167
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,590
但肯定够不上大师级
I'll never be a great player.

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,560
别这么说嘛
Don't say that.

169
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,640
望远镜那边有消息我会通知你的
I'll keep you in the loop on Spyglass.

170
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,900
我们可以联手
We could tag-team it.

171
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,750
多谢
Thanks.

172
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,950
是寄给卡梅伦的箱子
Package came for Cameron.

173
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,020
太好了
Great.

174
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,570
又来东西了
More stuff.

175
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,620
是汤姆寄来的
It's from Tom.

176
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,890
还有几份
Just a couple more.

177
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,750
你还好吧
You okay?

178
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,780
我们没办法
Our hands were tied.

179
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,110
而且卖价很高
We sold high.

180
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,310
比预计的要高一倍
Got twice what we thought we would.

181
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,300
看来你有动力的时候
Guess you can still navigate the business world

182
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,660
还是能叱咤生意场的
when you're motivated.

183
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,110
我们有资金  可以重新开始
We've got capital, blank canvas.

184
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,820
我喜欢这里
I liked this place.

185
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,730
我知道现在没这种感觉  但是
I know it doesn't feel like it now, but...

186
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,360
这是一个开始
this is the start of something.

187
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,950
11点的预约快到了
Our 11:00 will be here soon.

188
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,890
好啊
What's up?

189
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,820
乔想和你谈谈
Joe would like to talk to you about the pro--

190
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,830
你做的索引
The index you made,

191
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,850
那个指南  彗星网址单那个
the-the-the guide, the comet list thing.

192
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,290
我很喜欢
I love it.

193
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:39,780
谢谢
Thanks.

194
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,890
更重要的是  其他人也喜欢
More importantly, other people love it.

195
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,570
访问量惊人
The traffic is astonishing.

196
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,750
没错  宝贝  这主意真的很棒
Yeah, honey, it's a really, really good idea.

197
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,910
这个主意  做索引  显然是我的
The idea, obviously, was mine, the indexing.

198
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,950
我自己人工做了很多年
I did that work by hand over years.

199
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,170
你爸爸是想说
What your dad means to say

200
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,730
对这个想法的执行非常好
is that the execution of that idea is wonderful,

201
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,860
我们想从你手里买下它
and we want to buy it from you.

202
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,060
乔  慢点来
Oh, Joe, slow down.

203
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,760
-乔  -我想在它的基础上构建出一个
- Joe... - I want to build it and make it into something...

204
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,860
真正的产品  无意冒犯
real... no offense.

205
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,090
我会立即把它转移到专属的服务器上
I would migrate it to its own dedicated server immediately

206
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,720
这样就能进行无缝交接
so there is a seamless transition,

207
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,370
对服务也没有影响
no interruption in service.

208
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,730
我今天就能做
I would do that today.

209
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,770
我已经做了
I did it already.

210
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,650
你想买下它吗
You want to buy it?

211
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,660
他是...乔...
What he -- Joe's, uh...

212
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,010
这是你做出来的
Look, you...you did the work,

213
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,400
所以我们自然要从你手中收购
so it's only natural that we would buy it from you.

214
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,760
这...是规矩
That's...that's...that's how these things work.

215
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,100
行啊  用多少钱买
Okay. Buy it for how much?

216
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,030
-我们可以从  -我觉得两万元就挺合理
- We would begin... - I think a reasonable sum would be $20,000.

217
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,980
你能跟我出来谈一下吗
Can I talk to you real quick?

218
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,110
我以为你要给她
Look, I thought you were gonna offer her, like,

219
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,940
像是百视达的礼品卡
a-a gift certificate to Blockbuster

220
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,590
或者是一百块之类的
or, like, a hundred bucks or something.

221
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,240
你想给你的亲女儿压这样的低价
You want to low-ball your own daughter?

222
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,860
不是的  乔
No, Joe.

223
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,970
是你说"象征性给点"好吧  她只有14岁
You said a "nominal fee," Okay? She's 14 years old.

224
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,410
你不能给一个14岁孩子两万块
You can't give a 14-year-old $20,000.

225
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,030
这个网站
This website has...

226
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,890
-我在捏爆你的头  -两周有一万两千的访问量
- I'm crushing your head. - 12,000 unique visitors in two weeks.

227
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,210
这简直难以置信
That's unbelievable.

228
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,010
我不管
I don't give a shit.

229
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,520
她才14岁
She's 14 years old.

230
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,960
十年后她就24了
In 10 years, she'll be 24 years old,

231
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,520
而这个想法可能值数十亿
and this idea could be worth a billion dollars.

232
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,490
我们不能给她钱
We're not giving her the money.

233
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,410
我们可以想别的办法  像是信托基金什么的
Okay? We can come up with another idea or a trust fund or something,

234
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,530
-但我们不能给她  -这主意很好
- but we're not giving a her... - Yes, that sounds great.

235
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,530
行  我们往一个信托基金里投两万
Yeah, we'll put $20,000 in a trust fund.

236
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,070
我们谈了一下
We talked.

237
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,800
我们想给五千块...
And we think that $5,000 --

238
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,170
我不想要钱
I don't want money.

239
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,930
我想参与进来
I want to work on it.

240
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,150
-成交  -什么
- Deal. - What? Wh--

241
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,180
我想来这里参与它的工作
I want to be able to come here and work on it

242
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,870
以此顶一节课
instead of going to school for one period.

243
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,160
-我们可以...  -就当是我的自主学习
- Well, we could -- - It can be my independent study.

244
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,700
没问题  我们这就确定相关事宜
No problem. We'll wire that up right away.

245
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,730
我知道你现在得回去上语文课
Now, I understand you have to get back to English,

246
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,040
所以我们等你放学再谈
so we're gonna talk about this after school.

247
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,280
戈登  我们在你家见
Gordon, we'll meet at your place?

248
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,750
好吧
Sure.

249
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,410
他们的防火墙有宣传得那么好吗
Is their firewall as strong as it sounds?

250
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,110
应用层已更新到第三代了
Third-generation, application layer.

251
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,300
他们很有才
They're very talented.

252
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,800
展览也办得很成功
Put on a good show, too.

253
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,940
说到作秀...
Speaking of putting on a show...

254
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,060
瞧瞧他
Look at him.

255
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,330
虽然他很怪  但是个不错的合伙人
For all his quirks, it's good he's a partner.

256
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,340
他能带来生意
He brings in deals.

257
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,850
他企图在浏览器上打压我
He's trying to outflank me on the browser front.

258
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,690
几周前  他把千禧浏览器损得一无是处
Few weeks ago, he shits all over Millennium.

259
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,850
现在他又去讨好望远镜了
Now he's cozying up to Spyglass?

260
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,410
他没跟我提起什么
Well, he didn't mention anything to me.

261
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,260
或许他只是想和你好好合作
Maybe he just wants to work with you.

262
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,040
尼娜·克莱因来了
There's Nina Klein.

263
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,940
我要去打个招呼
I should go say hi.

264
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,180
去吧  我要...
You go ahead. I'm gonna...

265
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,970
乔·利伯曼可以滚边了
Well, uh, Joe Lieberman can blow me.

266
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,740
《毁灭战士》只是冰山一角  好吗
Doom is just the tip of the iceberg, okay?

267
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,530
这就是未来  就这样
That's the future, full stop.

268
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,410
不对  抱歉
No. Sorry.

269
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,550
恐怕我不能完全赞同你的观点
I'm not sure I totally agree.

270
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,380
我还没玩过《毁灭战士》
Look, I haven't played Doom,

271
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,940
并不是因为它很暴力
but it's not because it's so violent,

272
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,970
而是因为在我看来  它很无聊
because to me, it seems boring.

273
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,310
你在说笑吧  这游戏让人上瘾
You kidding me? It's addictive.

274
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,940
是  它是个斯金纳箱  很多游戏都是如此
Yeah, it's a Skinner box -- a lot of these games are.

275
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,940
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}斯金纳为研究操作性条件反射而设计的实验设备

276
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,030
就像老虎机  能不断吸引你继续玩
They're slot machines, so they'll keep you coming back,

277
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,920
但并不能给你满足感
but they're not gonna fulfill you in any way.

278
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,220
我要说的是
Look, all I'm saying is,

279
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,580
我觉得未来还有空间给那些
I think there's room in the future

280
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,300
血腥第一视角射击游戏之外的游戏
for more than just gory, first-person shooters.

281
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,610
又有人要提问了
I think we have another -- another question.

282
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,090
我有个问题要问卡梅伦
This question's for Cameron.

283
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,760
我想问你能不能谈一下你的新游戏《朝圣者》
I was wondering if you could talk about your new game, Pilgrim.

284
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,450
我看见它的发行日期改了
I saw the release date was changed.

285
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,070
是的  雅达利作为合作者一直
Yeah, Atari has been a really supportive partner

286
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,470
都很支持这个游戏
in collaborating on this game,

287
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,890
他们只是想再多花点时间
and they are just taking a bit of extra time

288
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,040
来想一个最佳策略
to figure out the best strategy.

289
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,670
但是  就快了
But, um, it's coming.

290
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,040
我对此感到很激动
I'm excited about it.

291
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,960
我想你也会的
I think you will be, too.

292
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,910
你能不能说一个大概的完成时间呢
Do you have, like, a ballpark time when it'll be done?

293
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,030
已经完成了
It's done now.

294
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,890
至于发行  得问雅达利了
In terms of release, that would be a question for Atari.

295
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,850
下载游戏的好处在于
Cool thing about games you download,

296
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,490
在发行方面  支出少了
in terms of release, there's less overhead,

297
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,580
那么干预就少  所以就更血腥
which means less interference, meaning more blood.

298
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,990
还有人要提问吗
Do we have any other questions --

299
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,530
没错
Yeah, I mean...

300
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,370
没错  能减少一个中间人
Yeah, anytime you can cut out a middle man,

301
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,600
总是好事  对吗
it's a good thing, right?

302
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,300
就像我说的  我和雅达利关系很好
Like I said, I have a great relationship with Atari,

303
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,450
我们彼此都非常尊重对方
a lot of mutual respect,

304
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,130
但在我的职业生涯中也遇到过
but there have been times in my career

305
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,740
我的选择不被尊重的情况
where my choices were not as respected.

306
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,690
好了
W-- Okay.

307
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,760
如果没有其它问题的话
If there aren't, uh, any more questions,

308
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,150
我们今天就到这里
I think that about does it for us.

309
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,680
感谢诸位的光临
thank you all for coming.

310
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,540
感谢我们的嘉宾  汤米和
thanks to our guests, Tommy and --

311
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,490
我有个问题想问豪伊女士
I have a question for Ms. Howe.

312
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,370
你好  唐娜
Hello, Donna.

313
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,900
你能否谈一下
I was hoping you could talk a bit about

314
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,360
你作为创作者
the relationship between a creator, such as yourself,

315
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,450
和游戏经营方的关系
and the business side of gaming.

316
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,830
你之前似乎提到了
You seemed to indicate earlier

317
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,750
你在这方面有一些困难
that there was some difficulty for you there,

318
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,200
我想请问
and I was wondering if you felt

319
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,290
你是否觉得自身有什么责任
you had any culpability in that.

320
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,270
这本身就是种纠结的关系
Well, it's inherently a fraught relationship, right?

321
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,490
怎么说
How so?

322
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,240
我们有能力
Well, in that we have the ability

323
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,120
从无到有地进行创造
to create something out of nothing,

324
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,440
而这可能威胁到经营方
and that can be threatening to people on the business side

325
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,350
因为  他们没有这个能力
because... they can't.

326
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,850
就我的经验而言
Well, in my experience --

327
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,010
当然  我不足以成为台上
and, granted, I'm not the one up there onstage

328
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,920
门罗互联网战略会议的一员
at the Menlo Internet Strategy Conference...

329
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,280
但以我的经验  经营方的人
...but in my experience, someone on the business side

330
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,530
能够对处于徘徊期或者方向不正确的项目
could help shepherd a project that's meandering or...

331
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,100
进行引导
headed off a cliff.

332
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,920
可以是一个好帮手  不是吗
Could be an ally, no?

333
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,350
所以其实应该是一种共生关系
Seems like that relationship should be symbiotic.

334
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,400
我觉得是寄生关系
I would say it's parasitic.

335
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,580
宿主的健康与否不重要
There's little regard for the wellbeing of the host

336
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,390
因为寄生虫总能撤走
because a parasite can always scuttle away,

337
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,040
去找下一个目标
on to the next warm body.

338
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,550
好的
Ok-Okay.

339
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,200
就到这里了  我们时间有限
I think that does it. We are, uh -- We're out of time.

340
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,610
感谢各位的光临
Thank you all for coming.

341
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,660
感谢大家的提问
Thank you for your questions,

342
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,980
希望有机会在外面见到大家
and I hope we get a chance to meet some of you outside.

343
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,080
是的  我要按月支付
Well, yes, I'm going to make the monthly.

344
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,710
每月就发这点工资
I-I'm at the mercy of the pay schedule here.

345
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,230
我只是个顾问
It's a consultant position.

346
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,200
-怎么样  -不错
- How was -- - Fine. It was fine.

347
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,650
-是的  -有什么进展
- Yes. - Do we have an update?

348
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,360
算法在持续抓取新网页
The algorithm is continuing to pick up new pages.

349
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,760
正在有效地记录网络
It's effectively charting the web.

350
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,360
好的
Okay.

351
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,540
我们只能搜索网址和网页标题  但是
We're only searching URLs and page headings but --

352
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,420
为什么不能搜索网页内容
Why can't we search the body of the page?

353
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,050
这当然是最终的目标
That's the ultimate goal, of course.

354
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,080
-但我们还没达到那一步  -数据量太大了
- We're just not quite there yet. - It's too much data.

355
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,170
以现有的带宽
W-With -- With current bandwidth,

356
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,940
会让一切陷入停滞
everything just grinds to a halt.

357
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,660
我们的标题搜索效率如何
How effectively can we search titles?

358
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,860
效率很高
Very effectively,

359
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,050
但是标题不总是
but the title doesn't always correspond

360
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,250
和网页内容相符
with, um, what's on the site,

361
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,080
所以搜索结果
so the results are...

362
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,090
你一直在笑嘻嘻地告诉我坏消息
You keep giving me bad news with a smile on your face.

363
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,820
你自己知道吗
Do you know that you're doing that?

364
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,840
你们有全力投入吧
You guys are invested in this, right?

365
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,180
他们在熬夜做
Well, they have been up all night working on it.

366
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,310
那你们有什么成果值得展示
And what do you have to show for it?

367
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,510
搜索下"总统"
Let's search "president".

368
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,580
没有克林顿
No Clinton.

369
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,640
我看到的只有包含总统这个单词的结果
What I see are generic president results.

370
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,690
估计在这堆结果下面
My guess is that somewhere buried among them

371
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,220
是关于现任自由世界领袖的条目
are results about the current leader of the free world,

372
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,160
我想人们输入"总统"时
which is what I assume people are looking for

373
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,080
应该就是想找那个
when they type in "president."

374
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,750
我们需要一个复杂的规则引擎
What we need is a sophisticated rules engine in place.

375
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,370
而现在完全没有
What I see is no rules engine at all.

376
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,540
你们知道我以前是个工程师吧
You do know I used to be an engineer, right?

377
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,840
他们并不知道该做什么
They don't know what's expected of them

378
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,980
除非你们告诉他们
unless you tell them.

379
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,450
我指望你们让他们明白
I am counting on you to make it clear

380
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,430
他们有多短的时间把这个做好
just how little time they have to get this right.

381
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,880
好吗
Okay?

382
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,240
好了
Okay.

383
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,310
嗯  好
Oh, yeah. Cool.

384
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,720
好  调出来  我们看看
Okay. Pull it up, let's take a look.

385
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,480
我改了名字
I changed the header.

386
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,490
嗯  我喜欢  彗星
Oh, yeah. I like that. It's Comet.

387
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,950
听上去像呕吐
It sounds like vomit.

388
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,010
别听她的
Don't listen to her.

389
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,530
能表达出一种速度感  一种奇妙感
It conveys speed, a sense of wonder.

390
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,890
-这是什么  -乔和海莉
- What is this? - It's -- Joe and Haley

391
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,080
在做海莉的网站项目
are working on Haley's website project.

392
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,440
用来代替我的自主学习学分
It's replacing my independent-study credit.

393
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,230
什么  她可以为此不去上学吗
What? She gets to miss school for this?

394
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,230
我也想不上学
I want to miss school.

395
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,260
你是不上学
You do miss school,

396
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,930
但你不跟人说
you just don't tell anyone about it.

397
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,530
呵呵
Hardy-har-har.

398
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,190
我觉得  我们可以
You know, I think it would be helpful

399
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,120
最先设定一些分类
if, like, we started out with a bunch of categories,

400
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,120
-然后  -我们不能让它显得枯燥
- and then... - But we don't want to make it seem dry, you know?

401
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,800
不能让人觉得
We don't want to make it feel like

402
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,490
这是谁都能整理出来的
anyone could have organized this.

403
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,160
是啊  这点子太蠢了
Right. Yeah, it's a dumb idea.

404
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,110
不不  你所做的的优秀之处
No, no, what's so great about what you've done

405
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,470
在于其亲力亲为的感觉
is its personal touch,

406
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,280
感觉好像有人在另一端
the feeling that there is a person on the other side,

407
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,440
为你制造这一体验
creating this experience for you.

408
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,140
妈妈知道吗
Mom know about this?

409
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,930
不  她还不知道
No, she does not yet,

410
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,180
但我会来把这事告诉她
but I will be the one to give her that information,

411
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,060
谢谢了
thank you very much.

412
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,710
我能看吗
Can I watch?

413
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,350
我们要不要
Why don't we go, uh,

414
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,340
去纽约州北做洞穴探险
caving in upstate New York, you know, spelunking?

415
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,440
你在说胡话呢
You're literally shouting nonsense.

416
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,820
我有一堆资料
I got all this stuff, you know,

417
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,570
现在又有时间了
and -- and I've got time now.

418
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,500
我们该去冒险
We should go on an adventure.

419
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,480
我不想去山洞
I don't want to go to a cave.

420
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,860
那海莉呢
Well, look, Haley...

421
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,430
洞穴探险
...spelunking?

422
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,850
记得你做的那个关于钟乳石的项目吗
You remember that project you did about stalactites?

423
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,960
你想做什么我都行  爸爸
I'm cool wit whatever you want, Dad.

424
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,610
那件T恤衫  好酷
Oh, that T-shirt. That's wild,

425
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,830
我来的路上还在听仪式乐队
I was listening to Ritual on the way over here.

426
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,490
别费劲了
Please don't try.

427
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,530
去杰克逊霍尔飞钓呢
Wh-What about fly-fishing in Jackson Hole?

428
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,150
有人刚给我发了新链接加入我们的索引
Someone just sent me a new link to put in our index.

429
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,470
是...色青屋
It's, um, Smuth-ut.

430
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,660
琼妮  我们其实需要你的意见
You know, Joanie, we could actually use your input here.

431
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,110
什么样的网站会让你觉得很酷
What would make a website seem, you know, cool to you?

432
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,390
我觉得酷的是
Well, I think it's pretty cool

433
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,020
"美国最搞笑家庭视频"里
on "America's Funniest Home Videos"

434
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,920
有人被袭蛋
when guys get hit in the nuts.

435
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,660
好主意
That's a great idea.

436
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,230
好像是个建筑方面的
It's like some kind of construction thing.

437
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,770
我们该做这个  阿帕拉契山径
We should do this. The Appalachian Trail!

438
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,440
明年夏天
Next summer.

439
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,740
我们可以去徒步缅因州百里荒野
We can do the hundred-mile wilderness of Maine!

440
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,750
-糟糕  -天呐
- Oh, n-- - Oh, my God.

441
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,100
-快关掉  -抱歉  我在关
- Take down that... - Sorry. I'm taking it down!

442
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,530
关掉  关掉
Turn it off! Shut it down. Shut it --

443
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,920
-真棒  -对不起
- Yeah! - I'm sorry.

444
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,390
-关掉  -还有个脑袋
- Turn it off. - Oh, there's another head!

445
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,680
关掉
Take it off!

446
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,840
-还有个脑袋  -遮住眼睛
- There's another head. - Hide your eyes.

447
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,380
-我没在看  -她太娇贵了
- I'm not looking! - She's too precious, you guys.

448
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,880
放开我
Get off of me!

449
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,050
天呐
God.

450
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,220
听着  这太不体面了
Okay, look, that is inappropriate.

451
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,570
嗯
Yeah.

452
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,450
好
Yes, uh...

453
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,710
嗯  我们下周坐下谈谈吧
Yeah, let's sit down next week and talk about it.

454
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,320
我会让谭雅
I'll have Tanya

455
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,470
艾什莉打电话告诉你时间
or -- um, Ashley give you a call with times.

456
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,670
好的  你也是  再见
Okay. You, too. Bye.

457
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:02,700
你刚刚在跟摇滚小子说什么呢
What were you and, uh, Richie Sambora talking about?

458
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,890
他的暑期计划
His summer vacation plans.

459
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,020
那肯定很好玩吧
Oh, well, that must have been riveting.

460
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,890
别再说崔普了
Stop talking about Trip.

461
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,020
我不想再说他了
I don't want to talk about Trip anymore.

462
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,710
好吧
Okay.

463
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,530
他是个人才  还是公司的合伙人  唐娜
He is an asset and a partner in this firm, Donna.

464
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,410
这我知道
Yeah, I understand that.

465
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,180
我想我只是想确保
I guess I was just trying to make sure

466
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,920
会有人支持我
that someone had my back.

467
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,740
你知道这办公室是个男生俱乐部
You know this office is a boys' club.

468
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,070
的确
It is a boys' club,

469
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,850
而我还是在没人帮助的情况下当上了执行合伙人
and I made managing partner without anyone holding my hand.

470
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,080
他有优势吗  当然
Does he have an advantage? Of course he does.

471
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,850
但那跟你无关
But that has nothing to do with you.

472
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,890
你在这里的成功是基于结果的
Your success here is based on results,

473
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,450
我觉得你把团队打得鼻青脸肿
and I don't think you kicking the crap out of your team

474
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,030
是得不到结果的
is the way to get 'em.

475
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,340
我是来告诉你
I came in here to tell you

476
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,820
你流浪者团队里那个女生
that your girl from the Rover team --

477
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,050
她刚刚在楼梯井里哭呢
she was crying in the stairwell just now.

478
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,080
你或许该考虑采取温柔点的手段
You might want to consider a lighter touch.

479
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,430
-好吧  我们开始吧  -好
- Okay. Here we go... - Okay.

480
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,450
-那个  -听着  我明白你们说策略的事
- So - Listen, I heard what you said about strategy,

481
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,970
-我  -抱歉  容我...
- and I-- - I'm sorry, let me --

482
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,290
我们最好先说
I think we should go first here.

483
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,060
很不幸  我们不知道怎么会出现这种情况
Unfortunately, we don't know how this happened,

484
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,990
但《电子游戏月刊》
but someone at Electronic Gaming Monthly

485
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,750
拿到了《朝圣者》
got a hold of Pilgrim.

486
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,100
开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

487
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,560
今天出来了一篇评论
A review came out today,

488
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,740
我们拿到了预售本
and we got our hands on an advanced copy.

489
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,330
怎么样
How is it?

490
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,970
老实说  不好
It wasn't good, to be honest.

491
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,820
我们都支持这款游戏
We were all rooting for this game,

492
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,870
你也知道我们多么
and you know how fond we are

493
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,140
喜欢你和你的一切作品
of you and all the work that you've done.

494
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,330
你们打算不发了吗
Are you just gonna sit on it?

495
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,100
以现在的样子发布
Releasing it in its current form

496
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,940
就目前而言不是可行策略
isn't a viable strategy at this point.

497
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,100
太疯狂了
That's crazy.

498
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,640
评论怎么说的
What did it say?

499
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:58,860
你自己看吧
I'll let you read it.

500
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,310
我保证
I promise,

501
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,850
我们的律师会去找评论人
our lawyers are gonna get into it with the reviewer,

502
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,660
不管是谁把游戏给了他  也会承担责任
and whoever gave him the game will be dealt with.

503
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,260
是我给他们的
I gave it to them.

504
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,390
我想修饰一下界面
I want to spruce up the interface --

505
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:42,090
不用太花哨  应该利落高效
not too slick, but it should be, like, clean and efficient.

506
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,460
而且我们该在各大留言板上推广一下
And we should spread awareness on the message boards.

507
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,750
还有平面广告  今后值得考虑一下
Print ads, too, might be worth a look down the road.

508
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,980
你对这个似乎真的很热衷
You seem really excited about this.

509
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,790
你该实现它
I mean, you should run with it.

510
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,020
当然了  我下定决心了
Absolutely. I'm committed to this.

511
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:59,660
不  我是说  你该接过去
No, I mean, uh, you should take it.

512
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,870
给海莉开张支票  然后接过去
Write Haley a check and -- and take it.

513
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,250
是因为色情屋的事吗
Is this about Smut Hut?

514
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,640
我会把我的电邮写成网站联络方式
I'll make my e-mail the contact for the site.

515
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,190
不不  不是那个
No, no. It's -- It's not.

516
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,530
就是
It's just, uh...

517
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,600
原因很多
it's a lot of things, okay?

518
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,640
我不确定我希望她做这个
I'm not sure that I want this for her.

519
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,970
好吧
Okay.

520
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,470
戈登
You know, Gordon...

521
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,810
我希望我们一起做的
...I want us to do this together.

522
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,300
你跟我一样
You can't sit still

523
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,820
-是个坐不住的人  -乔  我没闲坐着
- any more than I can. You know? - Joe, I haven't been sitting still.

524
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,800
我一直都忙里忙外地
I've been busting my ass, working on things,

525
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,860
经营着我在意的东西
things that I care about,

526
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,200
而且告诉你
and just to let you know,

527
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,380
我都没要你帮忙
I have been doing it without your help.

528
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,900
对此我很抱歉
And I'm sorry about that.

529
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,510
这是个大转变
It's a big shift,

530
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,700
而且
you know, and --

531
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,520
发生得很快
and it happened fast and --

532
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,490
你什么都没变  乔
Nothing's shifted for you, Joe.

533
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,590
你的眼睛一直盯着这个
You've had your eyes locked on this,

534
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,420
盯着网络
on the web, the whole time.

535
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,820
你逼迫人  乔
You push people, Joe.

536
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,440
在卡迪夫
You did it at Cardiff.

537
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,580
西方集团
You did it at WestGroup.

538
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,130
你一直都这么做
You do it all the time.

539
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,450
你决定了什么对一个公司或一个人好
You decide what's right for a company or a person

540
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,830
然后就不顾他们准没准备好  一个劲地逼迫他们
and you push them whether they're ready for it or not,

541
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,170
我现在就告诉你
and I can tell you right now,

542
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,660
海莉还没准备好
Haley's not ready for it.

543
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,250
该死
Oh, shit.

544
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,110
我该走了
I should go.

545
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,760
你不用破费的
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

546
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:39,930
崔普叫我把这个拿给你
Trip asked me to bring this to you.

547
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,960
邮包炸弹吗
Letter bomb?

548
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,480
我去把这个放进冰箱里
I'm gonna put this in the fridge.

549
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,910
需要我做什么吗
Do you need me to do anything?

550
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,020
不用
No, just...

551
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,900
给自己倒点东西吧
pour yourself something.

552
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,890
敲敲门
Knock, knock.

553
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,370
博斯  谢谢你来
Bos, thanks for coming.

554
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,080
当然了  这肯定好玩
Well, sure, it should be fun.

555
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,570
我觉得过意不去
I just felt bad.

556
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,730
我...一早上很不顺
I was such a -- I had a crappy morning.

557
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,920
我觉得...
I figured...

558
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,290
稍稍放松下能有利于鼓舞士气
a little unwinding would be good for morale.

559
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,930
没事  我懂的
No, look, I get it.

560
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,820
但那些孩子要被晃出毛病了
The kids are gonna get whiplash, though,

561
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,050
你前一刻对他们凶巴巴的
well, you laying 'em out one minute

562
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,050
接下来又请他们来吃晚饭
and invitin' them to dinner the next.

563
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,160
但是
But...

564
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,120
你知道如果流浪者有什么问题
You know you can always come directly to me

565
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,890
你总可以直接来找我的吧
if there's ever any trouble with Rover, right?

566
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,490
-什么问题  -有人吗
- Trouble? - Hello!

567
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,670
他们来了
There they are!

568
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,940
进来吧
Come on in!

569
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:51,270
你们  自己找点喝的吧
You can, uh, grab yourself something to drink,

570
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,090
还有...过来抱一个
and there's -- Oh, come here.

571
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,260
披萨就来了
Pizza's on the way.

572
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,110
-这房子真好  -看啊
- It's a really nice home. - Look at that.

573
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,060
-解百纳  威士忌  -不了  谢谢
- Cab? Scotch? - No, thank you.

574
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,990
"呆板  混乱"
"A ponderous mess."

575
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,440
"豪伊完全出于自大
"It's Howe's ego-encasing strategy

576
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,870
让人们根本无从理解游戏
to put any understanding of the game completely out of reach,

577
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:27,200
而当用户无法领悟  又责怪他们
and then blame the user when they are unable to grasp it.

578
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,090
我向读者们保证  你们没错过什么
Let me assure my readers, you are not missing anything,

579
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:33,610
这款游戏根本不好玩"
for this game simply isn't any fun."

580
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,250
你为什么要发给他们
Why did you send it to 'em?

581
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,010
我以为它很好
I thought it was good.

582
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,330
这只是一个评论
It's just one review.

583
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,930
不是的  这是唯一的评论  这是...
It's not. It's the review. It's --

584
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,390
天呐  焦点小组  测试
God, the focus-group testing --

585
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,800
你都不喜欢
even you didn't like it.

586
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,210
我还没打完呢
I haven't finished it yet.

587
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,320
他们怎么说的  怎么打算的
What did they say, what -- what -- what's...

588
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,280
他们要拿走游戏  拿走代码
They're gonna take the game, take the code,

589
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,690
给别人  重新编排
give it to some guy, retool it,

590
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:12,130
我不知道  可能改成大胸雇佣兵
add -- I don't know -- probably a big-titted mercenary

591
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,110
砍人的头吧
decapitating people or something.

592
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,750
看着我
Look at me.

593
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,530
你有一堆的点子
You are full of ideas,

594
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,810
你会制作很多受人喜爱的游戏
and you are going to make a lot of games that people love.

595
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,330
你得把这事放下
You need to put this behind you,

596
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,420
重新开始  向前看
start fresh, and move on.

597
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,380
这对我没那么简单
It's not that easy for me.

598
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,180
我得去  喘口气
I need to, uh, take a breather,

599
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,990
自己待会儿  好吗
just be by myself for a sec, okay?

600
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:21,080
我著名的沙拉来了
Well, here comes my famous salad.

601
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,340
里面有糖核桃  秘诀在这里
There's candied walnuts in it. That's the secret.

602
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,710
我不会说出去
Well, it's safe with me.

603
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,260
小猴子
Monkey.

604
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,440
一切都好吗
Everything okay?

605
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,260
不好  爸爸好浑
No. Dad's being a dick.

606
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,710
我今晚能待这儿吗
Can I stay here tonight?

607
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,120
当然
Yeah, sure.

608
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,510
琼妮  这是大家  各位  这是琼妮
Joanie, this is everyone. Everyone, Joanie.

609
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,420
你想来点披萨吗
Do you want some pizza?

610
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,270
她做了她著名的沙拉
She made her famous salad.

611
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,300
她那么说了吗  她"著名的沙拉"
Did she call it her "famous salad"?

612
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,480
今天在公司  我找到了个网站
At work today, I found a website --

613
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,250
各位  我们不用谈工作的
Guys, we don't have to talk about work.

614
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,940
这就是消遣  你们不是在工作
This is fun. You're not on the clock.

615
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,150
要是不说工作
Well, if we're not gonna talk about work,

616
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,570
那我们说什么
what we gonna talk about?

617
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,880
好吧  好  抱歉
Okay. All right. I'm sorry.

618
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,950
我有事想说
Well, I have an update.

619
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,520
我们之前的问题
The problem we were having,

620
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,100
总统的问题
the -- the president problem...

621
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,780
西塞尔有办法解决了
...Cecil came up with a fix.

622
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,130
临时的解决办法
A -- A temporary solution.

623
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,540
维拉实施了基本推理法则
Vera implemented basic inference rules

624
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,920
补充了布林逻辑
that complement the Boolean logic,

625
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,720
这样当你输入"总统"即使没打"克林顿"
so when you type "president" without "Clinton,"

626
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,330
也能得到相关结果
you get relevant results.

627
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,250
"岩石/摇滚"会得到攀岩和音乐
"Rock" will give you climbing and music,

628
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,980
"鸡"能得到帕尔玛干酪
"Chicken" will give you Parmesan.

629
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,770
这是个创可贴  但暂时可用
It's a Band-Aid, but it works for now.

630
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:36,270
那如果我们输入"餐桌对话"呢
Well, what if we typed in "dinner-table conversation"?

631
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,730
好吧
Okay.

632
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,920
好吧
Okay.

633
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,440
好吧  我本不想这么做的
All right, I didn't want to have to do this,

634
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,950
但显然  没办法了
but apparently, I do.

635
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,770
小心  小心
Look out. Look out.

636
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,200
重武器来了
Here come the big guns.

637
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,240
我去
Oh, shit.

638
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:04,370
但我们必须放松下来
But we are going to relax.

639
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,340
我们要好好开心
We are gonna have fun.

640
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,020
我们都要忘记
We are all going to forget about

641
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,390
我今早多混蛋
what a jerk I was this morning.

642
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,910
-我能来一杯吗  -拉倒吧
- Can I have one? - Oh, yeah, right.

643
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,620
我不用了  谢谢
I'm okay, thanks.

644
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,880
不行  这是强制的
No. Unh-unh. This is mandatory.

645
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,080
除非你怀孕了
Unless you're pregnant,

646
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,010
我不想再听你说什么了
I don't want to hear another word about it.

647
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,790
天呐
Oh, my -- Oh, my God.

648
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,800
-真抱歉  -没事的
- I'm -- I'm so sorry. - No. It's okay.

649
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,780
真厉害  妈妈
Nice one, Mom.

650
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,230
那么...
Well, I guess...

651
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,700
我们有孩子了
We're pregnant.

652
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,120
什么
What?

653
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,570
恭喜  老天爷啊
Well, congratulations, for God's sake.

654
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,290
-谢谢  -干杯
- Thank you. - Salud!

655
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,360
天呐  我太过分了
Oh, my God. That was so rude.

656
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,310
真的没事
It's completely okay, please.

657
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,090
好吧  那至少允许我祝一杯酒
Okay, well, let me at least propose a toast, then,

658
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:03,330
我刚刚太过分了  侵犯了你们的隐私
after that horrible, invasive, horribleness.

659
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:11,130
我记得我怀着那家伙的时候
I remember when I was pregnant with that one --

660
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,400
她最喜欢我提这个了
she loves it when I do this --

661
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:18,300
我当时在睿侠工作  好能打折买零件
I was working at Radio Shack so I could get a discount on parts,

662
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,280
琼妮的爸爸和我当时在搭建第一台电脑
Joanie's dad and I were building our first computer,

663
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:25,220
我特别害怕被老板发现
and I was terrified that my boss would find out.

664
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,660
于是我去了二手店
So I went to a thrift store

665
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,790
买来了我能找到的最大最臃肿的毛衣
and I bought just the biggest, baggiest sweaters I could find.

666
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,790
总之  几个月后
Anyway, months go by,

667
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:36,450
我以为我完全唬住了那人
and I think I've got this guy completely fooled,

668
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:41,040
然后有一天  他非常随意地靠过来
and then one day, he leans over to me very casually,

669
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,010
他说
and he says,

670
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,370
"转眼间  他们就会长大
"Before you know it, they'll be grown.

671
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,740
你要抓住每个机会吻那个宝宝"
You kiss that baby every chance you get."

672
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,840
他是对的
Well, he was right.

673
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,420
总之
Anyway,

674
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:11,390
你不用在我身边穿大号衣服
you don't have to wear any giant sweaters around me...

675
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:13,890
但是
...but...

676
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,940
你们要抓住每个机会吻那个宝宝
You kiss that baby every chance you get.

677
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,270
我真为你们高兴
I'm so happy for you.

678
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,090
干杯
Cheers.

679
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,460
干杯
Cheers.

680
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,320
敬吻宝宝
Here's to baby-smooching, then.

681
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,970
-敬吻宝宝  -好啊
- To baby-smooching. - Sure!

682
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,180
-干杯  -干杯
- Cheers. - Salud.

683
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,330
干杯
Cheers.

684
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,530
你在这儿啊  你个小混蛋
There you are, you little shit.

685
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:14,270
抱歉  我只是需要个地方玩
Sorry, I just needed someplace to play.

686
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,460
我这就走
I'll get out of your hair.

687
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,170
你在玩《毁灭战士》
You playing Doom?

688
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,060
嗯
Yeah.

689
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:25,190
看来这是未来的趋势了
Yeah, I guess this is where everything's going.

690
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,500
杀光一切
You just... kill everything.

691
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,980
挺赞的  是吧
It's pretty awesome, right?

692
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,870
嗯
Yeah.

693
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,800
你玩过吗
You've played?

694
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,920
嗯  还打得挺好
Yeah. Pretty good at it, too.

695
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,430
一战到死
Deathmatch?

696
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,180
天呐
God!

697
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,780
戈登  快动
Gordon, move!

698
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,860
你知道游戏的目标是不死吧
You do know the object of the game is to not die, right?

699
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,530
你个混蛋
You bastard!

700
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,830
那个  我
So, I, um...

701
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,700
很遗憾你离婚了
I'm sorry about the divorce.

702
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,620
嗯  谢谢
Yeah. Thank you.

703
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,210
这是有种宣泄感
There is something cathartic about it.

704
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,700
当然了
You bet your ass.

705
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,300
你终归离婚了啊
It's that you get to be divorced afterwards.

706
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,180
我是指游戏
I was talking about the game.

707
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,140
是啊  嗯
Yeah, yeah.

708
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,420
你感觉怎么样
So, how you dealing with all of it?

709
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,180
挺好
Good.

710
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:47,970
对于我和唐娜
You know, for me and Donna, it was, uh...

711
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,470
最后的那几个月
you know, those last few months,

712
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:54,640
程序  解开一切的羁绊
the process and just getting everything untangled.

713
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,320
-那  -天呐
- It was... - Oh, my God.

714
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,570
很艰难的
It was really hard.

715
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,830
嗯  我能想象  还有孩子
Yeah, I can imagine, with kids.

716
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,580
对于我和汤姆  这...
For Tom and I, it's been, you know,

717
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:09,400
已经是最好的情况了吧  但还是...
as good as it can be, I guess, but still, it's...

718
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,960
这提醒我了  你收到了个包裹
That reminds me, um, you got a package out there.

719
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,160
乔忘记带走了
Joe forgot to take it with him.

720
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,050
我...好吧
I -- Okay.

721
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,550
我走时带着
I'll take it on my way out.

722
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,900
乔怎么样了
So, how's Joe?

723
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,250
挺好
Good.

724
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,060
谁知道呢  但是现在
I mean, you know, who knows, but right now...

725
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,890
挺好
good.

726
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,570
你们还会再合作吗
Think you guys'll ever work together again?

727
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,750
不会
No.

728
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,230
那是雷区
That's a minefield.

729
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,770
他对彗星的事非常激动
He, uh, is really pumped about this Comet thing, though.

730
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,680
他给我看了  真的很酷
He showed me. It's really cool.

731
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,300
我真不敢相信小海莉...
I just can't believe little Haley is --

732
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,190
嗯  我叫他自己继续了
Yeah, I told him to move on without us.

733
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:50,980
为什么
Why?

734
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,510
我不知道
I don't know, I...

735
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:56,530
琼妮说是因为我嫉妒
Joanie says it's 'cause I'm jealous.

736
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,490
她说对了吗
Is she right?

737
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,320
或许吧
Maybe.

738
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,710
或许我是嫉妒他们有个新点子
Maybe I'm just jealous that they had a new idea.

739
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,250
我绝对嫉妒
I mean, I'm definitely jealous

740
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,940
我已经不年轻了
that I'm not a kid anymore.

741
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:12,970
那么长久以来  一直担心
You know, all that time you spend worrying about

742
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,910
把精力浪费在错误的项目
wasting it on the wrong project,

743
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:18,310
或错误的人上
or the -- you know, the wrong person.

744
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,700
很难想到比跟她一起做一件
It's hard to think of a better way to spend your time

745
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,430
她在乎的事更值得做的事
than working with her on something she cares about.

746
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:33,420
真希望我爸爸能看到我有一技之长
I wish my dad could have seen me be good at something.

747
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,600
听着  你十几岁的女儿想跟你共处
Look, your teenage daughter wants to hang out with you.

748
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,200
这可不是常有的事
That doesn't happen.

749
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,920
我知道  但是
Yeah, I know, but...

750
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,420
你不用担心她变成我这样
You don't have to worry about her turning out like me.

751
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:55,110
她有两位很棒的家长照顾着她
She has two awesome parents looking out for her.

752
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,460
你还有个杯子做证明
You've even got a mug to prove it.

753
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,600
卡梅伦
Cameron!

754
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,870
-盒子  -抱歉
- Box. - Sorry.

755
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,090
谢谢
Thank you.

756
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,070
卡梅
Hey, Cam?

757
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,220
嗯
Yeah?

758
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,650
要是我的女儿变得像你也不会很糟的
It wouldn't be so bad if my girls turned out like you.

759
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,840
如果真是那样  我会为她们骄傲的
I'd be proud of 'em if they did,

760
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,440
作为父亲
you know, as a dad.

761
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,260
老天爷啊
Geez, Louise.

762
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,870
海莉做的东西挺酷  是吧
Haley's project's pretty cool, right?

763
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,540
非常酷
It's very cool.

764
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,300
嗯
Yeah.

765
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:08,680
该死
Oh, shit!

766
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,170
不要
No!

767
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,360
不要
No!

768
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,140
不要
No!

769
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,770
怎么了
What's going on?

770
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,110
我能进来吗
Can I come in?

771
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,660
嗯
Yeah.

772
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,760
你想跟乔一起做彗星吗
Do you want to work on Comet with Joe?

773
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,900
嗯
Yeah.

774
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,890
那有些条件
Then there are conditions.

775
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,320
一  别让他
One, you don't let him

776
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,700
或其他人欺负你
or anyone else push you around.

777
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:25,450
你要是有什么点子  就说出来
Okay, if you have an idea, you say so.

778
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:28,340
如果你不喜欢一个点子  也要说出来
If you don't like an idea, you say so, okay?

779
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:33,510
二  这是一种乐趣
Number two, this is fun, okay?

780
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,900
如果它不再有乐趣了
And the second that it stops being fun,

781
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,410
你告诉我  我们都离开
you say so, and we both walk away.

782
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,390
好
Okay.

783
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,840
-保证吗  -保证
- Promise? - Promise.

784
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,510
发誓
Cross your heart, hope to die?

785
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,560
嗯  发誓
Yeah, all that stuff.

786
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,190
那好
Okay.

787
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,750
你去哪
Where are you going?

788
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,390
我们该开始了
We should get started.

789
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,900
亲爱的  现在是半夜
Sweetheart, it's midnight.

790
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,830
我们还有工作要做呢
Well, we have work to do.

791
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,580
好吧
Okay.

792
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,750
那好
All right.

793
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:08,110
你关于分类的想法
Your idea about categorizing...

794
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,550
挺聪明的
...it's smart.

795
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,250
从那里开始吧
So... let's start there.

796
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,370
好
Okay.

797
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,020
大家简直对他们服服帖帖
They had the crowd eating out of their hand.

798
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,520
黛安也在的
I mean, Diane was there.

799
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,530
-他们很圆滑  -流浪者呢
- They're slick. - And Rover?

800
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,860
我昨晚请了全队去我家
I had the whole team over last night

801
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,160
我们好开诚布公
so we could open up the lines of communication,

802
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,080
聊聊工作之外的事
bat stuff around outside the office,

803
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,250
非常顺利
went really well.

804
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,840
那个网站的目标是什么
What's the endgame with that site?

805
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,610
怎么说
In what sense?

806
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,340
成品
The finished product --

807
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,510
我就是好奇你的设想是什么
I'm just curious how you're seeing that.

808
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,470
是你每次上网登录的第一个网站
It's the first site you visit every time you're online.

809
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,980
是能带你去你想去的地方的页面
It's the page that gets you where you wanna go --

810
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,320
抱歉  有什么问题吗
I'm sorry, is there a problem?

811
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,260
抱歉  我就是想让你注意一件事
No, sorry, I just wanted to flag something for you,

812
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,130
但我们可以稍后绕回来
but we can circle back to that later.

813
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,030
我去你办公室说
I'll swing by your office.

814
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:56,690
没事  如果你有事要说  就请说吧
Oh, no. If you have something to share, be my guest.

815
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,560
班基给我发了一个网站链接
Benji sent me a link to a site

816
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,810
感觉可能是个类似的理念
that feels like it might be operating in a similar space.

817
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:08,370
只想确保你知道
Just wanted to make sure you were aware.

818
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,190
班基  帮帮忙  去查查彗星是谁的
Benji, do me a favor and see who's behind Comet.

819
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,130
或许可以想想办法
Maybe there's a play to be made there.

820
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,440
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

821
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,050
不  我来吧
Oh, no. I can get that.

822
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,610
其实  有件事
I actually had one thing

823
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,390
我想跟你说两句
I wanted to talk to you about real quick.

824
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,540
好啊
Oh, good.

825
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,490
我也有事  但你先说吧
Me, too, but you go first.

826
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:35,120
单位有人给我看了彗星网  还是什么的
Someone at work showed me the comet list or Comet?

827
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,570
嗯  你觉得如何
Yeah. Yeah. What do you think?

828
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,210
-不错  -是吗
- It's good. - Yeah?

829
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,440
很不错  就是
It's really good, I just --

830
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,910
我们有个项目  看上去
we have something, a play that looks like

831
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:47,180
会跟这个形成竞争
it could be part of the competitive landscape,

832
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,020
我想告诉你一声
and I wanted to make sure you knew.

833
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,490
跟这个形成竞争
Part of the competitive landscape?

834
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,010
是一个搜索算法
It's a search algorithm,

835
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:57,180
基本上索引了网络  让它可搜索
basically indexing the web, making it searchable.

836
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:00,000
起初是个医疗索引软件
It started as a medical indexing software,

837
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,630
他们改用在了网络上
and they shifted into web.

838
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,500
是他们吗
They shifted.

839
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,810
什么时候
When?

840
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,420
不久之前
A little while ago.

841
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:10,270
这是团队的点子
Look, it's the idea the team came to.

842
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,120
出于好意  我想告诉你
I wanted to tell you as a courtesy.

843
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,190
那我第一次提到我们的索引项目时
Well, why didn't you tell me as a courtesy

844
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:16,810
你怎么没好意把这告诉我
when I mentioned our indexing project the first time?

845
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:19,730
你当时告诉我的是乔在写网址
Well, you told me that Joe was writing down websites.

846
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,160
你没说你们要以此建立公司
You didn't tell me you were building a company out of it.

847
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,570
你要跟我们竞争
So you're competing with us?

848
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:25,490
我们不非得的
Well, we don't have to be.

849
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:28,370
我相信我能劝说合伙人们收购你们
I'm sure I can talk the partners into buying you out.

850
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,670
收购我们
Buy us?

851
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,620
我们怎么不收购你们
Why don't we buy you?

852
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,880
戈登  你跟我们争不过
Oh, well, Gordon, you can't compete with us.

853
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,420
你们的资本没有我们雄厚
You're not capitalized the way we are.

854
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,710
你们打不了持久战的  相信我
You don't have the staying power, believe me.

855
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,310
是海莉的网站
It's Haley's website.

856
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:43,610
等等  什么
Wait. What?

857
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:46,810
海莉的彗星  这是她做的
Haley's Comet -- she made the thing.

858
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:48,200
我们要一起建造
We're building it together.

859
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:52,650
你打算什么时候告诉我的
When were you gonna tell me this?

860
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,690
-现在  -吃第二道甜点时吗
- Right now. - Oh, over second dessert?

861
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,150
得了  就好像你没拖着
Yeah, like you weren't holding out

862
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,900
你偷了我们点子的消息才说似的
on the news that you stole our idea.

863
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,470
得了  我才没偷什么
Oh, please, I didn't steal anything.

864
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,690
现在大家都开始做这个了
You know everyone's getting into this right now.

865
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,490
你不能瞒着我关于我们女儿的事
You can't keep things from me about our daughter.

866
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:07,360
事情就这么发生了
This just happened.

867
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:09,730
就这么发生了
It just happened.

868
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,570
我现在告诉你了  我们吃饭就为了这个
I'm telling you now. That's what these dinners are for.

869
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:12,820
你想每晚跟我吃晚饭吗
You want to have dinner with me every night?

870
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,100
并不想  我试了15年
Well, no, not really. I tried that for 15 years,

871
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:15,960
但还是没有得到全部的信息
didn't exactly get all the information then, either.

872
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,190
天呐  我们又开始旧事重提了  是吧
Oh, God. Yeah, we're really playin' all the hits, aren't we?

873
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,550
这种决定你无权自己做主
This is not the kind of decision you get to make on your own.

874
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:24,060
听我说  是海莉建的
Listen to me -- Haley built it, okay?

875
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,030
我们在帮她做大
And we're helping her make it into something more,

876
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,500
她很喜欢它
and she loves it, okay?

877
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,630
你想粉碎了它  随你
You want to crush that, go ahead.

878
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:30,610
但等你告诉她时
But when you break the news to her,

879
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,630
一定告诉她原因  妈妈的山寨公司
make sure you to tell her why -- that Mommy's knock-off company

880
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:33,970
争不过她建造的那个
couldn't compete with the one that she built.

881
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:37,140
戈登  这是个坏主意  听我的
Gordon, this is a bad idea, I'm telling you.

882
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,570
流浪者有全公司的支持
Rover has the full weight of the firm behind it,

883
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:42,360
它有势头  我现在想都阻止不了了
it's got momentum, and I couldn't stop it now if I tried.

884
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,720
听着  我们要建个网站
Listen. We're building the site.

885
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,580
随你怎么做吧
You do whatever you think is right.

886
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,650
你在干什么
What are you doing?

887
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,770
收拾行李
I'm unpacking.

It still feels random.

42
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,730
我搜了"达拉斯+牛仔队"
I searched "Dallas plus Cowboys,"

43
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,540
第一个好像是个烂大联盟粉丝网站
I'm sure the first hit is a crappy NFL fan site,

44
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,340
但是第二条搜索结果是什么鬼
but the second site that comes up?

45
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,210
没准流浪者知道你
Yeah, well, maybe Rover knows

46
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,870
压根不看橄榄球
you don't give a shit about football?

47
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,520
我忘了你在加大时是全美跑锋了
Yeah, I forgot you were an all-American running back at Cal.

48
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,250
我就去看过一场球
I went to a game once.

49
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,110
我只是说  流浪者在关联性上有问题
I'm just saying, Rover has a relevance problem.

50
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,400
-山达基教是宗教还是邪教  -邪教
- Is Scientology a religion or a cult? - Cult.

51
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,080
他们十月就申请到了非营利组织地位了
They obtained non-profit status in October.

52
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,090
算了  我自己想想往哪归类吧
Never mind, I'll figure out where it goes.

53
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,310
这些结果顶多只能说一般般
These results are mediocre at best.

54
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,780
流浪者"天才"搜索引擎最终得分  C-
Final grade for Rover's "genius" search engine, C-.

55
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,000
我看是D-
D-.

56
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,320
非得这么烧吗
Is that really necessary?

57
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,250
听动静不太对啊
That doesn't sound right.

58
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,470
-听起来油管好像...  -我能行
- Sounds like the, uh, gas line is... - I got it!

59
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,710
好吧
Okay.

60
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,760
反正我又不是从小就在修车店里打滚
Not like I literally grew up in an auto shop or anything.

61
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,560
等雨停了她就走
It's just until the rain stops.

62
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,330
吵得我心都乱了
Well, I can't hear myself think.

63
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,060
听着  如果他们调整好了关联性问题
Listen, if they fix the relevance problem,

64
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,110
那我们可能就有竞争对手了
we could have a competition on our hands.

65
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,120
要不再搜索一下...
You know, hit search for, um...

66
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,920
是流浪者吗
Is that Rover?

67
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,960
我们评分为C-
We give it a C-.

68
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,080
这么烂
That bad?

69
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,640
你真没用过吗
You really haven't seen it?

70
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,180
我还真没用过
No, I really haven't.

71
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,140
等等
Wait, uh...

72
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,330
我明白你什么意思了
Yeah. I see what you mean.

73
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,540
即使有基本规则引擎
Even with the basic rules engine,

74
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,730
结果还是太烂  网络爬虫太呆了
the results are garbage, the crawler's too static.

75
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,530
不过他们抓取网站标题的方法还挺聪明的
Still, the way they grabbed the titles is actually kind of clever.

76
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,210
-多谢你的意见  -再让我看看网站代码
- Okay, thanks for this... - Hey, I'm just gonna check the HTML,

77
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,720
就一小会儿
it takes one second.

78
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,990
好吧
Oh, yeah.

79
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,100
算法无法识别
The algorithm's too stupid to know

80
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,720
搜索关键词中的相关同义词
that there are equivalent synonyms for a search phrase,

81
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,190
或者不同的拼写
or different spellings.

82
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,470
比如美式拼写"颜色"
Like "color, c-o-l-o-r,"

83
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,200
就比英式拼写少一个字母"U"
the English spelling, with a "U."

84
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,830
不过我还是打个B-
Still, I'd give it a B-.

85
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,840
真的  概念绝对值个B
No, a solid B for concept,

86
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,660
但是执行太差  是个减分项
but demerits for poor execution.

87
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,040
你问的
You asked.

88
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,240
-其实我们没问  -我们根本没问
- Actually, we didn't. - No, we didn't.

89
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,500
谁都没开口
Neither one of us asked.

90
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,180
打败他们根本不难  知道吗
This wouldn't be hard to beat, you know?

91
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,420
只需要想出一种更精准的算法
You just have to come up with a more sophisticated algorithm.

92
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,060
这不是我们的思路
That's not really our approach.

93
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,020
人们需要更有组织的列表
People need a curated list,

94
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,950
需要一个指引他们在网络迷宫中行走的向导
a guide through the disorganized maze of the web...

95
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,510
而不是一堆不通人情的算法
not a bunch of impersonal math.

96
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,580
首先  我觉得算数很有人性
First of all, math is very personal to me.

97
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,610
-当然  我只是说  -其次
- Of course. I just mean that... - And second,

98
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,790
五百个网站你们组织起来容易
curation is fine if you guys have 500 websites,

99
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,000
或者五千个
or 5000.

100
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,260
但等有五百万个网站了  你们怎么办
But what are you guys gonna do when you have 5 million?

101
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,920
你们打算怎么引导用户应付那么多
How are you gonna guide people through that?

102
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,150
那我们就告诉你哪个网站最好
We tell you which site is best.

103
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,430
整个公司就是建立在人工处理的基础上
The whole company is built around a human approach.

104
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,940
-黄片警报  -来了  我来了
- Porn alert. - Yep. Yep. Coming.

105
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,310
根据公司规定
Following company protocol

106
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,110
-我将立即离开电脑  -我来了  来了
- and stepping away from the machine. - Coming. Coming.

107
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,620
-你生气了  -我没有
- You're mad. - I'm not.

108
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,230
-真没有  -我还以为你不想参与进来
- I'm not. - I didn't think you wanted to work on this,

109
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,660
但如果你想的话
but if you do, then...

110
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,470
-我不想  -好吧
- I don't. - Okay.

111
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,220
我只是想说
I'm j... I'm just saying that

112
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,810
算法没办法区分质量上的好坏
math can't tell a qualitative difference between good and bad.

113
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,090
电脑不能告诉我我想要什么
A computer can't tell me what I want.

114
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,850
现在还不能
Not yet.

115
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,100
好吧
Okay.

116
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,380
我们的功能还有问题
We have functionality issues.

117
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,910
用户的搜索结果前几条都不对
Users aren't getting something useful as their first return,

118
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,890
所以他们就不用了
so they're leaving the site.

119
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,850
说实话  我们上线太早了
Frankly, we launched too early...

120
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,290
我们有彗星这个强劲的竞争对手
We had a major competitor in Comet...

121
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,540
好吧  先别把事情都扯到彗星上去
Okay, let's try not to make this all about Comet.

122
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,800
-还要考虑到整个市场...  -没错
- There's the larger landscape of... - Exactly.

123
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,440
我们需要有存在感
We needed to get out there to have a presence.

124
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,480
彗星不是我们的竞争对手
Comet isn't competitive...

125
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,620
-我刚说什么来着  -抱歉
- What did I just say? - Sorry.

126
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,420
看来我们太心急了
It seems like we were impatient.

127
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,030
并不是  上线运行是好事
No. No. No, it's good that we're live.

128
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,060
真的
It is.

129
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,800
访问量早晚会起来的
The growth will be there.

130
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,150
流浪者的算法会越用越好的
The Rover algorithm's gonna get better with usage.

131
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,390
我们需要用户的访问足迹
We needed users to track,

132
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,980
更多数据会帮我们改进算法的
the data is gonna help us refine this algorithm.

133
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,940
我们必须得保持竞争力
We've got to stay competitive...

134
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,440
我告诉你  我们比彗星有优势
I'm telling you, we have a leg up on Comet...

135
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,500
-你说什么  -索引网站
- Excuse me. - Index sites.

136
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,130
谢谢
Thank you.

137
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,240
只要我们对我们的系统有信心
If we could just have faith in our system...

138
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,490
我当然有信心
Hey, I do have faith.

139
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,220
所以我才让网站上线了
That's why I launched the damn thing.

140
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,380
网站已经上线了
The site is live,

141
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,710
所以是否过早的问题已经没意义了
so the question of timing is a moot point.

142
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,580
求你们别跑来当着我的面吵架
Please don't come in here and argue at me.

143
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,310
-我手上的事太多了  -好吧
- I've got a lot of other things on my plate. - All right.

144
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,280
你们要是没统一意见
How can you lead this effectively

145
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,220
还怎么有效领导整个项目呢
if you're not speaking the same language?

146
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,450
商量好
Pull it together.

147
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,370
-谢谢  -明白
- Thank you. - Copy that.

148
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,130
眼下搜索市场正在跑马圈地
Search is a land grab, right now.

149
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,920
只要这块地盘圈住了
And once we grab all the land,

150
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,130
我们就能考虑加入更多代码了
then we can think about incorporating more code.

151
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,410
卡梅说得对
Cam's got a point.

152
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,340
目前的模型不能规模化
The current model isn't scalable.

153
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,450
我们三个人是跟不上网络扩张的
The three of us can't keep up with the expansion.

154
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,520
但我们不该加入更多代码
But we shouldn't add more code.

155
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,240
-而是该加入更多人  -多少人
- We should add more people. - How many?

156
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,520
总不能给所有人发糖果当工资吧
I mean, we can't pay everybody in Necco Wafers.

157
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,280
雇一个工程师是一回事
You know, hiring an engineer is one thing...

158
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,670
我们最强的版块是哪个
What's our strongest section?

159
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,980
-大概是喜剧  -没错
- Probably comedy. - Exactly.

160
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,330
海莉喜欢看喜剧
Haley loves comedy,

161
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,840
所以这个版块最全面  最有条理
so it's out most thorough, well-organized section.

162
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,290
那我们需要的就是专家
Well, then, we need experts.

163
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,730
就是那种
You know, someone...

164
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,490
那种痴迷于...
someone who's obsessed with like...

165
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,450
-运动  -运动的人
- Sports. - ...sports.

166
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,470
没错
Exactly.

167
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,320
我们需要更多的海莉
We need more Haleys.

168
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,290
可恶
Damn it!

169
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,110
对  获得图书馆学博士学位最酷的一点
Yeah, the... the best thing a-about a PhD in Library Science

170
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,580
就是我可以自称"图书馆学博士"
is I get to call myself a "Bibliothecographer."

171
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,580
你是芝加哥艺术馆的照片归档员
So you were a photography archivist at Chicago Art Institute.

172
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,050
听起来很厉害
Th-That sounds cool.

173
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,920
其实那里太冷
Hypothermic, actually,

174
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,370
我只待了一个冬天
I survived exactly one winter.

175
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,780
我是加州姑娘
I'm a California girl.

176
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,630
但不是大卫·李·罗斯那种风格的
But not in the David Lee Roth kind of way.

177
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,990
你能举例说明你的工作方法吗
Can you, uh... can you give us an example of your methodology?

178
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,180
比如说
For instance,

179
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,380
你怎么整理你的唱片
how do you organize your CDs?

180
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,180
这个嘛  我
Well, my, um...

181
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,910
我弟弟很喜欢重金属
my brother is really into metal,

182
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,580
所以我帮他整理唱片库
and I helped him manage his collection.

183
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,340
我把所有的死亡金属唱片放在一个架子上
I put all of the death metal CDs on one shelf,

184
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,790
死亡讣告和食人尸这类乐队
from the simple bands like Obituary and Cannibal Corpse

185
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,510
放最左  然后旋死和技术死放中间
on the left, to melodic and technical death in the middle,

186
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,170
然后是死亡/黑金
followed by death/black

187
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,760
碾核/死亡等交叉风格
and grind/death and death crossovers,

188
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,570
然后我把工业死
and then I put the industrial death,

189
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,910
民谣死和几乎不算死之类的放在最后
folk death, and barely-death, uh, at the end.

190
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,700
然后  另一个架子专门放黑金属
And... And then, the next shelf was for black metal,

191
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,030
从挪威黑金属
through the whole Norwegian scene,

192
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,370
像Mayhem和Burzum
like Mayhem and Burzum,

193
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,360
再到不黑
through the un-black

194
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,230
再到其实不黑但风格挺像黑的那种
and then the not-really-black-but-sorta-fits,

195
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,790
比如恶灵天皇
like Cradle of Filth.

196
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,720
另外还有
And... Oh, do...

197
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,840
要我继续说下去吗
do you want me to keep going?

198
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,340
还有邋遢力量
The-There's Raunchy Power...

199
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,580
不  已经很好了
No, that's perfect.

200
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,340
-邋遢力量  -一般人只是按首字母排列
- Raunchy Power? - Most people just alphabetize.

201
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,260
你确定是你弟弟的唱片库吗
You sure this was your brother's collection?

202
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,760
好吧  最后一个问题
Okay, one final thing...

203
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,620
一个关于"barks"[多义词]的网站
How would you list a website

204
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,850
你怎么归类
about "barks"?

205
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,610
看你是什么意思了  是狗吠  树皮
Depends if you mean dog noise, tree layer,

206
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,410
还是根汁汽水  拼写不太一样
root beer... that's Barq's with a "Q"...

207
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,120
还是船
or boat.

208
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,820
等等  还有船的意思吗
Wait. "B-Bark" Is a boat?

209
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,750
严格来讲是一种三桅帆船[barque]
technically, it's a sailing ship with three or more masts.

210
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,300
我们都不知道自己出的难题的答案
We don't even know the answer to our own trick question.

211
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,470
凯蒂·赫曼博士  你被录用了
Dr. Katie Herman, you are officially hired

212
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,840
你是彗星的首席本体论专家
as Comet's Chief Ontologist.

213
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,340
完美
Perfect.

214
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,200
来给你介绍一下各种"迷"吧
Let's introduce you to the obsessives.

215
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,590
或者  我们喊他们
Or, as we like to call them...

216
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,580
冲浪者
the surfers.

217
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,910
我们每天都能收到上百封邮件
Every day, we receive hundreds of e-mails

218
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,390
要求我们把他们的网站加入索引
from people asking us to add their websites to our index.

219
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,130
而且  我们也在不停地寻找
Plus, we're constantly on the look-out

220
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,430
新网站加入分类
for new sites to catalogue.

221
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,580
当冲浪者找到一个网站  会把网站分类
When a surfer finds a site, they categorize it

222
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,220
加入彗星网的总列表
and add it to Comet's master list.

223
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,890
每个小组都要添加索引条目
Each group is responsible for growing the index

224
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,560
并为每一门类下前五的网站写简介
and writing descriptions for the top five sites in each category.

225
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,640
是的  但问题是
Yeah, but the problem is,

226
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,780
我们一开始只有五大主题
is that we started out with five main topics.

227
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,360
随着新网站出现
As new sites pop up, you know,

228
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,900
给他们分类变得越来越复杂
categorizing them becomes more and more...complicated.

229
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,430
-本体论中有一个专门的术语  -一团乱
- Yeah, there's an ontological term for that. - Yeah -- "Shit-show."

230
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,160
好吧  先介绍一下娱乐
All right, let's start with Entertainment.

231
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,470
这是视频的雷吉
This is Reggie from Le Video --

232
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,410
他凭他对法国新浪潮
He, uh, impressed Joe

233
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,990
和约翰·坎迪的如数家珍
with his vast knowledge of French New Wave

234
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,820
-折服了乔  -是的
- as well as the canon of John Candy. - Yeah.

235
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,580
你知道他饰演过克里夫·默多克吗
Did you know that he played Cliff Murdoch,

236
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,300
《年度新秀奖》里的主持人
the Announcer in "Rookie of the Year"

237
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,560
-没被列入演职员表  -真的吗
- uncredited? - Really?

238
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,750
-是的  -厉害
- Yeah. - That's amazing.

239
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,710
-太酷了  雷吉  -回见了
- Really cool, Reggie. - Take care, all right?

240
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,520
-你看  热情让他们情绪高涨  -嗯
- See, enthusiasm feeds them. - Yeah.

241
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,350
这两位是洛林和波
So this is Lorraine and Po,

242
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,030
分别来自淘儿唱片和城市之光
from Tower Records and City Lights, respectively.

243
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,300
你们的喜剧达人呢
Where is your comedy geek?

244
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,400
-那个板块棒极了  -选得好
- That section rocks. - Good choice.

245
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,440
那其实是我女儿  海莉
That is actually my daughter Haley,

246
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,480
她也是我们的成员  她不上学的时候来
who's part of the team. When she's not at school.

247
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,710
-本地网站在这边  -好的
- And regional's over here. - Okay.

248
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,230
需要餐厅推荐的话
You need a restaurant recommendation?

249
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,520
找这几个小伙儿准没错
These are your guys.

250
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,240
不光是小伙儿啊
Not just guys.

251
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,670
瑞莎  我们在公交车上认识的
Risa. We met on a bus.

252
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,010
她发了一个餐厅排名列表
She launched into a list of restaurant ratings

253
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,630
能让扎格调查自惭形秽
that would put Zagat's to shame.

254
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,610
顺便一提  查格调查出了新网站
FYI, Zagat's has a new website,

255
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,780
但被商务队抢去了
but the Biz team scooped us --

256
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,470
查格调查是大企业
Zagat's is big business,

257
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,000
是国际的  不是本地的
it's international, not regional.

258
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,610
那是金牌健身俱乐部的麦基
That's Macky from Gold's Gym.

259
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,550
你不会相信的  但他有工商管理学硕士学位
You wouldn't believe it, but this guy's got an MBA.

260
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,680
市场部老大
Marketing honcho.

261
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,230
是我让金牌开网站的
I told Gold's to launch a website --

262
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,810
当他们终于采纳了这建议
And when they finally did --

263
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,470
我们就从本地手里抢走了它
we scooped it up from regional.

264
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,920
-各位  -你们可以互相引用
- Guys. - Well, you could cross-reference it.

265
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,330
没错  就这样  你理解我们的窘境了
Yes. Do that. So, you see our quandary.

266
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,430
商业  体育
Business, Sports...

267
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,170
-理解  -这是我们的首席程序员泰德
- I'm with ya. - This is our head coder. Ted.

268
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,170
整个网站都是他管理的
He manages the whole site for us.

269
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,560
抱歉打扰了
Sorry to interrupt,

270
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,880
美国在线的麦克·豪斯曼找你
you have a call from Michael Houseman at AOL.

271
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,960
完美  你可以随意...
Perfect. Feel free to, uh...

272
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,280

-麦克  -麦克  我是戈登
- Mike. - Mike, it's Gordon.

275
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,820
如果你来电是为卡奈特的事骂我
If you're calling to bust my balls about CalNect,

276
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,840
那可来不及了
you're a little bit late,

277
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,110
它早已被遗忘了
they've already been busted into oblivion.

278
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,160
真遗憾
I'm sorry to hear that.

279
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,400
我是想跟你说  美国在线在考虑开发搜索
I wanted to let you know -- AOL is in the market for a search play.

280
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,040
继续说
We're listening.

281
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,230
老实说  你们彗星的成就
Frankly, we're impressed by what you've got going on

282
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,460
让人佩服
over there at Comet.

283
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,920
巧妙  简练
Smart, lean.

284
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,140
我不想冒犯
I don't want to be too forward,

285
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,980
不过你们对收购有意向吗
but are you guys entertaining acquisition offers?

286
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,400
天哪  他们添加了简介
God, they've added editorial descriptions.

287
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,550
老天爷啊  好快
Jeez Louise, that was fast...

288
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,260
他们的算法是怎么做的
How're they doing their algorithm?

289
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,450
不是算法  是人做的
It's not an algorithm, it's people.

290
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,950
我们为什么不行
Well, why can't we do that?

291
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,000
给我首轮融资
Give me Series A,

292
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,230
我就雇四十个写手写广告
I'll hire 40 grunts to write blurbs.

293
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,080
我们还没到首轮融资的时候
We're not ready for Series A.

294
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,530
不要着急
Don't jump the gun.

295
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,970
你确定还要喝吗
You sure you need more of that?

296
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,630
我就靠这个活了
It's the only thing keeping me alive.

297
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,450
我们的网站和唐娜前夫的彗星
Isn't it a weird coincidence that we launched

298
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,090
在同一时间发布  你不觉得太巧了吗
just as Donna's ex-husband unveiled Comet?

299
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,570
大家都在搞搜索
Search was in the ether.

300
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,240
我们都不知道他们现在关系如何
We don't even know how much they talk to each other.

301
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,060
感觉她对整件事都很别扭
She just seems tweaked about the whole thing,

302
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,630
如坐针毡
like she's got a bug up her ass.

303
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,020
好了
All right.

304
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,190
告诉我最新进展  具体点
Give me the update. I want specifics.

305
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,450
维拉正在研究自然语言查询
Vera's been working on natural language queries,

306
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,530
试图让电脑理解
trying to make the computer understand

307
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,720
人类的提问方式
how humans ask questions.

308
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,080
我们只有一个程序员
We only have one coder.

309
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,960
西塞尔是顶尖的  但他工作量太大
Cecil's the best -- but he's overworked.

310
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,030
-艾略特  -伙计  这是事实  不是你的错
- Elliot-- - Dude, it's true. It's not your fault.

311
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,270
但如果能给他找些帮手
But if we could get him some help --

312
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,970
基本上  他在试图改善搜索算法
He's essentially trying to refine the search algorithm

313
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,570
并改进网络爬虫
and improve the crawler.

314
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,080
他无法同时做这两件事
He can't do both simultaneously.

315
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,530
选一下你想让我先解决哪个致命问题吧
Pick which horrible problem you want me to attack first.

316
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,240
事实上  我们是应该添一些人手
Yeah, hey, the truth is, we could use a few more bodies.

317
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,040
这位可以负责重头部分
Our man here can do the heavy lifting,

318
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,520
但他也需要一些支持
but he's gonna need some support.

319
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,050
-我们需要的是首轮融资  -艾略特
- What we need is Series A-- - Elliot --

320
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,470
你们近期内是拿不到首轮融资的
You guys are not getting a Series A term sheet anytime soon.

321
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,660
这正是我想要的
This is exactly what I was hoping for!

322
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,690
我朋友托丽·洛曼有一辆清风房车
My friend Tori Lowman had an Airstream,

323
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,050
我们以前在里面玩
we used to play in it.

324
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:40,810
是吗
Yeah?

325
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,660
你们都玩什么
What would you play?

326
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,510
清风啊
Airstream.

327
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,100
所以你们在计划越野旅行吗
So you're planning on a cross-country trip?

328
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,320
没有  我刚买了块地
No, I just bought a-a piece of land,

329
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,530
我需要先找个地方住
and I need something over my head

330
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,440
再去搭建更长久的建筑
before I build something more permanent.

331
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,100
是吗  哪里的地
Yeah? Where's the land?

332
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,970
-就在邦尼顿西边  -那里超美的
- Just west of Bonny Doon. - Ooh, that's so pretty.

333
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,280
-我懂  -是啊
- I know. - Yeah.

334
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,630
我丈夫伦尼和我
Well, my husband, Lenny, and I,

335
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,360
我们买了这辆好家伙去度蜜月
we bought this old sweetheart for our honeymoon.

336
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,980
它可是个宝
And, uh, she's a real jewel.

337
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,460
你们多久去一次那里
So, how often do you get up there?

338
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,760
我们才去了一次
We've only been once.

339
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,080
-但我们希望多去去那里  -没错
- But we're hoping to make it more often. - Yeah.

340
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,450
挺好
Okay.

341
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,410
去吧
Well, go on.

342
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,130
进去看看  里面非常舒适
Go on inside. It's nice and cozy.

343
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,840
床睡着也很舒服
And the bed's pretty comfortable, too.

344
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,620
我的天哪
Oh, my God!

345
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,870
简直完美
This is perfect!

346
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,960
这很...
It's...

347
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,620
很"舒适"
It's "cozy."

348
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,580
好吧
Yeah.

349
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,900
那么  美国在线
So...AOL, huh?

350
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,880
是啊
Yeah.

351
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,270
你真的还想再当个公司职员
You really ready to be a company man again?

352
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,590
如果价格够高的话
If the money -- money's good enough,

353
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,090
我可能会接受收购
I might take the buy-out.

354
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,260
去做点别的
Do something else.

355
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,970
-你可能会  -是啊
- You might. - Yeah.

356
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,330
莉迪娅让我们试试床
Lydia said to try it out...

357
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,000
那我们就试试
so let's try it out.

358
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,970
答应我
Promise me that,

359
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,540
无论报价如何  你都要考虑一下
whatever the offer is, you'll consider it.

360
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,020
我甚至觉得你应该接受
I kinda think you should take it.

361
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,400
因为我们的商业模式无法规模化吗
Because our business model won't scale?

362
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,320
-什么  -不是
- What? - No.

363
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,910
因为...
Because...

364
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,170
那样你就可以把所有空余时间都用来陪我了
then you can spend all that free time with me.

365
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,310
另外  我知道你最看重人"攻"了
Besides, I know you're all about the human touch.

366
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,170
这辆"蜜月花车"意味着你要搬出去了吗
Does this "Long, long trailer" mean you're moving out?

367
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,170
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}1953年美国喜剧电影

368
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,920
不
No.

369
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,580
这是给我们的
This is for us.

370
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,400
我们有这么多空间来...
We'll have all this room to just...

371
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,880
随心所欲
do whatever we want.

372
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,510
-我知道我想做什么  -我们该停下了
- I know what I want to do. - Okay, let's stop.

373
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,610
好吧  莉迪娅
All right, Lydia.

374
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,490
这么多年来她和伦尼都住下来了
And it worked for her and Lenny for all these years.

375
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,240
你是想让我像伦尼那样安顿下来吗
Are you trying to make an honest Lenny out of me?

376
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:24,830
我是想买下这车
I am trying to buy this, here,

377
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,810
这个宝
jewel...

378
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,410
然后带你进入梦幻之境
and sweep you away to a magical land.

379
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,200
我去给报价
I'm gonna make an offer.

380
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,370
妈妈  我们还去吗
Mom...? Are we going?

381
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,680
妈
Mom?

382
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,450
你不像是准备好了
You don't look ready.

383
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,350
我知道  亲爱的
I know, baby.

384
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,510
我
I just --

385
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,520
我不知道我今晚能不能出去了
I don't know if I'm up for it tonight.

386
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,020
-但你喜欢女生外出之夜的  -我是喜欢
- But you love girls' night out. - I do love it.

387
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,100
我就是觉得或许
I just thought maybe

388
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,290
我们这次可以在家里度过
we could have girls' night in this time?

389
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,180
是因为工作吗
Is it work?

390
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,900
我知道谈这事很怪
I know it's weird to talk about it.

391
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,960
没有  亲爱的  我们想聊什么都行的
No, honey. We can talk about whatever you want.

392
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,790
而且  是啊
And, yeah,

393
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,870
我们是有些问题
we've been having some trouble.

394
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,470
流浪者吗
With Rover?

395
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,600
它肯定会很赞的
Well, I'm sure it'll be awesome.

396
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,390
卡梅说她很喜欢的
I mean, Cam said she liked it.

397
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,390
卡梅伦什么时候说她喜欢流浪者了
When did Cameron say she liked Rover?

398
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,500
我不知道  几个月前吧
I don't know, like a couple months ago?

399
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,210
她说那个算法挺"聪明"
She said the algorithm was "clever."

400
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,330
知道什么才聪明吗
You know what's really clever

401
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,080
是你的理查德·普赖尔简介
is your Richard Pryor blurb.

402
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,510
谢谢
Thanks.

403
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,980
事实上  亲爱的  我们被你打得好惨
The truth is, baby, you are kicking our ass.

404
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,870
是啊
Well, you're right,

405
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,720
工作好累人
work is just so exhausting.

406
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,510
我们该放松一下
So, we should just relax.

407
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,440
是啊
Yes.

408
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,730
我们叫外卖吧
How about we order take-out?

409
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,060
好啊  我们能叫中餐吗
Oh, yeah, can we get Chinese?

410
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,010
-好啊  -我好喜欢锅贴
- Yeah. - I love potstickers!

411
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,600
你怎么穿着那个
Why are you wearing that?

412
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,050
我们要叫中餐外卖
We're gonna order Chinese food.

413
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,740
恶心
Hella gross.

414
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,000
味精会让我发胖
MSG makes me bloat,

415
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,640
叫披萨吧
just order pizza.

416
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,200
琼妮  你妹妹在看卡通呢
Joanie! Your sister was watching cartoons --

417
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,510
妈妈  天呐  那不是卡通
Mom, Jesus, it's not just cartoons --

418
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,470
她不介意的  是吧
She doesn't mind. Right?

419
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,160
嗯
Yeah.

420
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,340
看你想看的吧  叫披萨也行
Watch whatever you want. And pizza's fine.

421
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,320
不  亲爱的  锅贴呢
No, well, honey, what about, you know, potstickers?

422
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,760
我也没那么饿
I'm actually not that hungry.

423
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,050
卡梅伦"拖车"
Cameron "Howe-to" --

424
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,440
去吧
Go! Go!

425
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,440
我没懂笑点
I don't get it.

426
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,400
是不太好
Well, it's not one of my best.

427
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,730
酷啊
Cool.

428
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,760
真漂亮
Looks good.

429
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,070
乔  能帮我拿下食物吗
Joe, will you help me with the food?

430
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,250
好
Yeah.

431
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,850
嗯
Yeah.

432
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,490
很抱歉我们来迟了
I'm sorry we're so late.

433
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,480
-堵车  -报价到了吗
- The traffic was - Did the number come in?

434
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,000
三百万
Three million.

435
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,530
不错啊
That's...pretty good.

436
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,040
我们没要
We passed.

437
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,970
这是令人鼓舞
I-It's, uh, encouraging

438
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,030
这么早就吸引了注意
to get the interest so early on, you know.

439
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,760
但我们想试试找风投
We're gonna try the VC route.

440
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,790
有几家公司在试探
A couple firms are poking around.

441
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,640
听着  你今晚还来睡吗
Hey, listen, are you still sleeping over tonight,

442
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,540
还是你还得送戈登回家
or do you have to take Gordon home now?

443
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,390
不  博斯送他回去
No, Bos is gonna drive him back.

444
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,120
那好
Okay.

445
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,150
-好吗  -好
- Okay? - Okay.

446
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,750
我怎么会错过在
I wouldn't miss my first night

447
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,270
莉迪娅和伦尼的蜜月婚床上度过的第一晚
in Lydia and Lenny's Honeymoon Hotbed.

448
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,890
嗯  好吧
Yeah, well...

449
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,580
他们似乎进展挺好
They seem to be doing all right.

450
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,350
好吧
Well...

451
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,630
今晚起
as of tonight,

452
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,230
我正式算对他们将信将疑了
I'm officially giving them the benefit of the doubt.

453
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,710
你怎么样了
So how you doin'?

454
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,900
流浪者进展不错
Well, Rover's comin' along.

455
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,950
另一件事呢
Yeah, and that other thing?

456
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,430
我很高兴地报告
Yeah, well, I'm happy to report

457
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,910
我在慢慢摆脱那个麻烦
I'm digging myself out of that particular hole.

458
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,140
或许实际上没有听着那么糟
Probably sounded a lot worse than it was.

459
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,450
戈登  我之前也没想那样为难你的
Gordon, I -- I didn't mean to come at you like that,

460
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,680
整件事让我很过意不去
and I feel shitty about the whole thing.

461
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,830
博斯  得了  没事的
Bos, Bos, come on. Don't sweat it.

462
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,840
我听说美国在线要
Well, I heard AOL is gonna --

463
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,740
提出收购
gonna make you an offer.

464
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,940
你会接受吗
Are you gonna take it?

465
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,980
你怎么听到的
Now, how did you hear about that?

466
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,140
卡梅
Cam.

467
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,010
是啊
Yeah, right.

468
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,260
他们给我们压了低价  三百万
Turns out they low-balled the hell out of us at three mil.

469
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,050
他们现在在到处买
They're in a buying frenzy right now.

470
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,430
我和乔想坚持下去
Me and Joe want to play this thing out, so...

471
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,010
嗯
Yeah.

472
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,020
你怎么突然变机车党了
So when did you go all Hells Angels on us?

473
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,050
得了  那是辆小本田
Come on. It was a baby Honda!

474
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,760
差不多是轻型摩托了
It was technically a dirt bike.

475
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,130
是太空摩托才对
More like a Space Bike.

476
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,780
"太空摩托"
"A Space Bike."

477
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,800
闭嘴啦
Shut up!

478
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,490
总之  我现在换了
Anyway, I don't have one anymore.

479
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,390
-开卡车了  -是啊  太空卡车
- I drive a truck now, so... - Yeah. A Space Truck.

480
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,790
-好吧  -太空卡车
- Okay. - Space Truck.

481
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,430
你们还想再喝点啤酒吗  再来点吧
You guys want another beer? Let's have one more.

482
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,390
不了  我们还有人得开车呢
No, some of us gotta drive.

483
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,950
-来嘛  戈登  你不开车吧  -那倒好了
- Come on. Gordon, you don't have to drive. - I wish...

484
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,170
-来嘛  -我累坏了
- Come on. - ...but I'm beat.

485
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,110
走吧  博斯
Shall we, Bos?

486
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,670
我们该走了
I think we gotta roll.

487
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,950
走吧
Come on.

488
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,260
-好吧  -见到你真好
- Well, all right... - This was good to see you, man.

489
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,560
见到你也很高兴
Good to see you, too.

490
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,610
嗯
Yeah.

491
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,770
我送你
Yeah, I'll walk you out.

492
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,770
好
Okay.

493
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,650
那好  戈登
All right, Gordon.

494
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,640
-谢谢你送我了  -嗯  回见
- Thanks for the lift out. - Yeah, yeah. I'll see you soon.

495
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,350
-谢谢你过来  -不客气
- Well, thanks for coming by. - Sure. Yep. Yep.

496
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,520
见到你真好
Good to see you.

497
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,100
-谢谢帮我挂灯  -嗯
- Thanks for the help with the lights! - Yeah.

498
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,560
乔
Joe?

499
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,790
这位叫谭雅的姑娘
This girl here, this Tanya,

500
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,750
可比姓哈丁的那个好多了
much nicer than that Harding girl.

501
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,770
我的名字永远被一个
My name has been forever sullied

502
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,930
{\an3}谭雅·哈丁和南希·克里根
皆为花样滑冰选手

503
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,930
{\an3}94年1月的全美花滑锦标赛前
克里根被人打伤腿  只得退赛

504
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,930
{\an3}而哈丁得了冠军
但两人皆入选冬奥会

505
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,930
{\an3}媒体开始大肆报道
克里根的受伤

506
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,930
{\an3}以及此事可能跟哈丁
和其男友杰夫·古利有关

507
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,600
叫"古利"的男人抹黑了
by a man named "Gillooly."

508
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,300
我们有点冒险精神吧  好吗
Hey, let's get a little adventurous, shall we?

509
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,690
试试海胆
Um...let's try some uni?

510
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,490
-好  -好
- Yes. - Yes.

511
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,490
我想跟你谈谈西塞尔
I wanted to talk to you about Cecil.

512
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,520
他在整页方面还是有困难
He's still having trouble with whole pages.

513
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,110
他都做了一个月了
He's had a month.

514
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,580
或许他不是合适的人
Maybe he's not the guy.

515
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,670
想摆脱他可不容易
Well, it's gonna be a little hard to get rid of him.

516
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,750
他可是团队的创建成员
He's a founding member of the team,

517
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,530
还是首席技术官
CTO and all.

518
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,790
新来的在帮忙做苦工了
So the new kid's helping out with the grunt work,

519
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:13,690
但西塞尔还是应对不来编程的挑战
but Cecil still can't handle the programming challenge.

520
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,910
-慢用  -来
- Enjoy. - Here.

521
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,750
你一定得尝尝这个
You're gonna want to try this, dude.

522
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,080
嗯
Yeah.

523
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,650
这是传统日本灵魂食物
This is some old Japanese soul food.

524
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,010
你会喜欢的
You're gonna like this.

525
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,460
我也有事想问你
I wanted to ask you about something, too.

526
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,060
我听说美国在线对搜索有兴趣
Um, I heard that AOL is interested in a search play.

527
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,230
或许能摆脱这团麻烦
It might be a way outta this whole mess.

528
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,900
听着  我第一个承认
Look, I-I'll be the first to admit

529
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:45,520
我根本看不懂代码
that I don't know the ins and the outs of the code.

530
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,800
但在买卖公司方面
But when it comes to buying and selling companies,

531
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,570
那可以说是我的专长
you could say that's my bailiwick.

532
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,220
你觉得我们能卖多少
How much do you think we could get?

533
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,070
我的消息是三百万以上
My man says upwards of three million.

534
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,570
好吧  我们得偿还天使投资人
Okay, we have to pay off the angel investors --

535
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,640
那也不赖
Yeah, we'll do all right.

536
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,230
每人能拿到40万
We'll do all right, about 400K apiece.

537
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:06,800
但团队
But the team --

538
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,250
他们能分到近一百万现金
They split almost $1 million in cash.

539
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,730
这对一群新人来说很不错了
Now that's pretty good for a bunch of young upstarts.

540
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,180
-但他们有三个人  -我知道
- But there's three of them. - No, I know.

541
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,490
-这主意  我真觉得不...  -听着
- This idea -- I really just don't think - It's -- Look, it's --

542
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,040
这总归不是个小数目
i-it's still nothing to sneeze at.

543
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,210
对你是个胜利
Hell, it's a win for you,

544
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,500
让你能很好地迎接下一个项目
it sets you up great for your next thing.

545
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,690
再说  遗憾的是
Besides, the sad truth is,

546
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,750
所有用我们的网站搜索的人都不是很满意
anyone done a search with us leaves underwhelmed.

547
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,320
流浪者搜索量第一的词条是"性"
The top search on Rover is "sex."

548
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,080
第二是"彗星"
The second most popular search...is "Comet."

549
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,300
流浪者搜索量第一的词条是"性"
The most popular word being searched on Rover is "sex."

550
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,580
第二是"彗星"
The second most popular word is "Comet."

551
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,250
你明天应该会接到一通电话
You should get a call in the next day.

552
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,380
报价大概会是三百万
Expect the offer to be around $3 million.

553
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,600
博斯是代表你们两个人吗
Can I assume that Bos speaks for the both of you?

554
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:02,210
博斯  你在销售方面很有经验
Bos, you have a lot of wisdom when it comes to sales.

555
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,970
但我们不能现在出局
But we can't get out now.

556
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,770
我们有可能获得成功
We have a winning play here.

557
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,020
我们以算法为基础的系统有六个模仿网站
Our algorithm-based system has a half dozen copycats.

558
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,880
但彗星没有  为什么
Comet doesn't. Why?

559
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,580
因为据预计  到年底网络会扩大一倍
Because web growth is projected to double by the end of this year,

560
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,290
到95年底就能达到三倍
triple by the close of '95.

561
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,730
正是因为有竞争对手才应该退出
The competition is exactly the reason to get out now.

562
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,200
我们没有合适的程序
We don't have the right damn programmer --

563
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,130
是你说  我们不"小打小闹"
You said we don't make "small plays."

564
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,050
我们"出手要大"
We take "big swings."

565
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,890
我的直觉告诉我
What I know, in my gut,

566
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,500
搜索能成为
is that search is poised

567
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,460
价值上亿的行业
to be a billion-dollar business.

568
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,980
我不管你在高尔夫球场上遇到了谁
I don't care who you run into on the golf course,

569
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,630
你不能跟我之外的人讨论我的资产
you don't discuss my assets with anyone but me.

570
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,270
如果需要给流浪者换领导才能取胜
If the path to victory requires a change in the Rover leadership,

571
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,320
那我们可以讨论
we can discuss that.

572
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,800
但现在  有点勇气
But, in the meantime, have some grit.

573
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:03,970
我叫你们统一了阵线再进来
I told you to come in here and present a united front.

574
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:07,180
不要跑来跟老板抱怨
Don't come whining to the boss.

575
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,500
这是最常见的扯淡
This is 101 bullshit.

576
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,330
你们都得拿出更好的表现
Do better. Both of you.

577
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,450
你们走出去时
And when you walk out that door,

578
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,840
要往同一个方向走
I want to see you head in the same damn direction.

579
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,930
谢谢你刚刚支持我
Well, thanks for having my back in there.

580
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:35,960
你欠第一国家银行32.6万
You owe $326,000 to First National Bank.

581
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,930
我从11月就知道了
I've known since November.

582
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,170
你在复印室里打印银行文件
You've been running off bank paperwork in the copy room

583
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,730
就像把那儿当成自己家似的
like it's your home office.

584
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,470
-你有张单子落下了  -等等的
- You missed a sheet. - Hey, wait a minute --

585
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,530
听着  我明白你想干什么
Hey, listen, I see what you're up to.

586
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,810
你想把流浪者丢给第一个出现的买家
You want to unload Rover to the first buyer

587
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,810
好让你自己赶紧捞一笔
so you can get a quick windfall.

588
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:52,150
-但你  -长远的计划  首轮融资
- Oh, but you -- The long-game, Series A --

589
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,160
是帮不了你的
that won't solve your problem.

590
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,780
这事我可没说出去
I haven't breathed a word about this.

591
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,620
我也不会说的
And I'm not going to.

592
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,740
因为我会支持你
Because I have your back.

593
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,090
真希望你也支持了我们
I just wish you had ours.

594
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,630
兄弟们  找到一个
Dudes, got one!

595
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,660
说真的
Seriously, guys,

596
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,900
格兰德威尔-布里斯托尔最合适了
Gladwell, Bristol is the perfect fit.

597
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,660
-找到一个  -我们好棒
- Got one! - Yay, us!

598
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,630
怎么回事
What is up?

599
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,650
是我们的每周网站索引比赛
It's our weekly website indexing contest,

600
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,490
截止周五  索引最多网站的队伍获胜
the team with the most sites by the end of Friday wins.

601
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,170
-快点  -还有2分钟
- Go, go, go! - 2-minute warning.

602
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,310
-接近吗  -不相上下  海莉也加入了
- We're close? - Neck and neck. Haley's in the mix.

603
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,310
我们过去吧  走
We should get down there. Come on.

604
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,680
我们以前按话题分组
So we used to cluster the groups by topic,

605
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,360
但我们的首席本体论专家认为
but our Chief Ontologist found that

606
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,260
分享信息能提高生产力
it boosted productivity to share info,

607
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,090
所以她把团队分成了七大组
so she's put the teams into seven master groups.

608
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,770
-找到一个  -好诶
- Got one! - Aooga!!

609
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,640
好诶
All right!

610
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,410
很好  他们追上来了
All right, they're inching up.

611
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,710
加油  窈窕奶爸  你们知道这多重要
Come on, Mrs. Doubtfire, you know what's at stake.

612
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,230
像1989年那样研究网络
Research the web like it's 1989!

613
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,580
-找到一个  -我们好棒
- I got one! - Yay us!

614
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,570
很好  加油  燃烧组
Yes! Step it up, burners.

615
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,580
让方达骄傲
Make Fonda proud.

616
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,060
兄弟们  找到一个
Dudes, got one!

617
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,060
来吧  燃烧组
Oh, it is on, burners!

618
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,340
他们似乎很有冲劲  大奖是什么
They seem pretty fired up. What's the grand prize?

619
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,800
-金牌吗  -比那还好
- Olympic Gold? - Better.

620
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,450
好了  时间不多了
Okay, we don't have much time.

621
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,310
就要到了
We're almost there.

622
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,550
胜负就要分出来了
We almost find out who the victor is.

623
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,120
我们好棒
Yay, us!

624
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,580
好接近啊
It is so close.

625
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,650
-找到一个  -好诶
- Got one! - Aooga!!

626
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,010
加油  好了  马上了
Go! Oh! Okay, we're there!

627
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,590
加油  加油
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

628
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,590
我刚登记了一个萝茜·奥唐纳的网站
I just logged a Rosie O'Donnell site!

629
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,110
好诶
All right!

630
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,880
等等  不不  放我下来
Wait. No. No, no, no. Put me down.

631
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,730
好了  冲浪板
All right. Surfboard!

632
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,030
好啊  冲浪板
Yay! Surfboard!

633
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,910
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

634
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,270
爸爸  过来
Hey, Dad -- Hey, Dad -- come over here!

635
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,590
你确定不是该你了吗
Are you sure it's not your turn?

636
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,220
绝对不是
Definitely not.

637
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,310
好吧
All right.

638
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,120
好啊
All right!

639
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,400
准备好了吗
You ready?

640
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,190
好了  冷静点
All right, calm down!

641
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,790
关掉啊
Turn off!

642
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,090
该死
Goddamn.

643
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,980
你干什么
What are you doing?

644
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:50,470
滑冰要开始了
Skating is coming on.

645
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,630
谭雅和南希  整个美国都在看
It's Tonya and Nancy, and all of America is watching,

646
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,750
我想看看结果如何
so I want to see what happens.

647
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,880
我在看《真实世界》
I was watching "Real World,"

648
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,220
这一集里大卫会被赶走
and it's the episode where David gets kicked off

649
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,430
-因为扯塔米的床单  -谁在乎啊
- for pulling the sheets off of Tami-- - Oh, my God. Who cares?

650
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,150
-那才不是真的  -姑娘们  别吵
- It's not even "Real." - Girls, can you please?

651
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,080
我在网上读到说
I read something online

652
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,710
那些闹剧都是他们有意编排的
that said they generate all the drama.

653
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:02,880
就像你
Kind of like you.

654
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,790
那是什么
What is that?

655
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,790
金滑板
It's a golden surfboard.

656
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,770
为什么会在你这儿
Yeah, why do you have that?

657
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,080
亲爱的  那是哪来的
Honey, where did you get that?

658
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,650
是彗星的
Well, it's from Comet.

659
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,170
我知道拿个彗星的奖杯回来很奇怪
And I know it's weird to have a Comet trophy

660
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,880
毕竟你在为流浪者忙里忙外
when you're working so hard on Rover --

661
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,750
不会
No.

662
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,100
上面为什么写着"锅贴"
Why does it say "Potstickers"?

663
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,360
因为我赢了
Because I won it!

664
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,280
瑞莎当时在为红花餐厅网站写简介
Risa was doing a write-up for the Benihana website,

665
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,240
我就跟她说我喜欢锅贴
and I told her that I love potstickers

666
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,610
她就把我们队起名叫锅贴  今天我们赢了
so she named our team Potstickers, and today we won.

667
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,200
我们干翻了燃烧激情
And we kicked Feel the Burn's ass!

668
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,840
大家都欢呼了  他们放了超赞的冲浪音乐
And everyone cheered, and they played this crazy surfer music,

669
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,520
我还冲爸爸的脸上扔了庆祝派
and I got to throw the ceremonial pie in Dad's face!

670
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,090
什么
What?!

671
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,790
是啊  可赞了
I know! It was amazing!

672
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,690
好吧  南希要热身了
Okay, Nancy's about to warm up.

673
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,690
你是我姐姐  我知道你内心深处
You're my sister, and I know deep in your heart

674
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,490
是想观看这个重大的文化事件  并吃冰淇淋的
you want to watch this major cultural event and eat ice cream

675
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:49,040
-而不只是抽恶心的烟  -闭嘴
- and not just smoke disgusting cigarettes... - Shut up!

676
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,340
对大家拉着个脸
...and scowl at everyone.

677
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,230
-来吧  妈妈  来  -好吧
- Come on. Mom, come on. - Okay.

678
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,290
没有什么能阻拦她
And nothing is going to hold her back.

679
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,980
那好吧
Well, all right. Okay.

680
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,890
真希望我有机会冲爸爸脸上丢派
I-I wish I got to throw a pie in Dad's face.

681
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,560
我也想
Yeah, you and me both.

682
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,540
-厉害  -好啊
- Ooh, sassy. - All right.

683
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,220
-我错过了什么  -加油  南希
- What'd I miss? - Go, Nancy.

684
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,490
你觉得他们速度有多快
How fast do you think they're going?

685
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,150
-你看得到吗  -嗯
- Hey, can you see okay? - Yeah.

686
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:16,220
我能很好地看到你耳朵后面的奶油痂
I've got a perfect view of the crust of Cool Whip behind your ear.

687
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,660
什么
What?

688
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,530
来
Here.

689
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,180
我擦吧  没事的
I got it. I got it. Don't worry about it.

690
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,870
-谁能比她更好  -是很好
- Who is gonna top that? - It's good.

691
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,290
这下我更紧张了
Now I'm even more nervous.

692
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,890
我不知道你打算回家
I didn't know you were coming home.

693
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,320
要一起来吗
You wanna join us?

694
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,550
第一跳是三转空翻
Now this first jump is a triple flip.

695
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,730
我得去洗个澡
I got to take a shower.

696
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,640
再见
Bye.

697
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,170
知道吗  她是个斗士
You know what? She's a fighter.

698
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,430
就我的了解  她会为每一个动作使出全力
If I know her, she's gonna fight for every triple from here on out.

699
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,810
怎么回事
Hey, what happened?

700
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,580
对不起
I'm sorry.

701
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,690
我
I...

702
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,730
回头再告诉你吧
I'll tell you later.

703
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,680
我不是有意闯进来的
I didn't mean to barge in.

704
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,950
没有
No, not at all. I, um...

705
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,750
我想给你介绍大家
I wanted to introduce you to everyone.

706
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,380
我们需要人打破平局
Hey, we need a tie-breaker.

707
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,510
你站南希还是谭雅
Are you Team Nancy or Team Tonya?

708
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,300
那是滑冰选手吗
Are those skater people?

709
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,550
我要去睡了
I'm just gonna go to bed.

710
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,420
才过去三分钟
Into the program only three minutes.

711
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,160
现在要进入最难的三...
Now going into the hardest triple --

712
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,440
勾手三周
a triple lutz.

713
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,050
下次你听到滴水声
You know, the next time you hear a drip...

714
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,480
该死
Damn it!

715
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,570
最好温柔点操作
...you might want to try a gentler approach.

716
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,260
对了  我知道这看上去什么样
I know how this looks, by the way.

717
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:34,360
就好像我提前经历了可悲的中年危机
Like I'm having some pathetic, early mid-life crisis.

718
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,640
机车  卡车  拖车
Got the bike, the truck, the trailer.

719
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,390
不不  恰恰相反
No. No, on the contrary.

720
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:46,610
其实  你冒了险
Actually, no, you took a risk,

721
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,920
你脱离了自己的"安全区"
you got out of your "comfort zone."

722
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:50,740
我为你骄傲
I'm proud of you.

723
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,030
得了
Right.

724
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,350
我的新家陷在泥巴里了
My new home got stuck in the mud.

725
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:57,920
是啊  最好的人也难免遇到这种事
Yeah, well, happens to the best of us.

726
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,600
偶尔拜托人帮忙没什么可耻的
There's no shame in asking for a little help now and again.

727
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,050
你怎么会知道怎么做这些的
How do you know how to do all this anyway?

728
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:11,230
你家族有住拖车的历史吗
You come from a long line of trailer folk?

729
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:16,800
其实  也差不多
Well, truly, that ain't far off.

730
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,530
给  这个你留着
Here. Why don't you keep this.

731
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,330
没准哪天又用上了
You never know when it's gonna come in handy.

732
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,340
要喝点什么吗
You want a drink?

733
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,800
不了
Nope.

734
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,630
我不喝了
I'm good.

735
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,550
但你可以去我车上
But you could run out to my truck

736
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:36,080
我的工具包在座位上
and, on the seat, there's my tool bag.

737
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,130
把管道工的腻子给我拿来
Grab me the plumber's putty out of there.

738
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,790
-一个小油罐  -好
- Little can. - Okay.

739
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:40,970
谢谢
Thanks.

740
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,860
我要把你的指甲锉弄脏了
I'm dirtying up your nail file...

741
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,340
还是刷子
...or brush thing...

742
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,650
什么的
or whatever you...

743
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,690
我没找到
I couldn't find it.

744
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,940
你的船怎么样了
Hey, how's your boat?

745
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:38,170
我把能变卖的都卖了
Well, I liquidated whatever I could,

746
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,180
还把养老金全取了出来
zeroed out my IRA.

747
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,270
我本打算卖家具的
I was ready to auction off all the furniture.

748
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,330
但是
But I thought --

749
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,490
又怕黛安发现
well, I thought Diane might notice

750
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,500
她的古董餐具架不见了
if her antique buffet turned up missing.

751
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,110
可以解决的
It could work out.

752
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,260
流浪者或许能成功呢
Rover might succeed.

753
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,760
不  我几个月前看过
No, I looked at it a couple months ago,

754
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,470
虽然还不成型
it wasn't there yet.

755
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,840
但我喜欢那个模型
But I liked the model.

756
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,920
我们的程序员
Our programmer's been

757
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,280
几个月来一直挠破头
banging his head against the wall for months

758
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,210
想改进算法
trying to refine that algorithm.

759
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,710
唐娜又不肯卖
And Donna won't sell it.

760
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,220
我看得出迹象
I recognize the signs,

761
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,090
这个项目不行的
this thing is gonna die on the vine.

762
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,640
我是说
I mean...

763
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,700
我们完了
We're screwed.

764
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,380
我们完蛋透了
We're so screwed,

765
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:27,610
完蛋的光
the light from screwed

766
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,770
要几千年才能照到我们
gonna take a thousand years to reach us.

767
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,660
等等  你有多完蛋
Wait, how screwed are you?

768
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,350
我们没有好领导
We don't got the leadership,

769
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,830
没有好算法
we don't got that algorithm,

770
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,260
也没有人才
and we don't got that talent.

771
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,260
也就是说  亲爱的
In a word, darlin',

772
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,110
我们没有你
we don't got you.

773
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,410
他卡在哪里了
What part is he stuck on?

774
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,130
我就是说  凯蒂·赫曼博士
I'm just saying, Dr. Katie Herman

775
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:08,390
对你颇为本体论地关注
gives you a lot of ontological attention.

776
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,020
嗯  她挺友好的
Yeah. She's friendly.

777
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,930
很好  重摆
Nice scratch.

778
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,250
她对我可没那么友好
She's not friendly with me.

779
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,730
是啊
Yeah, well,

780
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,610
你和卡梅伦·豪伊博士怎么样了
how are things with you and Dr. Cameron Howe?

781
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,890
那辆清风房车挺舒服的吧
Must be pretty snug out there in that Airstream.

782
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:24,400
就像两个住在顶针里的巨人
Like two giants living in a thimble.

783
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:31,960
就差一点
So close.

784
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,200
尝试可嘉
Excellent try.

785
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,690
挺好  她...
So, it's -- it's good. She's, um...

786
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:38,270
她想寻找什么
She's looking for something,

787
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,800
我觉得她在无人区是找不到的
and I don't think she's gonna find it in no man's land.

788
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,930
但是
But, um....

789
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:48,290
我过意不去  因为她很喜欢  但是
I feel bad, because she's so into it, but...

790
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,960
我很讨厌那地方
...I hate it out there.

791
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,800
我总忍不住去想磕头虫
And I can't stop thinking about click beetles.

792
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,020
磕头虫是什么
What's a click beetle?

793
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,710
你还自称喜欢户外活动呢
You call yourself an outdoorsman.

794
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,040
你在荒野里
So, you're in the wild,

795
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,110
能听到一种滴答响
and you hear this clicking sound.

796
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,200
你以为自己要疯了
And you think you're going crazy

797
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,040
或是突然爆发耳鸣了
or have sudden onset tinnitus,

798
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,270
但事实上  是你的耳蜗里进了种
but in fact, there's an ear-dwelling beetle

799
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,260
钻耳朵的虫子
in your cochlea --

800
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,490
真的  你会死的
I'm serious -- and you turn up dead.

801
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,980
那只虫子就在你脑袋边
With a beetle next to your head.

802
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,420
因为  它爬出来了
Because, you know, it crawls out.

803
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,530
就在你死后
When you die.

804
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,210
乔  那是《星际迷航2》里的
Joe, that was in "Star Trek II."

805
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,640
-没看过  -你看过的
- Never seen it. - Yes, you have.

806
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,540
磕头虫是真的
And click beetles are real.

807
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,460
-好棒  -厉害
- Yes! - Nice!

808
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,650
虽然没瞄那个的  但也算
Wasn't aiming for that one, but it counts.

809
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:37,000
你觉得格兰德威尔-布里斯托尔
So what do you think of Gladwell, Bristol

810
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,170
厉害的风投公司怎么样
and their smokin' VC operation?

811
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,910
我本来对美国在线的收购提议很期待的
Well, you know, I was excited about the AOL offer.

812
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,990
但后来又不感兴趣了
Until I wasn't.

813
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,310
然后我又对风投方案充满期待
And then I was excited about the VC route.

814
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:47,040
但又不感兴趣了
Until I wasn't, so...

815
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:50,940
你究竟期待什么
What are you... really excited about?

816
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,150
这个
This.

817
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,380
你和我
You and me.

818
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,070
这里
Here.

819
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,070
好吧
Okay...

820
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,660
如果你进了这一球
If you make this shot,

821
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,780
我们就拿风投的钱
we're taking the VC money.

822
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,240
好
Fine.

823
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:24,200
-我们不拿他们的钱  -好  再摆上
- We're not taking the money. - Okay, okay. Rack 'em.

824
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,530
开始吧
Here we go.

825
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,620
好了
Okay, okay.

826
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,740
那么
So...

827
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,100
你们都知道
So, uh, as you all know,

828
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,350
我们起初有些不顺利
we got off to kind of a rocky start --

829
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:43,740
但上个月  你们突然实现了大逆转
but last month, suddenly, you really turned it around.

830
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,930
真是太棒了
Just...

831
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,230
功劳属于西塞尔
Credit goes to Cecil

832
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,010
在算法上获得了突破
for his breakthrough with the algorithm.

833
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,430
-恭喜  -西塞尔
- Yay! - Cecil!

834
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,100
我们很骄傲
We are so proud

835
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,980
给你们提供首轮融资
to offer you Series A financing.

836
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,960
敬流浪者
To Rover.

837
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,100
敬流浪者
To Rover!

838
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:05,890
-干得好  -谢谢
- Good job. - Thank you.

839
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:06,590
唐娜
Donna.

840
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,830
我欠你个道歉
I owe you an apology.

841
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,700
我起初没看出来  但这个真的很厉害
I didn't see it at first, but this thing is killer.

842
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,740
你的人干得太棒了
I mean, your guy nailed it.

843
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,710
-是啊  是这样  -嗯
- Yeah. He really did. - Yeah.

844
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,020
敬坚持
To perseverance.

845
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,920
恭喜
Congratulations.

846
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,970
感觉很棒吧
Well, that must feel really good.

847
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:29,200
我知道这个很不容易
Look, I know it's been a tough one,

848
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,630
考虑到我们一个月以前的处境
and given where we were a month ago,

849
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,450
肯定觉得像一发曲线球吧
it must feel like a curve ball.

850
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,460
但会有收获的  等着看吧
But it will pay off, you'll see.

851
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,290
你真的办成了
You really pulled this off.

852
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,790
而且正及时
And just in the nick.

853
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,310
一个月前
About a month ago,

854
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,730
唐娜本打算把它们卖给美国在线的
Donna was gonna dump the whole thing to AOL.

855
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,470
-我们都很高兴  -是啊
- It's been good for all of us. - Oh, I agree.

856
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,010
你们认识吗
Oh, you know each other, right?

857
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,640
你把局面完全打开了
So you really cracked the whole thing wide open.

858
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,810
怎么做到的
How'd you do it?

859
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,520
其实点子是博斯出的
Bos actually had the initial idea,

860
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,750
我们称之为"等候室"概念
what we call the, uh, the "waiting room" concept --

861
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,670
嗯  人们经常等待
Yeah, people wait around all the time,

862
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,710
他们都习惯了
they're used to it.

863
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:08,020
现实生活中也是  网上也是
In -- In real life. On the web.

864
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:12,400
我想出了个"排队程序"
I, uh, came up with a "queuing program."

865
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:16,620
我们是第一个索引整个网页的网站
Now we're the first site to, uh, index entire pages.

866
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,890
我们有个网络爬虫
You know, um, we had a crawler,

867
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:21,450
但很原始
but it was a rude one...

868
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:24,280
是啊  我们得好好调教它一下
Sure, we had to teach that little sucker some manners.

869
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,000
打扰
Excuse me.

870
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,250
我就是想感谢你没放弃我们
I just wanted to thank you. For not giving up on us.

871
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,260
你稳住了大局
You steered the ship.

872
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,870
你该为自己骄傲
You should be proud of yourself.

873
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:36,300
你成了大明星啊
So, you're the star of the show.

874
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,790
是啊
Y-Yeah.

875
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:40,910
-发展喜人啊  -是啊
- The, uh -- the growth has been incredible. - Yeah.

876
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,620
我就是有点意外
Well, I was just a little bit surprised.

877
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:45,510
因为之前你困住了好久
Because, well, you know, you'd struggled for so long.

878
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:48,490
我得问一句
So I just -- I have to ask...

879
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,530
是谁写的新算法
Who wrote the new algorithm?

880
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,260
我无法相信
I cannot believe

881
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,750
流浪者得到了首轮融资
that Rover is getting a Series A term sheet.

882
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,500
现在  突然间
Now, all of a sudden,

883
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,800
我们要应付一个资本雄厚的噩梦了
we're up against this capitalized nightmare.

884
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:05,720
什么网络爬虫跟数据索引交互
Some new "crawler" interacting with the data indexing,

885
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,940
这能害死我们
it could kill us...

886
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:10,310
我们为竞争得分散精力
We've got to divide our focus just to compete.

887
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:13,600
但我们的方法  人工处理
But our whole approach, the human touch,

888
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,820
现在完全完...
it's -- it's now completely and totally f--

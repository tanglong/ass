37
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,610
我就是有点意外
Well, I was just a little bit surprised.

38
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,370
因为之前你困住了好久
Because, well, you know, you'd struggled for so long.

39
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,430
我得问一句
So I just -- I have to ask...

40
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,440
是谁写的新算法
Who wrote the new algorithm?

41
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,340
是我写的啊
I mean, I did.

42
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,640
但是还是多亏了博斯
Though I gotta give Bos credit.

43
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,830
他的想法很不错
He had a great idea.

44
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,290
我们把那叫做
Yeah, we're calling it the, uh,

45
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,520
"等候室"概念
the "waiting room" concept.

46
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,320
人们可以在现实生活中排队  在网上也能如此
People wait in line in life. Why not on the web?

47
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,360
所以我写了个排队程序
So I-I created a-a queuing program.

48
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,380
我们的网络爬虫很粗糙[粗鲁]
Yeah. Our crawler was rude.

49
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,580
我得好好调教它一下
I had to teach that sucker some manners.

50
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,780
那你好好玩
Well, uh, you enjoy the party.

51
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,730
不
No!

52
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,930
-天啊  -怎么了
- Oh, my God. - What is wrong?

53
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,360
真是太烦了
This is so annoying.

54
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,250
怎么了  是卡梅隆的游戏吗
What is that? Cameron's game?

55
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,910
我以为那个测评人是个混蛋  但是...
I thought that review guy was just an asshole, but...

56
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,350
这根本不可能
...this is actually impossible.

57
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,100
她好像根本就不想让人赢
Like, she doesn't want anyone to actually win.

58
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,720
你这三个都试过了吗
Well, did you try all three of these?

59
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,900
这三个都会让你回到起点
They all take you back to the beginning.

60
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,570
我去拿冰淇淋
I'm getting ice cream.

61
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,790
你觉得我会是个好间谍吗
Hey, you think I'd make a good spy?

62
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,010
我在前台留了号码
I leave message here on service,

63
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,230
但你怎么没打给我啊
but you do not call.

64
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,770
怎么  你想看点别的吗
Why? Do you want to watch something else?

65
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,400
不  其实我还挺喜欢的
No! I'm really into it.

66
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,530
-是吗  -她的口音太搞笑了
- Yeah? - Her accent is ridiculous.

67
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,200
你看了这个电影
How many times have you viewed

68
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,360
多少次了
this moving-picture show?

69
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,530
天啊  我不知道  太多次了  我都数不清了
Geez, I don't know. Too many times. I've lost count.

70
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,400
-在电影院看了四次  -天啊
- Four in the theater. - Oh, my God.

71
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,540
别这样  我喜欢的东西就很喜欢
Easy. I like what I like.

72
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,590
我喜欢你很喜欢你喜欢的东西
I like that you like what you like.

73
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,740
你最喜欢这种  完全可以理解
Totally makes sense that it's your favorite, though.

74
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,850
这话是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

75
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,920
你开玩笑嘛
Are you kidding me?

76
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,950
这片子是讲一群吊儿郎当的家伙
It's a motley crew of dude friends pulling capers

77
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,350
只凭自己宅宅的技术和一股勇气
with nothing more than nerdy technical skills

78
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,690
搞出的一堆事端
and a dash of moxie.

79
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,690
"好运将会降临在你身边"
"Functioning superbly does come automatically to me."

80
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,650
运气
Fortunes!

81
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,100
你的是什么
What did you get?

82
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,520
什么  我看看
What? Let me see!

83
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,970
"你的有缘人即将到来"
"An exciting 'Tim' is coming my way."

84
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,930
该死
Damn it!

85
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,970
他肯定很喜欢摇摆舞
And I'll bet he likes swing dancing.

86
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,940
为什么会喜欢摇摆舞
Why swing dancing?

87
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,080
你不是每周五晚都会去吗
Yeah, isn't that the thing that you do every Friday night?

88
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,630
是轮滑
Roller derby.

89
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,830
真的吗
Seriously?

90
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,910
真不知道你怎么会把这两个东西搞混
I don't even know how you mix those two up.

91
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,300
那我得说  我脑子里想的全是
Well, in my defense, I was incredibly distracted

92
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,210
和你做爱
by how bad I wanted to sleep with you.

93
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,670
算你聪明
Nice save.

94
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,460
轮滑
Roller derby, huh?

95
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,410
真性感
That's hot.

96
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,370
我知道  你明天想来吗
I know. You want to come tomorrow?

97
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,320
好啊  好啊好啊
Yes. Yes, yes, I do.

98
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,550
等等
Wait.

99
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,800
明天轮到我看孩子
Yeah, I think I got the girls tomorrow.

100
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,130
好吧
Okay.

101
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,680
我也不知道
Well, I don't know.

102
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,800
要不
Maybe...

103
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,440
要不我问问她们想不想跟来
Maybe I'll see if they want to come, too.

104
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,560
好
Okay.

105
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,310
那好
Okay then.

106
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,950
我能不能倒回去一点
Do you mind if we rewind a bit?

107
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,610
我可不想错过一点刺激冒险
I don't want to miss any madcap adventures.

108
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,190
我们可不止错过一点了
Oh, I think we've missed way more than a bit.

109
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,100
我在前台留了号码
I leave message here on service,

110
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,610
但你怎么没打给我啊
but you do not call.

111
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,330
再看一遍
One more time.

112
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,410
我在前台留了号码  但你怎么没打给我啊
I leave message here on service, but you do not call.

113
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,450
然后那个人大老远地赶来我的住处
And then the guy drove all the way back to my house

114
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,870
把我忘拿了的包送过来
to bring me the bag that I forgot

115
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,720
因为他说他知道我舍不得我最爱喝的饮料
'cause he said he knew I loved my Yoo-hoo.

116
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,190
你能相信吗
Can you believe that?

117
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,740
他们简直是我遇见过的最好心的人了
I mean, these people are the nicest people on the planet.

118
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,150
住在城里还有什么好处啊
I don't know why anyone lives in the city anymore.

119
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,210
比如你不用开半小时车去超市买吃喝
So you don't have to drive 30 minutes to get your groceries.

120
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,340
-是吧  -说得对
- I mean... - Good point.

121
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,320
我们也并不是全错
We weren't totally wrong, though.

122
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,790
什么
What?

123
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,670
彗星
Comet.

124
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,890
搜索市场本来就是抢滩圈地
Search was always a land grab.

125
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,610
可我本以为我们占领了高地
But I thought we planted a flag.

126
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,390
结果有了这么一大笔钱
Now, flush with all that cash,

127
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,600
流浪者的进化速度我们根本不能比
Rover will be able to innovate in ways that we cannot,

128
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,260
尤其是凭目前的构架
especially with the current structure.

129
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,310
所以我
So I...

130
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,350
我想说的是
What I guess I'm trying to say is...

131
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,500
你说得对
you were right.

132
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,670
算法搜索就是未来方向
Algorithmic search is the future--

133
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,250
该死
Shit.

134
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,040
你没事吧
You okay?

135
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,780
没事
Yeah.

136
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,480
我不知道我们为什么没有及时调整
I don't know why we would wait to pivot.

137
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,770
今晚我要在清风房车过夜
I think I'm gonna stay at the Airstream tonight.

138
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,930
什么
What?

139
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,310
等你到了都11点了
It'll be 11:00 by the time you get there.

140
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,120
那好吧  想去就去  不过
All right, yeah. Do what you want, but...

141
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,630
-怎么了  -我只是
- What? - I-I was really hoping

142
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,780
非常希望你明早能和我一起去彗星
you'd come in to Comet with me in the morning.

143
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,910
我希望能和戈登组织一次头脑风暴
I want to have a-a brainstorming session with Gordon,

144
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,170
你的见解会非常有帮助
and we could really use your perspective.

145
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,380
乔  我不是故意和你提起
Joe, I didn't mean to get in your head

146
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,770
-什么算法的事的  好吗  -你
- about the algorithm thing, okay? - You --

147
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,990
-别纠结了  -不是你提的  是流浪者
- Forget it. - You didn't. Rover did.

148
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,220
你们现在做的就挺好的
You should just keep doing what you were doing.

149
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,840
你们的方法非常  特别
You have a very... unique approach.

150
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,620
就一天  要不两天
One day, maybe two.

151
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,600
不  我现在不想掺和到
No. I don't want to get in the middle of things

152
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,370
你和戈登之间
with you and Gordon right now.

153
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,780
我不是让你来调解
I'm not asking you to mediate.

154
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,670
我是说我们公私分明非常重要
I'm telling you it's important that we keep things separate.

155
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,540
卡梅  流浪者就要碾压我们了
Cam, Rover is gonna kick our ass.

156
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,050
又不能怨我
That's not my fault!

157
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,700
我也没说怨你  我
I didn't say it was your fault. I'm --

158
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,310
我在向你求助
I'm asking for your help.

159
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,690
是啊  现在才说
Yeah, now.

160
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,080
我都说你是对的了
I said that you were right.

161
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,430
好吧  你和戈登之前不希望我
Okay, you and Gordon didn't want me

162
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,170
加入你们的小团体
to be a part of your little club.

163
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,750
你当时都不肯听我说话
You weren't even listening to me.

164
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,800
不是的
That is not true.

165
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,910
我问过你是否想参与
I asked you if you wanted to be involved,

166
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,060
而你拒绝了我
and you turned me down.

167
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,340
我还问过你是否想搬进来
I also asked if you wanted to move in,

168
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,940
你也不想
and you don't want to do that, either.

169
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,530
我经常邀你去房车
I ask you out to the Airstream all the time.

170
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,520
我在那里面都直不起腰
I can't stand up in the damn thing!

171
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,580
我已经很迁就你
Look, I've been really understanding with you,

172
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,260
非常耐心了
beyond patient.

173
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,040
抱歉
I'm sorry.

174
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,060
我没意识到我们还在算计这个
I didn't realize we were running a tab.

175
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,760
凯蒂快输给我了
I got Katie on the ropes.

176
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,830
我在放水让他赢
I'm letting him win.

177
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,160
别胡扯  看我手劲
Oh, please. Get a load of this wrist! Aah!

178
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,220
不
No!

179
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,910
看招
Look at that one!

180
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,330
戈登
Gordon!

181
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,190
怎么了
What?

182
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,370
我都听不到自己思考了
I can't hear myself think.

183
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,230
是你想买这个的  你自己选地方摆的
You wanted the thing. You picked the place for it.

184
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,620
今天可是周五
Look. It's Friday, okay?

185
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,870
只有两队人没有做完
All but two teams have clear queues.

186
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,390
休息一下  别想了
Maybe take a break from thinking.

187
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,640
现在我输入"达拉斯牛仔队"
So now when I put in "Dallas Cowboys,"

188
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,830
排在最前的搜索结果是最热门的粉丝网站
the first results are the top fan sites.

189
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,300
好吧  他们做了改进  这是不可避免的
Okay, so they've improved. That was inevitable.

190
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,450
麻烦的是接下来的几个结果
It's the next few results where we're in trouble.

by our friends the Dallas Cowboys.

196
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,280
我不明白
I don't get it.

197
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,350
我们上次看这个时
I mean, the last time we looked at it,

198
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,410
这还是缺点
that was a bad thing.

199
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,830
那时它们排得太靠前
Then they rank too high.

200
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,990
他们成功让搜索结果
They've managed to make the results

201
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,510
对于一般用户来说足够准确
accurate for the average user

202
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,330
同时还能考虑到非主流人群
while still accounting for the outlier.

203
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,430
非常厉害
It's brilliant.

204
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,070
如果结果这么厉害  那么
Well, if the results are that impressive, then --

205
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,060
就是这么厉害
They are!

206
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,190
我们需要扩建编程团队

雇佣分析员  统计学家

208
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,030
听着
Look.

209
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,830
这个可就有得谈了
This is a much larger conversation.

210
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,980
那我们就谈
So let's have it.

211
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,320
可今天是周五
It-- It's Friday.

212
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,020
大多数人都有空
And most of the queues are clear.

213
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,470
好吧
Okay.

214
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,090
增长已经变缓
Growth has slowed.

215
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,850
但我们仍在增长
Yet we're still growing.

216
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,320
这样下去的话长久不了
Not for long with this.

217
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,610
不  我觉得你夸大其词了
No, I think you're overstating things.

218
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,680
我理解你的顾虑
Look, I get it

219
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,370
你是担心我们付不起这个钱
if you don't think we're gonna be able to pay for it.

220
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,120
我觉得你第一次就做对了
I think you were right the first time.

221
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,400
我们现有的可行
What we have is working.

222
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,670
彗星很棒
Comet is great.

223
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,900
你能放松一点吗
Okay? Will you please just relax?

224
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,310
行吗
Okay?

225
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,800
凯蒂就玩桌上冰球  还拿挺高的工资
We sure are paying Katie a hell of a lot to play air hockey.

226
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,510
好吧
Okay.

227
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,380
你究竟想干什么
What's this really about?

228
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,380
-保障这家公司的未来  -是吗
- Ensuring the future of this company. - Yeah?

229
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,500
因为在我看来  一切如常
Because from where I stand, everything seems fine.

230
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,960
而你  今早一进来
You, on the other hand, walked in here this morning

231
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,720
就像有人往你的燕麦粥里拉了屎一样
like somebody took a dump in your oatmeal.

232
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,510
是吗
Oh, yeah?

233
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,320
在我看来  
From where I stand,

234
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,460
你似乎对这家公司的情况毫不在意
it looks like you don't care what happens to this company

235
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,630
只要你能继续上首席本体论专家
as long as you get to keep screwing the chief ontologist!

236
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,250
要不你去透透气吧

Sure. Sure, nice do.

243
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,240
是啊  我特别兴奋
Yeah, I was so wired.

244
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,700
我大半夜没睡着  看那个算法
I stayed up half the night, looking at that algorithm.

245
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,840
太了不起了  你不觉得吗
It's just so impressive, don't you think?

246
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,050
西塞尔真的做到了
Cecil really came through.

247
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:43,910
第一张表单上写了
On the top sheet,

248
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,130
我们要将首席财务官这个职位外包出去...
you'll see we're outsourcing the CFO role --

249
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,020
他仅用一次完美的更新
I mean, he solved every problem

250
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,930
就解决了困扰了他好几个月的难题
he's been wrestling with for months in one elegant update.

251
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,160
我想他可能是终于找到了灵感
Well, I guess the muse finally had something to say.

252
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,820
你不奇怪是什么卡了他这么久吗
Don't you wonder what took him so long?

253
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,060
并不
I don't.

254
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,080
我们稍后再谈编程部扩招
Let's put a pin in expanding the programming department for now.

西塞尔在重压下表现得如此可圈可点 
Cecil performed so well under pressure,

256
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,790

257
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,740
这听起来会有点怪  但是...
This is gonna sound a little weird, but...

258
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,800
有首歌一直在我脑中挥之不去 
I got this song stuck in my head,

259
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,280
但我想不起来是什么歌了...

260

很喜欢玩这个

这不是一首歌吧
That can't be a song.

268
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,810
是有缘人的最爱
It's exciting Tim's favorite.

269
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,340
我不知道
I don't know.

270
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,820
或许是我编的歌
Maybe I made it up.

271
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,680
你一定能想起来的
I bet it will come to you.

272
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,470
是吗
Yeah?

273
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,450
当你最不抱期望的时候
When you least expect it.

274
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,790
真的吗
Oh, yeah?

275
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,010
我不想小题大做
I don't want to make it more of a thing,

276
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,460
但今天乔...
but Joe today --

277
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,740
是啊  听我说...

278
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,390
这真的没有借口
There's really no excuse,

279
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,110
但有时候  乔就会...

280
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,710
海莉为此很尴尬
It just got awkward with Haley,

281
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,830
也许你该和她谈谈
and maybe you should talk to her.

282
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,380
怎么了  她说什么了吗
What? Did she say something?

283
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,400
没有
No.

284
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,380
她肯定听到乔的话了  所以
I'm sure she heard him, so...

285
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,170
她知道我们在约会

对  约会是知道

聊我的性生活吗
with my 14-year-old daughter about my sex life?

289
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,780
不是  我也说不好啦
No. No. I don't know.

290
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,270
-怎么了  -也许吧
- What? - Maybe!

291
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,640
她现在跟我怪怪的
She just got weird with me.

292
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,490
听着
Okay, listen.

293
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,730
如果海莉的态度你都接受不了的话
If you can't handle a little weirdness with Haley,

294
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,050
那你肯定过不了琼妮那关
there's no way you're surviving trial by Joanie.

295
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,250
好吧
Fair enough.

296
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,510
我会做好心理准备的
Okay. I'll pack extra padding.

297
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,810
天呐
Oh, geez!

298
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,280
你还好吗
Are you okay?

299
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,490
还好
Yeah.

300
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,550
我能进去吗
Can I come in?

301
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,330
当然
Sure.

302
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,610
喝咖啡吗
Coffee?

303
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,950
-好的  -好
- Sure. - Yeah.

304
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,130
你没回我的邮件
You haven't responded to my e-mails.

305
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,900
不是
No.

306
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,150
我就是有一阵没查邮件了
I just haven't checked in a while.

307
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,530
抱歉  经过雅达利那事之后
Sorry. After everything with Atari, I just...

308
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,370
当然  那事我很遗憾
Oh, yeah. I'm -- I'm sorry to hear about that.

309
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,550
我知道你很努力
No, I know you worked hard.

310
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,580
等等  你该不会大老远来这儿
Oh, wait. You didn't come all the way out here

311
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,230
只是因为担心我吧
'cause you were worried about me, did you?

312
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,310
我要和几个开发人员见面
I had meetings with a few developers.

313
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,540
那好
Cool.

314
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,600
一石多跨大洲鸟
Many birds, one transcontinental stone.

315
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,010
那你确实是来打我的
So you are here to kill me.

316
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,510
我需要你签个字
I just need you to sign these.

317
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,940
好
Sure.

318
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,910
你就不能寄过来吗
You couldn't mail them?

319
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,470
我寄了
I did.

320
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,690
和你的日记还有毛衣一起寄过来的
They were in the box with your journals and the sweater.

321
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,380
好吧
Okay.

322
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,190
等等  你没收到吗
Wait. Did you not get them?

323
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,720
不  收到了
No, I did.

324
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,320
但是箱子被卡车撞了
Uh, it got hit by a truck.

325
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:57,900
好吧  卡梅
Okay, Cam.

326
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,500
真的  我知道听起来
No, I-I know it sounds...

327
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,690
我
I...

328
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,570
你就告诉我签哪儿吧
I'll just sign whatever you want.

329
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,220
这太不可理喻了
This is insane.

330
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,300
说真的  她这是疯了
Seriously, she has lost her mind!

331
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,070
各位好
Hey, guys.

332
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,700
我有几分钟时间  就想过来看看
Just had a few minutes and thought I'd check in.

333
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,880
博斯和谭雅跟你们说了我的想法吗
Have Bos and Tanya walked you through my thinking?

334
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,790
我们正在说呢
Uh, yeah, we're working through that right now.

335
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,720
恕我直言  我们觉得应该
With respect, we would prefer

336
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,610
先雇用编程人员
to prioritize programming hires.

337
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,220
我能理解这种想法
Yeah, I understand the instinct.

338
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,310
在大多数情况下  我也同意  但是
And in most circumstances, I would agree. But --

339
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,880
没有员工的前提下先找业务发展主管
It makes no sense to bring in a head of business development

340
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,980
这根本不合理
when we don't have a staff!

341
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,950
我们只是在讨论  兄弟
Hey, we're just talking here, dude.

342
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,570
我们很感激你的领导  唐娜
We're all grateful for your leadership, Donna,

343
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,630
但我觉得我们已经完全证明了自己
but I think that we have more than proven ourselves.

344
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,080
我会很感激
And I would appreciate it --

345
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,800
我们都会感激能让我们
Well, we would all appreciate the respect

346
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,570
在没有那么多干涉的情况下
of being able to run our own company

347
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,800
经营我们自己的公司
without this much interference.

348
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,860
你是一位极其出色的程序员
You are an excellent programmer.

349
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,720
谢谢
Thanks.

350
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,220
考虑到过去的几个月里
And considering all you've accomplished

351
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,620
你所达成的成就
in the last couple months,

352
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,520
我不觉得招募新的工程师
I don't see a big value add

353
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,930
能带来很大的价值
in additional engineers.

354
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,870
我懂
Yeah, I-I get that.

355
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,320
但是
but, you know, I mean,

356
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,240
想想如果我不需要再操心
think of -- think of what I could accomplish

357
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,870
细枝末节或是数据库
if I didn't have to worry about the cosmetic stuff

358
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:11,670
我又能成就多少
or the database.

359
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,050
那些很让人分心
It's just distracting.

360
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,880
而如果我能专注于
And if I could just focus on --

361
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,610
功能性的开发
on developing functionality,

362
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,690
那将有无限可能
you know, who knows what's possible?

363
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,540
所以你并不需要程序员  你只需要打杂的
So you don't need programmers. You just need coding grunts?

364
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,310
都要  两种都要
Uh, well, both. We need both.

365
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,070
那么
Well...

366
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,880
我会满足你的需求
I want you to have what you need.

367
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,670
-谢谢你  -谢谢
- Thank you. - Thanks.

368
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,100
你不会后悔的
You won't regret it.

369
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,720
但网页搜索的概念并非我们专有
But the idea of search isn't proprietary,

370
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,960
而我们的流程却是的
and our process, however, is.

371
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,300
所以在我引进新的人才之前
So before we bring in any outside talent,

372
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,670
你还是先和我们的法律团队一起
why don't we get you with our legal team

373
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,460
申请所有必要的专利吧
and file all the necessary patents?

374
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,220
我们拿到种子基金的时候已经申过了
We did that back when we got seed.

375
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,380
那个专利是针对医疗记录索引的
That patent was for a medical records indexing method.

376
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,060
你觉得那能囊括西塞尔最近的创新吗
Do you believe that covers Cecil's recent innovations?

377
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,470
律师团会需要详细的技术参数
The lawyers are gonna want detailed specifications --

378
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,330
算法的原理和功能  书面的
how it works, what it does -- in writing.

379
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,980
你不觉得我们有点过于谨慎了吗
And I -- Don't you think we're being overly cautious here?

380
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,580
不  我觉得我们谨慎得刚刚好
No, I think I'm being the exact right amount of cautious.

381
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,290
这应该不是问题吧
I assume that's not gonna be a problem.

382
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,320
不  完全不是
No. No problem at all.

383
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,450
一旦我们搞定知识产权
Once we lock down the I.P.,

384
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,220
你们想要多少工程师就能招多少
you can have all the engineers you want.

385
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,450
我跟你说  她知道了
I'm telling you, she knows.

386
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,480
她在怀疑  但她什么都无法证明
She's got her suspicions. She can't prove anything.

387
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,110
谁管她能不能证明
Who cares if she can prove it?

388
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,990
她可以让我的生活一团糟  她已经做到了
She can make my life miserable. She already is.

389
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,420
你得给我镇定下来  好吗
You've gotta get it the hell together, all right?

390
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,030
和律师团谈  告诉他们整个机理
Get with the lawyers, walk them through how this thing works,

391
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,470
然后继续下一阶段
and then move on.

392
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,920
我知道唐娜也会的
I know Donna will, too.

393
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,760
你根本没听进去我的话  我做不到
You're not hearing me. I can't.

394
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,130
那里面有我写的程序块
All right, there are these chunks of what I wrote in there,

395
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,470
我只知道它们之间是怎么关联的
but the way it's connected, I-I get what's happening,

396
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,770
但我无法解释为什么
but I can't explain it.

397
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,250
写这些程序的人高我一个层次  老兄
Whoever wrote this is on another level, man.

398
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,300
-别贬低你自己  -你去问那人要具体参数吧
- No, don't sell yourself short. - Go ask him for the damn specs.

399
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,630
你知道怎么做这些...
You know how to do all--

400
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,650
我有点沮丧我们无从知道
You know, I'm kind of bummed we're never gonna find out

401
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,260
那到底是什么声音
what that sound was.

402
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,790
我没跟你说啊
I never told you.

403
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,420
没  是什么
No. What?

404
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,860
你绝不会相信的
You're not gonna believe it.

405
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,800
-是个老妇人被捆在了床上  -接近了
- It's an old woman tied to a bed. - Close.

406
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,140
是只椅子上的鹦鹉
It's a parrot on a chair.

407
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,080
-什么  -老大了
- What? - A huge one.

408
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,600
可能是只金刚鹦鹉
A macaw, maybe.

409
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,490
不  那是人类尖叫的声音
No. The screams were human.

410
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,800
是啊
I know.

411
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,410
等等  你怎么进去的
Wait. How did you get in?

412
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,610
真辅的公寓漏水
There was a leak in Shinsuke's apartment,

413
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,850
敏明只得为水管工打开了他们家的门
so Toshiaki had to open the place up for a plumber,

414
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,020
我知道那是我唯一的机会了
and I just knew that that was my only chance.

415
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,090
那刮蹭声呢
What -- What about the scraping?

416
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,420
是椅子
It's a chair.

417
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,310
什么
What?

418
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,570
是椅子
It's the chair.

419
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,180
就是那种金属椅子
One of those metal ones with the --

420
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,430
后面刻着心
with the heart on the back.

421
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,570
鸟能把椅子从一扇窗
The bird would drag the chair...

422
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,370
拖到另一扇那里
from one window to another.

423
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,950
起初  我没搞懂是为什么
And at first, I couldn't figure out why,

424
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,550
直到我看到巷子里有只猫
until I saw that there's a cat in the alley.

425
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,230
他们在玩跨种族的
So they had this intraspecies

426
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,320
躲猫猫游戏
game of peek-a-boo going on.

427
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,610
太奇怪了
It's so bizarre.

428
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,460
-是一只鸟  -嗯
- So a bird... - Yeah.

429
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,410
用喙  拖着那把椅子
...drags the chair... with its beak?

430
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,490
老大一只鸟了
It's a big bird.

431
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,110
不会的  我不信
No, I don't believe you.

432
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,970
我为什么要撒谎呢
Well, why would I lie about that?

433
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,120
你要搬去哪
Where are you moving?

434
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,260
我们在世田谷区找了栋房子
We got a place in Setagaya-ku.

435
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,690
在郊区吗
The suburbs?

436
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,570
没想到啊
That is...unexpected.

437
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,020
我们要生孩子了
We're having a baby.

438
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,590
我替你高兴
I'm happy for you.

439
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,190
谢谢
Thanks.

440
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,160
好了
All right.

441
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,680
你看上去挺好的
You seem good.

442
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,000
我是挺好
I am.

443
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,250
对不起
I'm sorry.

444
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,210
一切都很对不起
For all of it.

445
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,420
嗯
Yeah.

446
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,480
再见
Itterasshai!

447
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,650
我要回家了  但我去溜冰场能顺道送你
I'm heading home, but you're on my way to the rink,

448
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,060
如果你想...
so if you want me to --

449
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,810
你没事吧
Feeling all right?

450
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,880
嗯  没什么可写的
Yeah. Nothing to report.

451
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,950
7点你家见
7:00 at your spot?

452
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,300
好啊
You got it.

453
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,190
戈登·克拉克
Gordon Clark.

454
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,930
他在吗  他不接电话
Is he around? He's not picking up.

455
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,100
嗯  我去找找他
Yeah. Let me see if I can get him.

456
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,430
好
Okay.

457
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,080
卡梅打来了
Cam's on the line.

458
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,500
我都不知道我是在解决什么问题
I don't even know what problem I'm trying to solve.

459
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,590
我不知道他在哪  我回头让他打给你吧
Look, I don't know where he is. Can I have him call you?

460
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,810
好  再见
Okay. Bye.

461
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,080
或许我们加个搜索栏
Maybe we add a search bar.

462
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,720
不像流浪者的爬虫那样  但我们让用户可以
Not with a crawler like Rover, but we give users the option

463
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,150
在我们的索引内搜索
to search our own index.

464
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,250
好
Okay.

465
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,770
这我可以同意
I mean, I could get behind that.

466
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,940
是吗  我也不清楚
Yeah? I don't know.

467
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,190
怎么了  伙计
What's going on, man?

468
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:28,330
我在那下面
I was just down there,

469
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,090
在一堆便贴里待了三年
surrounded by Post-it notes for three years,

470
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,830
我刚觉得自己已经掌握了大局
and just when I feel like I've got my arms around it...

471
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,750
却又看不到了
I can't see it anymore.

472
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,470
我们又是在谈未来的事了
So we're talking about the future again.

473
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,680
我该给她打回去
I should call her back.

474
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,100
这是你十年前所预见的吗
Is this what you saw 10 years ago?

475
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,140
因为当年你跑来我车库时
Because it's not what I saw for myself

476
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,000
我可没想象到会是这样
when you showed up in my garage.

477
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,570
问题就在这里
That's the point.

478
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,730
重点从来都不是结果
It was never about where it ended up.

479
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,930
而是感觉
It was... about how it felt.

480
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,820
我看得到未来时
When I saw it...

481
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,240
我知道跟你建立样东西会是什么感觉
I knew how it would feel to build something with you.

482
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,640
但这...
But this --

483
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,120
周五下午  一片清净
Friday afternoon, all the queues are clear --

484
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,400
我不知道接下来会怎么样
I don't know what comes next.

485
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,800
我们大部分人类
Most of us in the human race,

486
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,130
我们都无从得知接下来会如何
we don't get to know what's next.

487
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,200
我们只能随机应变
I mean, we just feel shit as it's thrown at us.

488
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:32,680
我们只有此时此刻
This right now is all there is.

489
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,670
欢迎来到未来  乔·麦克米伦
Welcome to the future, Joe MacMillan.

490
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,110
我不敢说别人  但是
I mean, I can't speak for anyone else, but...

491
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,510
我是很高兴有你在的
I'm sure glad to have you here.

492
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,730
之前的事很抱歉
I'm really sorry about earlier.

493
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,440
没事的
Don't worry about it.

494
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,690
但如果你再在我孩子面前
But if you ever scream about my sex life

495
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,180
为我私生活的事吼我
in front of my kid again...

496
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,350
我会扯下你的脑袋  冲你喉咙里拉屎
I will rip off your head and shit down your throat.

497
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,270
搜索栏是个好点子
Search bar is a good idea.

498
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,040
我们该做那个
We should do that.

499
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,370
你好啊
Hey, there!

500
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,120
我不是有意这么突然闯过来
Well, I don't mean to barge in on you like this.

501
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,700
我找你一天了
I been trying you all day.

502
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,560
所以就来碰碰运气
Thought I'd take a flyer.

503
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,560
我正好有事呢
You know what, I'm just in the middle of something.

504
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,470
我们可以回头说吗
Do you mind if we talk later?

505
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,460
这事要不了多久
No, this won't take but a sec.

506
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,150
乔在吗
Is Joe around?

507
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,200
不  他正要回家
No. He's uh, on his way home.

508
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,220
-你要找他吗  -不
- Do you need to talk to him? - No.

509
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,430
就找你  亲爱的
Just you, darling.

510
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,820
听着
Look.

511
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,310
我知道我们怎么说的
I know what we said,

512
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:46,860
要是还有别的办法
and I wouldn't ask,

513
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,060
-我也不会求你  卡梅  -不行
- Cam, if there's any other way. - No!

514
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,710
-我也没办法  -不行
- I wouldn't ask. - No.

515
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,130
不行  博斯  我们说好不再加补丁  更新
No. Bos, we said no patches, no updates.

516
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,280
那一次就完了
It was a one-time deal.

517
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,170
不  没那么麻烦
No, it's nothing that grand.

518
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,270
我就是需要技术参数  好申请专利
I just need a little help with the tech specs for the patent.

519
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,380
什么  你是说  他做了一半工作
What? You're telling me he wrote half the work,

520
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,770
还没法解释清楚吗
and he can't explain it to you?

521
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,950
他需要点指导
Well, he could use some guidance, huh?

522
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,480
就跟他通会儿电话
Just a few minutes on the phone.

523
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,090
天呐  不行
Jesus. No!

524
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,420
你答应过这事不会再找回到我身上来
You promised me that this would never come back to me.

525
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,620
是不会的
No, and it won't.

526
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,500
不会的  西塞尔没理由说出去
It won't. Cecil got no reason to spill.

527
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,440
天呐  这太蠢了
Oh, God. This is so stupid.

528
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,620
你为什么不能跟她直说
Why can't you just talk to her?

529
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,830
好吧
Sure, sure.

530
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,300
只要你肯告诉乔
Soon as you tell Joe.

531
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,940
你真希望他
You really want him --

532
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,570
你希望他都知道吗
You want him to know about all this?

533
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,500
听着  卡梅
Look, Cam.

534
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,700
你走吧
Okay, you need to leave.

535
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,170
卡梅
Cam.

536
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,560
这对我们都有好处
This is gonna help the both of us.

537
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,260
不  这是个错误
No, this was a mistake.

538
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,150
我们再也不要谈起这事了
We don't talk about this again.

539
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,610
卡梅  求你
Cam, please.

540
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,670
卡梅
Cam?

541
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,320
卡梅
Cam!

542
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,990
卡梅  求你
Cam, please.

543
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,630
我本该放过他的
I should have let it slide,

544
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,510
但都十年了  我一直假装没看到他会
but after a decade of pretending to not notice him kick the ball

545
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,780
把高尔夫当足球一样踢
back on the fairway like it was soccer...

546
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,740
我要么得说点什么
I was either gonna have to say something

547
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,210
要么就要开小车撞他了
or run him over with a cart.

548
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,400
天呐  他一定气坏了
Oh, God, he must have been furious.

549
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,800
他没表露出来
He covered well.

550
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,510
他又打了两个洞  才找了个借口
It took him two more holes before he found an excuse

551
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,250
放弃不打了
to wrap his nine iron a tree.

552
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,350
我也是个好胜的人
You know, I'm as competitive as they come,

553
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:20,560
但我无法想象一个人怎么会那么大胆地作弊
but I can't imagine what compels a person to cheat so brazenly.

554
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,800
那是一生都被人告知获胜是你的天赋权利
A long life of being told that winning is your birthright.

555
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,920
约翰说得好
John had a good line.

556
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,850
你怎么说得来着  约翰
What was that? John.

557
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,850
-什么  -关于伊莱亚斯
- What? - About Elias.

558
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,830
他就是只小龙虾
Yeah, man's just a little lobster,

559
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,860
当自己是小龙虾之王了
convinced he's king of the crawdads.

560
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,230
真逗
Funny.

561
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,370
你去买单吧
Why don't you get the check?

562
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,460
我还是无法相信
I still can't believe it.

563
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,970
她也该停止放水让那白痴赢了
Well, yeah, it's about time she stopped letting that yahoo win.

564
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,720
她让杆让得太狠了
It was killing her handicap.

565
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,750
不  你明白我的意思
No, you know what I'm talking about.

566
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,780
我们今晚就别聊这个了  唐娜
Let's take the night off, Donna.

567
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,500
真是奇迹啊
I mean, it's miraculous, really.

568
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,710
那孩子又不是能走在水上
The kid can't walk on water.

569
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,780
我想到个点子  让他改变了思路
I had an idea. It shifted his thinking.

570
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,100
仅此而已
That's all.

571
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,600
只是这点子也太厉害了
Just must have been one hell of an idea.

572
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,450
还是你想的
And coming from you,

573
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,400
你这样的技术专家
a tech expert such as yourself, no less.

574
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,960
这又不需要专业知识
Well, it didn't take no expertise.

575
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,020
我不过是想到现实生活中也会排队等候
I just figured you wait in line in real life,

576
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,170
不如也在网上等
might as well wait in line on the Internet.

577
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,320
西塞尔意识到
Cecil realized--

578
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,830
我们的网络爬虫太粗糙[粗鲁]
Our crawler was rude.

579
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,700
是啊  我们得调教调教它们
Yeah, we had to teach it some manners.

580
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,500
得调教调教它们
Had to teach it some manners?

581
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,080
你真会鬼扯
You are so full of shit.

582
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,030
你喝多了吧
How many of those have you had?

583
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,210
我在这城里到处是敌人
I have enemies all over this town,

584
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:44,320
你居然带来外人捣鼓我的项目
and you bring someone in to poke around my project.

585
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,060
你说什么呢
What did -- What the hell are you talking about?

586
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,260
你就没想过
Did it not even occur to you

587
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,840
或许有人会想伤害我吗
that maybe someone out there is trying to hurt me?

588
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,100
-看来你是心里有愧  -得了
- Sounds like you're nursing a guilty conscience. - Oh, please!

589
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,810
别把矛头调过来对着我
Don't go trying to turn this around on me.

590
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:53,940
你根本没理由认为
I think there's a reason why

591
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,120
-我是想坑你  -你太鲁莽了
- you think I'm trying to screw you... - You were being reckless!

592
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,370
你现在就这样
...is that's all you know how to do.

593
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,200
天呐  我都不认识你了  唐娜
God damn it, I don't even know who you are anymore, Donna!

594
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,080
我是本来会开了你的人
I'm the woman who would have fired your ass

595
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,030
只不过是顾忌黛安
if you didn't have Diane's skirt to hide behind.

596
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,060
你这些年还不是仰仗她的照顾
Well, shit, you've been hiding behind her skirt for years.

597
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,650
-多少年了  -我帮了你个忙
- Years! - I did you a favor.

598
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,070
我当初之所以让你加入
The only reason I brought you on in the first place

599
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,440
就是因为她担心你无聊
was because she was worried you were bored!

600
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,560
博斯  博斯
Bos? Bos?

601
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,340
约翰  约翰
John! John!

602
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,870
约翰
John!

603
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,810
叫救护车
Get some help!

604
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,860
约翰  天呐  约翰
John! Oh, my God. John!

605
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,920
看着我  约翰  撑住
Look at me! John, stay with me.

606
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,770
博斯沃思太太
Mrs. Bosworth?

607
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,520
博斯沃思太太
Mrs. Bosworth?

608
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,620
其实我...算了
Actually, I... Never mind.

609
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,010
他不会有事的
He's gonna be okay.

610
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,170
好吗  跟我来
All right? Come with me.

611
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,950
他怎么样了
How is he?

612
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,690
他...稳定了
Oh, he's -- he's stable.

613
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,850
好吧
Okay.

614
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,340
他们要做...
They were doing a...

615
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,890
我忘记叫什么了
I forget what it's called.

616
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,900
就是检查堵塞
It's to check for blockages.

617
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:13,380
黛安正跟医生在一起  肯定会知道更多情况
Diane's with the doctor now. I'm sure there's more news.

618
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,450
罗伯茨医生  四号线
Dr. Roberts, line four.

619
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,220
罗伯茨医生  四号线
Dr. Roberts, pick up four.

620
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,030
怎么回事
What happened?

621
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,420
我也不清楚
I'm -- I'm not sure.

622
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,410
我们在一起吃饭  他本来好好的
We were at dinner, and he was fine.

623
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:37,000
突然就...不好了
And...then he wasn't.

624
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,230
我们今天吵了一架
We had a fight today.

625
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,850
我很过分
I was mean.

626
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,660
你不能责怪自己
Well, you -- you can't blame yourself.

627
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,450
你们吵什么了
What was the fight about?

628
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,660
是你啊
So it was you.

629
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,550
他不会有事的
He's gonna be all right.

630
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,120
他是个坚强的家伙
He's a tough son of a bitch.

631
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,640
黛安跟医生在一起呢
Diane's with the doctors now.

632
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,270
她在了解情况
She's getting an update.

633
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,300
你没事吧
You okay?

634
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,890
我不知道你在干什么
I don't know what you're doing,

635
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,570
但别插手我的生意  和我的生活
but stay out of my business, and stay out of my life.

636
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,340
-天呐  我超爱她  -是吧
- Oh, my God. I love her! - Right?!

637
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,420
天啊
Oh, God!

638
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,740
她好酷
She's so bad!

639
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,330
你想听吗
You want to listen?

640
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,350
不了  谢谢
No. No, I'm fine.

641
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,910
丫头  你没事吧
Yo, punk, you okay?

642
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,870
我没事
Yeah, I'm fine.

643
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,830
博斯不会有事的
Bos is gonna be all right.

644
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,110
我就是累了
I'm just tired.

645
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,600
我能借走这个吗
Can I borrow this?

646
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,700
当然
Sure.

647
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,600
海莉
Haley.

648
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,470
你要走吗
You headed out?

649
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,370
你在听什么
What you listening to?

650
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,750
没什么
Oh, nothing.

651
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,390
流行乐吗
Show tunes?

652
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,320
是啊  《皮平》
Yeah. "Pippin."

653
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,430
别逗了
Really, though.

654
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,200
压力会使我的症状恶化
Stress exacerbates my symptoms, so, um...

655
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,990
这能让我冷静下来
this calms me down.

656
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,430
那是恩雅咯
Enya, then.

657
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:22,730
不是
No.

658
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:23,780
是
It's uh...

659
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,080
是我
It's me.

660
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:30,120
我录下了自己说话
I recorded myself just talking,

661
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,810
提醒自己事情没那么糟
reminding myself that things aren't so bad.

662
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,010
那很美
That's beautiful.

663
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,160
我们都该那么做
We should all do that.

664
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,760
我能问你个问题吗
Can I ask you something?

665
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:41,470
说吧
Yeah, no, absolutely.

666
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,900
你的日记有规律吗
Is there a pattern in your journals?

667
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,450
几年前
You know, a few years back,

668
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:52,740
我对此很着迷
I-I got, you know, really nuts about it,

669
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,100
每周末都会把一切
and I put everything into a spreadsheet

670
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,590
制成电子表
at the end of each week.

671
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,270
然后我找朋友  盖博  建了个
Then I had my friend, Gabe -- he built out

672
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,970
数据分析程序
this statistical analysis program

673
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:07,690
能绘制图表  报告
that would spit out charts and graphs and reports and...

674
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,230
但是
But...

675
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,770
抱歉  很抱歉
Look, I'm really sorry

676
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,460
我今晚错过了轮滑
I missed roller derby this evening.

677
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,880
没事  下周还有的
Don't be. It'll be there next week.

678
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,820
能跟琼妮好好玩玩感觉很棒
It was nice to get some good time in with Joanie.

679
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,680
她很有趣
She's fun.

680
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,530
她真的很喜欢你  这可不简单
She really likes you, which is...something.

681
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,260
今晚谢谢你
Thanks for tonight.

682
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:39,170
我真的很感激
You know, I really appreciate it.

683
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,760
还早呢  我们可以看电影
It's still early. We can...watch a movie.

684
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,190
我真的好累
I'm really tired.

685
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,290
好吧
Okay.

686
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,940
-没事吧  -嗯
- Is that okay? - Yeah.

687
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,320
真的吗
You sure?

688
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,950
当然  明天找我
Yeah. Call me tomorrow?

689
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,050
嗯
Yeah.

690
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,500
当然
Yeah, no, of course. I'll --

691
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,230
我一早就找你
I'll call you first thing in the morning.

692
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,660
停车
Pull over.

693
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,800
怎么了
What's wrong?

694
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,910
你能不能停车
Can you just pull over?

695
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,600
求你
Please.

696
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,830
我今天见过汤姆
I saw Tom today.

697
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,300
他来这儿工作
He had some work here,

698
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,920
我得签些文件
and, uh, I had to sign something.

699
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,230
无所谓了
It doesn't matter.

700
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:02,920
但我开始想
But I started thinking...

701
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,030
我当时为什么最终把
about why I finally told him...

702
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,590
你我的事告诉了他
about you and me.

703
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,400
因为当时  我想着
'Cause at the time, I thought

704
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,510
只有那样才能挽救我们
that it was the only way to save us.

705
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:26,900
但现在
But now...

706
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:32,420
我觉得我是希望他离开我
I think I wanted him to leave.

707
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,970
是我写了那个算法
I wrote the algorithm.

708
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,920
我是为了博斯  为了帮他
I did it for Bos -- to help him.

709
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:02,640
他的储蓄都赔了
He lost all his money and

710
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,800
他还没告诉黛安
he hasn't told Diane,

711
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,200
事情很严重
and it's a big mess.

712
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,280
我心里一部分
A part of me just...

713
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,300
只想看看我是不是能做到
wanted to see if I could do it.

714
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,590
对不起
I'm sorry.

715
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,150
你为什么告诉我
Why are you telling me this?

716
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,370
因为我爱你
Because I love you.

717
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,340
好吧  继续走
Okay, keep coming.

718
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,670
天呐  我在开车
Oh, God. I'm driving. I'm driving.

719
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,740
海莉落下了她的生物书
Haley left her bio book.

720
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,430
她周末要用吗
Does she need it for the weekend?

721
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,850
你好
Hello.

722
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,120
你知道吗
Do you know?

723
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,520
我不知道  但我能让她早上再打给你吗
I don't, but can I have her call you in the morning?

724
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,760
好啊
Sure.

725
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,430
那个
It's, um --

726
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,590
彗星  对她很有好处
It's been good for her. Comet.

727
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,530
是啊
Yeah.

728
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,600
她真的长大了
She's really growing into her skin.

729
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,630
是啊  我也很欣慰
Yeah. I'm glad you see it, too.

730
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,110
她...
She's, um...

731
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,900
她在那里就是另外一个人
God, she's just such a different person there.

732
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,140
也不能那么说  她就是更...
Or not different. She's just more --

733
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,560
我懂的
Yeah, I know what you mean.

734
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,570
我...
Look, um...

735
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,270
我知道流浪者的事搞得很复杂  但是...
I know it's been complicated with Rover, but --

736
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,140
唐娜  没事的
Look. Donna, it's fine.

737
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:04,170
今晚  很让人难受
Tonight was...hard.

738
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,150
是啊
Yeah.

739
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,700
我无法想象
I can't imagine.

740
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:14,810
天呐  黛安看到他时那声音
God, the sound of Diane's voice when she saw him, it was...

741
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,520
我和他才吵了架
And he and I had been arguing.

742
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,470
我对他很过分
I was really rough on him.

743
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,220
别  别那样
Don't. Don't.

744
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,710
不  是真的  我...
No, really, I...

745
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,050
我说了很过分的话
I said some awful things.

746
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,020
唐娜  那不怪你
Donna, it's not your fault.

747
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,870
你不在场  你不知道
You weren't there. You don't know.

748
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,030
是啊  他欠了30万呢
Yeah, well, he owes 300 grand.

749
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,540
他赔了一大笔钱
Sunk a bunch of money into a bad deal

750
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,430
不敢告诉黛安
and didn't tell Diane.

751
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:48,180
他估计是因为这个才去你那儿工作的
It's probably the real reason he went to work for you.

752
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,140
他起初来找我借
You know, he came to me first asking to borrow it,

753
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,200
我拒绝了他
and I turned him down,

754
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,850
所以如果要怪谁
so, if you're assigning blame to anyone...

755
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,130
唐娜
Donna.

756
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,690
你不会有事吧
You gonna be okay?

757
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,640
当然
Sure.

758
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,930
嗯
Yes.

759
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,380
晚安  戈登
Night, Gordon.

760
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,490
晚安
Good night.

761
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:03,390

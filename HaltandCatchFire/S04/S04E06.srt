早上好
Good morning.

39
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,740
我想出来了  "去看彗星"
I got it: "Catch the Comet."

40
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,960
-不好  -为什么
- No. - Why not?

41
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,340
因为听上去好像在说流感
Because it sounds like the flu.

42
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,010
或是阴虱
Or the clap.

43
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,530
"一起彗星"怎么样
How 'bout,  "let's Comet"?

44
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,610
不如还是  算了吧
How 'bout, let's not.

45
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,670
就像棉签  纸巾  创可贴一样
It's like Q-tip, Kleenex, Band-Aid --

46
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,030
我们能成为第一个互联网品牌
We could be the first Internet brand.

47
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,430
是啊  我也很乐意做你的焦点小组
Yes, and I would love to be your focus group.

48
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,670
只不过得在10点后
Just after 10:00 A.M.

49
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,490
但流浪者正脆弱  少了一个经理...
But Rover's vulnerable, one manager down...

50
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,450
乔
Joe.

51
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,640
别这样  太邪恶了
Come on. That's a little evil.

52
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
只是个玩笑
It's a joke.

53
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,800
放松
Relax.

54
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,150
我想尽早跟你一起去看看他
Hey, I-I want us to visit him soon, okay?

55
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,680
他知道我告诉你了  他很难过
He knows I told you, and he feels bad...

56
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,120
我觉得他想道歉
I think he wants to apologize.

57
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,210
没必要
There's no need.

58
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,040
我们还是有更好的思路
We still have a better approach.

59
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,290
现在发现
And as it turns out,

60
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,280
他们的新搜索算法背后的"天才"
the "genius" behind their new search algorithm

61
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,840
他们根本不能用
is unavailable to them...

63
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,760
"搜索  查找  会心[彗星]"
"Search it, find it... com-it."

64
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,140
太完美了
It's perfect.

65
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,100
谢谢你能来
Thanks for coming in.

66
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,920
我觉得还是应该面对面
I thought it was important that we speak face to face --

67
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,330
私下聊聊
and in private.

68
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,710
流浪者的代码有90%是我写的
I wrote ninety percent of the code Rover's built on.

69
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,990
没错  它还是一家医学索引公司的时候
Yes, back when it was a medical indexing company.

70
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,790
但流浪者与时俱进
But Rover's evolved,

71
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,620
而你却还在原地踏步
and you haven't evolved with it.

72
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,410
你要我做的事我都做了
I've done everything you've asked me to do.

73
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,830
为什么还得让我走
Why am I the one that has to go?

74
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,940
博斯已经离开了
Bos has already stepped away.

75
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,350
老实说  你的价位更...
And frankly, your deal is much more --

76
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,860
是我和我的朋友一起创立了这家公司
I made this company with my friends.

77
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,380
你觉得我在乎什么离职待遇吗
Do you think I give a shit about an exit package?!

78
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,560
在你跑来  要求我们
We were fine until you came in

79
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,250
完成各种不可能的任务前  我们都好好的
and started demanding the impossible.

80
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,330
如果我之前对你太严苛  对不起
If I've been hard on you, I'm sorry.

81
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,050
但这无关公平
But this isn't about what's fair.

82
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,970
这只关乎生存
This is about survival.

83
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,150
我觉得你不在乎钱
I don't think you care about the money.

84
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,690
但我觉得你在乎你的朋友
But I do think you care about your friends.

85
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,140
事实上  因为将别人的劳动成果据为己有
The fact is, by passing someone else's work off as your own,

86
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,030
你让他们处于了危险之中
you've put them in a precarious position.

87
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,960
唯一能保护他们的办法
The only way to protect them

88
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,830
就是拆分算法
is to take the search algorithm apart

89
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,450
建立流浪者专有的搜索引擎
and build Rover's own proprietary version of it.

90
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,350
要做到这一点  你就不能插手
And for that to work, you can't be involved.

91
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,870
我知道这种  失败的感觉
I do know what it's like, to feel like a failure.

92
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,810
觉得自己没本事
To feel like you don't measure up.

93
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,030
但如果你不离开
But if you don't step aside

94
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,490
让我找其他人
and let me bring in someone else,

95
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,970
你和你朋友可能最终一无所有
you and your friends could end up with noing.

96
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,170
那我该怎么和他们说
So what do I tell them?

97
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,460
真话
The truth.

98
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,390
我累了
I'm burned out.

99
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,180
我这段时间很难熬
I've been struggling for a while now.

100
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,930
流浪者前景不错
Rover's in a good place.

101
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,310
我觉得我也应该向前看了
I feel it's time for me to move on...

102
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,200
试试吧
Try it.

103
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,940
我累了
I'm burned out.

104
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,500
我这段时间很难熬
It's been hard for a while now,

105
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,430
我觉得应该向前看了
and I think it's time to move on...

106
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,230
现在就说
Now...?

107
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,750
需要多久都行
Take all the time you need.

108
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,020
海莉
Haley!

109
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,060
快过来
Get over here!

110
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,560
怎么了  老爸
What is it, Dad?

111
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,430
有件非常重要的事情
Well, we have something really important

112
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,030
我们需要谈谈
that we need to discuss.

113
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,520
好吧
Okay.

114
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,260
我想你知道我要说什么
I think you know what I'm talking about.

115
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,510
并不知道
No. Uh...

116
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,470
火箭
Rockets!

117
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,870
不是吧
No. Way!

118
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,030
-生日快乐  亲爱的  -今天下午就去吧
- Happy birthday, Bug. - Let's go this afternoon!

119
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,070
慢着  今天不行
Well, slow down. We can't.

120
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,670
我们还得把网站重新归类  而且大家
We still have to recategorize the site, and everyone's --

121
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,190
可是天气多好啊  能见度这么高
But the weather's perfect, visibility's awesome!

122
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,900
-海莉别闹  -而且今天真是我的生日
- Haley, come on. - And today's my actual birthday.

123
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,450
可是如果周六去的话  还能邀请你朋友来
Yeah, but if we go Saturday, we can invite your friends.

124
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,840
我现在就问他们
I'll ask them right now.

125
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,270
不  你在学校的朋友
No, your school friends, okay?

126
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,190
他们还得工作  再说了  这是你生日
They have to work. Besides, it's your birthday.

127
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,790
又不是全国假期
It's not a national holiday.

128
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,060
好吧  那邀请凯蒂去行吗
Okay, well, what about inviting Katie?

129
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,890
真的
Really?

130
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,780
是啊  求你了  去吧  就咱们几个
Yeah, c'mon, let's do it. Just us.

131
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,800
我看看能不能联系上卡梅
Let me see if I can reach Cam.

132
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,100
我问问她能不能腾出点时间来
I'll check to see if she can move up the day.

133
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,150
你最棒了
You're the best!

134
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,800
还没完全确定哟
It's not 100%!

135
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,500
真不像是西塞尔会做的事
This is just so unlike Cecil.

136
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,250
这种人员调整是难免的事
Look, shake-ups like this happen.

137
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,030
在我看来  这事无论是对你们
As far as I'm concerned, it's no refection on you

138
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,140
还是对流浪者的长期发展都没有影响
or on the long-term viability of Rover.

139
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,070
但这难道不会引发议论吗
But this will raise eyebrows, won't it?

140
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,060
一个创始人
I-I mean, for a cofounder

141
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,920
在公司势头正好的时候退出
to leave when the company's doing so well --

142
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,670
相信我  大家唯一关心的事
Trust me, the only thing anyone cares about

143
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,130
就是我们有多少流量
is how much traffic we're getting.

144
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,890
而在这个方面  谭雅说得对
And in that respect, Tanya's right.

145
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,230
我们真的势头很好
We're doing really well.

146
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,870
而且有了首轮融资  我们就有机会
And with the Series A, we have the opportunity

147
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,990
吸引更厉害的优秀人才
to attract some formidable talent.

148
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,790
我要你们把精力放在优化网站上
I want you guys to focus on optimizing the site.

149
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,230
而我来主持人才引进的事
And I'll take lead on hiring

150
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,540
确保我们能把硅谷最优秀的首席技术官请来
and make sure we land the best CTO in the Valley.

151
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,710
现在还有能人闲着吗
Is anyone good even available?

152
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,230
有啊  博比·阿伦
Yeah, Bobby Aron is.

153
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,490
博比·阿伦
Bobby Aron?

154
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,790
你开玩笑吗
Are you kidding?

155
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,360
这个人  是个传说
That guy's a -- a legend.

156
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,590
微软花了大工夫想请他去
Microsoft's making a huge play for him.

157
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,270
我真的觉得
I really don't think --

158
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,530
听我说
Listen to me.

159
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,530
我们业内领先
We're the big ones.

160
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,850
任何人能来我们这里当技术官  是他命好
Any CTO would be lucky to be with us.

161
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,390
从现在起就要拿出领头羊的架子来  明白吗
That's how we operate from now on. Got it?

162
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,680
-好吧  -好
- All right. - Yep.

163
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,440
明白
Got it.

164
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:00,700
好的
Okay.

165
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,600
看起来如何
How's it look?

166
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,020
挺不错  戈大胖
Nice. El Gordo!

167
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,840
是啊
Yeah.

168
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,900
你知道是什么意思吧
You know what it means, right?

169
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,520
知道  "大帅哥"
Yeah. "Handsome."

170
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,620
没错
Exactly.

171
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,540
你看这个
Hey, you see that?

172
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,770
是海莉画的
Haley drew it.

173
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,710
水手每航行五千英里就文上一个
Sailors get one tattooed for every 5,000 miles.

174
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,000
但你知道她说什么吗
But you know what she said?

175
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,250
因为这火箭是实物缩小一百倍
Since the rocket's 1/100th in scale,

176
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,850
它只要飞五十英里就行
it only needs to cover fifty.

177
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,000
你的还没发射呢  所以
Well, you haven't launched yours yet, so...

178
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,160
你真觉得我不能
What, do you honestly think I'm not gonna launch

179
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,690
让它飞五十英里远
that thing 50 miles?

180
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,330
好吧
Fair enough.

181
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,970
别担心  亲爱的
No, don't worry, hon.

182
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,450
你觉得她不想邀请
Do you think it's weird

183
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,950
她学校里的朋友是不是很奇怪
that she didn't want to invite any of her school friends?

184
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:47,790
不
No.

185
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,100
学校朋友没那么重要
School friends are overrated.

186
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,140
她看上去很开心
She seems really happy.

187
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,060
而且凯蒂很棒
And Katie is great.

188
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,760
我觉得它少了点什么
I feel like it's missing something...

189
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,690
你是准备发射进入地球轨道吗
Oh, you're planning on going orbital?

190
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,040
这个一定要进入外逸层
Definitely exosphere on this one.

191
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,410
你们经常玩这个吗
You guys do this a lot?

192
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,320
对  我们以前一直玩
Yeah, we used to go all the time

193
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,110
直到我妈炸伤了手
until my mom blew her hand off.

194
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,390
我们当时都没看到它飞过来
It's just... We didn't even see it coming.

195
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,230
-你知道吗  -你太逗了
- You know? - You are hilarious.

196
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,470
在我几乎许诺给你的邻居一个肾之后
So then, after I practically promised her a kidney,

197
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,930
她让她可怜的儿子跑了十英里
your neighbor makes her poor son run ten miles...

198
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:24,660
一  一英里
One. One mile. ...

199
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,990
就为了去敲你的门给你传消息
just to come and knock on your door and give you a message?

200
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,630
那又怎样  我又不是之后没载他回家
So? It's not like I didn't give him a ride home afterwards.

201
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,060
你知道  电话19世纪就发明出来了
Phones were invented in the 19th century, you know,

202
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,040
当时美国还几乎都是农村
when America was still mostly agrarian.

203
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,620
你可以自己做一个
I mean, you could build your own.

204
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,790
事实上  你应该做一个
In fact, you should.

205
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,700
你太闲的时候
You're a lot of trouble

206
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,320
就是个大麻烦
when you've got too much time on your hands.

207
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,680
我告诉你了  我为了博斯才那么做的
I told you, I did that to help Bos.

208
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,910
他也找我帮忙了
He asked me for help, too,

209
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,870
但我没直接给他写个算法
but I didn't go out and write him an algorithm.

210
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,820
好吧  别担心
Okay, well, don't worry,

211
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,150
我不干了
I'm done.

212
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,820
我厌倦了科技  这所有的一切
I'm sick of tech. The whole thing.

213
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,130
你怎么了  才32就江郎才尽了
What are you, washed up at 32?

214
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,800
别这样  你就得了一个差评啊
Come on. You got one lousy review.

215
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,670
你知不知道大家都是怎么说交响乐的
And do you have any idea what people said about the Symphonic?

216
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,310
我可了解你
Come on, I know you.

217
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,780
你的梦都是代码
You dream in code.

218
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,550
是啊
Yeah.

219
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,210
但现在不是了
Not anymore.

220
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,740
你们快来
Hey, guys!

221
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,570
-快来  -我们准备好了
- Guys, guys. - We're ready!

222
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,310
快来
Come on.

223
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,130
-好  插钥匙  -插了
- All right, get your keys in. - Key's in.

224
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,500
你可以给我录像吗
Would you -- Would you film me?

225
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,940
生日快乐  亲爱的
Happy birthday, Bug.

226
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,770
倒数五下
And T-minus five...

227
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,860
四
Four...

228
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,710
三  二  一
three, two, one...

229
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,370
发射
Blast off!

230
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,000
轰隆
Boom.

231
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,560
它飞去哪了
Where'd it go?

232
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,880
它去哪了
Where is it?!

233
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,080
我应该拦住它的
I'm supposed to stop it!

234
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,090
这是什么  用来自杀的音乐吗
What is this, music to kill yourself by?

235
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,920
你可以给我拿瓶啤酒吗
Hey, would you mind bringing me a beer?

236
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,530
如果你想也可以来一瓶
You can have one too, if you want.

237
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,300
别告诉你爸
Don't tell your dad.

238
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,730
博斯如何了
So how's Bos?

239
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,980
还行吧
Good, I think.

240
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,680
你第一次尝啤酒是什么感觉
And how's your first sip of beer?

241
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,260
很难喝
It's awful.

242
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,680
不过他没事了吧  他昨天就出院了吧
But he's good, right? They released him yesterday?

243
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,190
你怎么知道的
How do you know?

244
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,140
我周五放学后去看他了
I saw him Friday, after school.

245
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,000
我以为医院探视时间是早上
I thought visiting hours at the hospital were in the morning.

246
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,690
我跟他们说我是他的孙女
I told them I was his granddaughter.

247
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,250
我爱死你这一点了
I love that about you.

248
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,590
你知道的  对吗
You know that, right?

249
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,750
你真的特别无畏
You're absolutely fearless.

250
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,150
那是医院
It's a hospital.

251
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,990
他们又不会逮捕我
They're not gonna arrest me.

252
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,550
真不知道你像谁
Well, I don't know where you get it.

253
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,370
你从来没闯过祸吗
You never got in any trouble?

254
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,120
做过什么疯狂的事
Do anything crazy?

255
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,360
我这人很谨慎...
I was pretty cautious...

256
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,760
得了吧
C'mon.

257
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,650
说说嘛
C'mon.

258
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,290
你爸和我以前经常去野营
Well... your dad and I used to go camping all the time,

259
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,910
有一次我们到了一个营地
and we went to this one campsite.

260
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,010
那里的当地人总是说起他们会去的一个采石场
And the locals always talked about this quarry they'd go to.

261
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:48,950
那里有个天然泳池
It was a swimming hole.

262
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,820
所以你爸和我开车去找到了那个天然泳池
So your dad and I drove out there, and we found it.

263
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,910
那里非常美
It was incredible.

264
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,820
我们站在一个悬崖上俯瞰着底下  
It was this cliff overlooking

265
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,080
最最清澈  透亮  湛蓝的池水
the glassiest, clearest blue water you've ever seen.

266
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,750
你爸爸不敢跳下去
And your dad wouldn't jump in.

267
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,570
他不敢  太高了
He wouldn't. It was too high.

268
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,240
所以我嘲笑他
So I laughed at him,

269
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,070
他说  "我赌你也不敢"
and he said, "I bet you won't, either."

270
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,780
于是我不假思索地冲到悬崖边
So before I could think twice, I ran right up to the edge,

271
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,510
一个空翻跳了下去
did a cartwheel right off.

272
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,430
我的天呐  妈
Holy shit, Mom,

273
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,830
我能生下来都算是个奇迹了
it's a miracle that I was even born.

274
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,780
我猜我当时就是不相信
I guess I just didn't believe

275
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,800
我会受伤  知道吗
that I could really get hurt, you know?

276
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,290
我就是感觉很自由
It just felt...free.

277
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,980
你的心也很自由
You have that,

278
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,530
我希望你永远别变
and I don't ever want you to lose it.

279
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,200
永远别因为害怕就畏缩不前
Don't ever stop yourself 'cause you're scared...

280
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:36,830
好吧
Okay.

281
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:43,220
那下次我闯了祸  你要记住
Well, next time I get in trouble, remember:

282
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,690
那是因为我勇敢
It's 'cause I'm being "brave."

283
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,010
好吧
All right.

284
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,380
我要去写作业了
I got to do my homework, so...

285
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,910
好
All right.

286
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,650
晚安
G'night.

287
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:57,910
晚安
G'night.

288
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,040
这真不可思议  不是吗
It's amazing, isn't it?

289
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,010
前一刻  海莉才四岁
One minute, Haley's four

290
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,050
用沙发垫盖了一个堡垒
and building a fort out of the sofa cushions.

291
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,150
下一刻  她就已经...
The next minute, she's...

292
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,930
我在捏爆你的头
I'm crushing your head.

293
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,720
说着《少年监狱》中的笑话
...telling "Kids in the Hall" jokes.

294
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,720
真是太酷了
It's just...so cool.

295
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,090
是啊  小孩都很可爱
Oh, yeah, kids are great --

296
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,350
如果你能直接生出个14岁的孩子
if you can give birth to a fourteen-year-old.

297
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,450
晚上见
I will see you tonight.

298
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,200
再见
Bye.

299
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,640
这是什么...
What the hell...?

300
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,490
好了  放松
All right, just relax.

301
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,240
清空思绪
Clear your mind.

302
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,120
怂包
Coward.

303
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,300
说到"互联网"
Okay, uh, the first thing that I think of

304
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,680
我首先想到的是...
when I hear "Internet" is...

305
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,320
电脑
A computer?

306
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,410
电脑
A computer.

307
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,480
-还有毛片  -毛片
- And porn. - Porn.

308
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,900
-毛片  -一堆毛片
- Porn? - Lots of porn.

309
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,020
我想加入给毛片分类的团队
I put in a request to be on the team that catalogues porn.

310
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,850
哔  哔  哔
Beep, beep, beep...

311
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,320
戈登·克拉克
Gordon Clark.

312
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,480
是我
Hey, it's me.

313
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,660
抱歉通知得这么晚
I'm sorry this is so last second,

314
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,280
但晚饭能改期吗
but can we reschedule dinner?

315
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,540
没问题
Yeah, no problem.

316
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,900
反正也没有什么要报告的
N-Nothing to report anyway.

317
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,130
其实有
Well, actually, there is.

318
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,690
海莉的辅导老师打电话给我了
I got a phone call from Haley's guidance counselor.

319
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,480
她历史和生物都要挂科了
She's flunking history and bio.

320
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,880
我们的女儿海莉吗
Our Haley?

321
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,440
是  她有些作业没交
Yeah, she hasn't turned in some assignments,

322
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,530
最近几次考试也都挂了
and apparently she bombed the last couple tests...

323
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,880
我不明白  她成绩那么好
I don't get it, she was doing so great...

324
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,880
可能她就是分身乏术
Well, maybe she's just trying to do too much.

325
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,190
别这样  唐娜  她那么喜欢彗星
Come on, Donna. She loves Comet.

326
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,950
我知道她很喜欢  但我觉得她该缓缓
I know she loves it, but I think she needs a break.

327
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,700
我担心她把工作放在首位了
I'm afraid she's putting work above everything else.

328
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,590
也不知道是跟谁学的
Well, I wonder where she gets that from.

329
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,740
你在开玩笑吧  我总是把孩子放在工作前面
Excuse me. I always put the girls before work.

330
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,350
如果你想让我去和海莉谈
And if you need me to talk to Haley

331
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,740
因为你自己搞不定  那...
because you can't handle it, then --

332
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,670
我很抱歉  好吗
I-I -- I'm sorry, all right?

333
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,720
我只是...
I just...

334
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,660
我不想唱黑脸
I don't want to be the bad guy here.

335
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,850
你以为我想吗
And I do?

336
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,640
好吧  我会和她谈的
Okay, I'll talk to her.

337
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,390
谢谢  戈登
Thank you, Gordon.

338
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,640
怎么了
Whassup?

339
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,470
这地方不错
Uh, it's a nice place.

340
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,130
-很有趣  -感谢你停车  我都饿坏了
- It's...charming. - Yeah, thanks for stopping. I was staved.

341
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,470
你最喜欢的网站是什么
So...favorite site?

342
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,090
天哪  没法选  太难选了
God, I can't pick just one -- That's too hard!

343
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,330
其他人都选什么
What did everyone else say?

344
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,660
有个人最喜欢的网站
Well, one person's favorite site

345
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,080
是全紫的屏幕
was a purple screen.

346
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,880
就那么简单  紫屏
Just that -- a purple screen.

347
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,670
是梅莉莎吧
Melissa, right?

348
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,180
她沉迷于此
She's obsessed.

349
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,400
还有人推荐了
And someone else recommended

350
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,260
"草莓馅饼喷灯"
"Strawberry Pop Tart Blowtorches."

351
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,120
对  是阿尼发现的
Oh, yeah, Arnie found that one!

352
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,800
我们一整天都在给馅饼点火
We spent an entire day setting Pop-Tarts on fire.

353
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,250
我们大概弄坏了三个烤面包机
I think we destroyed like three toasters.

354
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,360
真厉害
That's impressive.

355
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,810
但我不知道这些东西
But I'm not sure how any of these

356
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,050
怎么吸引普通人
are gonna get the average person online.

357
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,780
为什么不能呢  我就是这样开始上网的
Why not? They got me online.

358
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,910
怎么会
How so?

359
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,650
我刚开始浏览互联网的时候
Well, when I first looked at the Internet --

360
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,500
还记得你的便条吗
Remember your Post-its? --

361
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,900
我那时觉得很无聊
I thought it was pretty boring.

362
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,930
就是一堆数据库和文档
It was nothing but databases and archives...

363
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,990
但后来我就发现了一些其他的东西
But then I found all this other stuff --

364
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,670
比如有个孩子  贾斯汀  会写生活日记
like this kid, Justin, who's writing about his life.

365
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,700
还有一个女孩
And this other girl

366
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,580
痴迷于《我爱露西》...
who was obsessed with "I Love Lucy"...

367
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,400
这些东西吸引人的地方在哪里
And what about that was so appealing?

368
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,400
我也不知道
I don't know.

369
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,830
上学很没劲
School was not good.

370
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,170
倒不是有人欺负我什么的
I mean, no one was torturing me or anything like that,

371
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,110
只是  大家都在装
but it's just, like, everyone's always pretending,

372
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,310
懂吗
you know?

373
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,630
所以互联网才很棒  因为没人假装
That's why the Web's so great, 'cause no one pretends.

374
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,210
你会展现真实的自己
You just put it out there, who you really are.

375
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,140
如果有人回应  那很好
And if people respond to it, that's great.

376
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,160
但即使没有  又如何
But if not, who cares?

377
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,420
至少他们看到的是你
At least they saw you

378
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,180
不是一个投影
and not just some projection, you know?

379
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:18,820
嗯
Yeah.

380
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,030
你们在工作吗
You guys working?

381
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,760
是啊  你好  凡妮莎
Yeah. Hi, Vanessa.

382
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,020
这是我老板  乔·麦克米伦
This is my boss, Joe MacMillan.

383
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,660
其实  是联合创始人
Actually, cofounder.

384
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,290
厉害
Cool.

385
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,880
我超级喜欢互联网地下音乐档案
I'm totally addicted to IUMA, by the way.

386
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,930
他们的独立摇滚版块  太棒了
Their indie rock section's, like, incredible --

387
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,060
是啊  谁还需要地下流行乐
I know. It's like who needs Sub Pop?

388
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,920
你找到冰薄荷酒的那版编曲了吗
Did you find that Julep compilation?

389
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,140
就是混音了幼童车歌曲的那个
The one with the Bratmobile song?

390
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,180
嗯
Yes!

391
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,300
我们谈谈...
"Let's talk about...

392
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,680
-狗吧  -狗
- dogs." - Dogs.

393
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,060
-是啊  -是啊
- Yeah. -Yeah.

394
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,700
贝茜天堂的歌也太酷了
The Heavens to Betsy song's, like, hella cool, too.

395
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,710
是啊
Yeah.

396
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,630
我得回去上班了  但回见了
I better get back to work, but I'll see you later.

397
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,090
好啊
Yeah. For sure.

398
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:01,880
好
Cool.

399
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,620
她挺不错
She seems cool.

400
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,990
我们刚刚说什么来着
What were we talking about again?

401
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,400
在互联网上
So on the Internet...

402
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,640
你觉得你可以做真实的自己
you think you can be who you really are?

403
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,600
流浪者不仅能计算用户数量
With Rover we cannot only count the number of users,

404
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,900
还能追踪他们的浏览和浏览时间
we can track what they click on, how long they look at it --

405
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,720
这是广告人的美梦
I mean, it's an advertiser's dream.

406
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,840
那么是推销咯
So, it is about selling.

407
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,870
不...
No, it's

408
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,110
重点是改变
It's about change.

409
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,460
在流浪者  你可以加入
At Rover, you could be part

410
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,420
一个全球化的分散的平台
of a universal, decentralized platform

411
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,590
而且它已经在改变世界了
that's already changing the world.

412
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,640
你可以加入微软
Look. You could join Microsoft

413
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,320
让他们来给你定义未来
and let them tell you what the future will be.

414
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,970
你也可以加入我们  自己定义未来
Or you could join us and tell them.

415
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,740
我今早已经接受微软的邀约了
I accepted the Microsoft offer this morning.

416
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,660
我没有推掉会面是因为  我小时候
I only kept this meeting because, well, growing up,

417
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,490
是穆特尼的大粉丝
I was a huge fan of Mutiny --

418
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,460
准确说是社区
really Community.

419
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,550
我结交了朋友
I-I made friends,

420
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,180
还交易了商品
and I traded bootlegs

421
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,660
买卖电脑部件
and bought and sold computer parts.

422
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,780
那挽救了我  真的
It was a lifesaver, really.

423
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,430
我
And I, uh...

424
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,170
我猜我就是想谢谢你
Well, I guess I just wanted to thank you.

425
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,880
我很高兴
That's really nice to hear, but I

426
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,100
但我真心希望能成的
I was really hoping this would work out.

427
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,010
我能问你个问题吗
Can I ask you a question?

428
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,350
社区是那么超前于时代
Community was so far ahead of its time.

429
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,500
你为什么一直没试着重建它
Why haven't you tried to re-create it?

430
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,650
穆特尼是我最快乐的时光
Mutiny was the most fun I ever had.

431
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,190
我们当时就是毫无章法
We didn't know what we were doing.

432
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,170
一个个地解决危机
It was one crisis after another.

433
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:58,890
但它成功了
But it worked.

434
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,910
它后来的失败
The failure of that was...

435
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,190
怎么说的来着
Well, what's that saying --

436
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,520
断掉的地方会长得更结实
You grow stronger at the broken places...?

437
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:12,960
不说了
Anyway.

438
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,540
事实上
Yeah, the truth is,

439
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,090
我是想再建立一版社区
I am trying to build another version of Community.

440
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,390
但这次是整个互联网了
Except, this time, it's the entire Internet.

441
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,590
是所有人
It's everyone.

442
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,720
这就是流浪者最了不起的地方
That's what's so exciting about Rover.

443
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,320
它不设保护地
It's flying without a net

444
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,340
飞入了未知
into the great unknown.

445
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,640
很吓人  也很令人兴奋
It's terrifying, and it's exhilarating.

446
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,880
好吧
Well...

447
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,150
我以前也是改过主意的
I have been known to change my mind, though.

448
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,310
嗯
Yeah.

449
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,870
微软很安全
Microsoft's safe.

450
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,100
但是  怎么说的来着
But, um, well, what's that saying?

451
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,950
没有危险  就没有奖赏嘛
No risk, no reward, right?

452
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,710
我加入
I'm in.

453
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,210
如果你还想要我的话
If you still want me, that is.

454
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,040
当然了
I-I -- Y-- Absolutely!

455
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,620
那好
Okay, okay.

456
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,760
我可能需要你凌厉的一面帮忙
I might need your shark side to help me out, though.

457
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,150
微软可绝不会喜欢这样的
The Beast of Redmond ain't gonna like this one bit.

458
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,560
我才不怕他们
They don't scare me.

459
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,870
是啊  我猜你谁都不怕
Yeah, I can't imagine who would.

460
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,340
敬危险
To risk.

461
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,780
你想再来吗
You up for one more?

462
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,720
你好
Hello.

463
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,620
你还好吗
Feeling okay...?

464
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,760
嗯
Yeah.

465
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,790
有咖啡
There's coffee...

466
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,390
我该...走了
I should, uh -- I should get going.

467
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,680
我们该...
Yeah, we should, um...

468
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,850
谈谈工作的事
We should talk about the job --

469
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:23,600
其实
You know...

470
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:25,960
算了
it's fine.

471
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,780
嗯
Yeah.

472
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,790
好吧
O-Okay.

473
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,950
约翰
John?

474
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,680
是萨姆寄来的
It's from Sam.

475
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,370
那个头发浓密的是我
That's me with all the hair.

476
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,160
真是个好孩子
What a kid.

477
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,950
约翰  这整件事
John, this whole experience...

478
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,860
让我开始思考
it's been making me think.

479
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,850
在医院  情况很糟
At the hospital, it was so hard.

480
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,400
我根本无权决定你的治疗
I had no say in your care

481
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,660
要是真出了事
and if something had gone wrong...

482
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,050
但没事嘛
Yeah, but it didn't.

483
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,870
我没事
I'm fine...

484
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,150
不仅是这个
Well, it's not just that.

485
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,410
在餐厅  有那么一刻
At the restaurant, there was a moment...

486
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,740
你的样子
the way you looked.

487
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,990
我以为自己要失去你了
I thought I was losing you.

488
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,780
我爱你
I love you.

489
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,910
我不知道我们还剩多少时间能在一起
And I don't know how much time together we have left.

490
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,330
那我们还等什么
So what're we waiting for?

491
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,830
我没有戒指
Now, I don't have a ring --

492
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,080
我知道你想要颗大钻石
And I know you're expecting a big rock...

493
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,570
女人啊  你要我的心怎么承受得来
Goddamn, woman, what're you doing to my heart?

494
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,180
怎么样
So...?

495
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,920
记得帕特森房屋开发吗
Do you remember the Patterson housing development?

496
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,230
你没参加
You passed on it.

497
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,650
但我觉得还是值得考虑的
I thought it was worth a second look.

498
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,320
赔了多少
How much?

499
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,860
30万
300k.

500
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,000
我想自己解决
I wanted to take care of it myself.

501
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,340
我不希望你知道我多傻
I didn't want you to know what a fool I was --

502
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,680
我以为去流浪者工作能双赢
I thought workin' at Rover would be a win-win,

503
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:33,170
结果  我们遇上了障碍  我慌了
and then we started hitting a wall, and I panicked.

504
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,350
你看到之前的网站了  根本不够好
You saw the site. It wasn't good enough.

505
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,820
我们跳不过那个障碍
We couldn't get over that hump.

506
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:44,480
所以我去找卡梅帮忙建了搜索引擎
So I-I got Cam to help build the search engine.

507
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,220
唐娜发现了
And Donna found out,

508
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:49,170
在餐厅时  她知道...
and then at restaurant, she knew that she --

509
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,740
对不起
I'm sorry.

510
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,210
黛安
Diane.

511
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,550
黛安
Diane!

512
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,420
海莉  过来
Haley? C'mere.

513
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,410
怎么了  皮特还在等着送我回学校
What is it? Pete's waiting to take me back to school.

514
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,490
我们得谈谈你的成绩
We need to talk about your grades.

515
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,030
好吧
Okay...

516
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,630
学校来电话了
The school called.

517
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,360
-说你挂了两科  -挂科
- They said that you're failing two classes. - Failing?

518
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,420
我可能是错过了几次测试  但我还可以重考
I -- Maybe I missed a few tests, but I can just retake them.

519
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,630
-这个嘛  -我可以去找我的老师谈
- Well... - I'll talk to my teacher. I can...

520
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,540
我们说好  你在这里工作
We agreed that you could work here

521
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,580
前提是能保持成绩
if you kept up your grades.

522
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,960
那是我们说好的
That was the deal.

523
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,890
你什么意思  我得停止工作吗
S-So what're you saying? I have to stop working?

524
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,550
暂时的  直到你恢复成绩
Just temporarily until you can bring your grades back up,

525
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,830
到时可以再考虑
and then we can talk --

526
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,530
但是  爸爸  这是海莉的彗星
But, Dad -- It's Haley's Comet!

527
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,520
要不是我  你根本没有这间公司
You wouldn't even have a company if weren't for me!

528
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,070
听着  冷静点  亲爱的
Hey, listen. Calm down, Bug.

529
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,140
-并不完全是这样的  -别再喊我"亲爱的"了
- That's not entirely accurate. - Stop calling me "Bug"!

530
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,400
我还何必去上学
And why do I even need school?

531
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,720
我已经有工作了
I already have a job.

532
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,830
因为你需要去上学学习
Because you need school to learn

533
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,230
-结交朋友  -我的朋友都在这里
- and to make friends - My friends are here --

534
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,810
你不能解雇我  他们需要我
And you can't fire me, they need me!

535
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:11,030
好吧  我觉得我们还是能撑住的
Okay, well, I think we'd be able to manage --

536
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,510
海莉  去收拾
Haley, clean it up.

537
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,860
-不  -海莉  如果你还想回来工作
- No. - Haley, if you ever want to work here again,

538
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,680
你就去给我收拾
you will clean. It. Up.

539
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,570
海莉
Haley!

540
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,370
海...
Ha--

541
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,140
给我回来
Get back here!

542
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,700
海莉
Haley!

543
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,180
看什么
What?!

544
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,810
是啊  红皮钱包
Yes, it's a red leather wallet.

545
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,270
我当时坐在吧台
I was siting at the bar...

546
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,330
是吗
You do?

547
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,450
我今晚去拿  谢谢
I-I will come by tonight. Thank you.

548
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,840
有时间吗
Do you have a moment?

549
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,120
怎么了
What's going on...?

550
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,420
我跟约翰谈了
I had a talk with John.

551
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,010
显然  他做了些跟流浪者有关的
And apparently he's made some bad decisions

552
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,370
错误决定
regarding Rover.

553
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,710
但我想你已经知道了
But I think you already know that.

554
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,280
我是有所怀疑
Well, I had my suspicions,

555
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,750
但我并不确定  直到我看见了卡梅
but I didn't know for sure until I saw Cam...

556
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,600
都结束了
It's done.

557
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,150
重要的是
Now, the important thing

558
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,580
解决麻烦  继续向前
is to clean up the mess and move on.

559
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,570
我非常同意  西塞尔已经走了
I couldn't agree more. Cecil is gone.

560
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,480
我们打算找一个人
We plan to find someone

561
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,330
来逆向工程流浪者的代码
who can reverse engineer Rover's code --

562
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,600
逆向工程  为什么
Reverse engineer? Why?

563
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,530
避免网站承担法律责任
Oh, to protect the site from any liabilities --

564
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,720
但如果是卡梅伦写了代码
But if Cameron built this code,

565
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,470
接下来  唯一的办法
the next step -- the only step --

566
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,010
就是让她签转让书
is to get her to sign a release.

567
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,200
只有这样才能保护网站
That's how we protect the site.

568
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,620
是啊
Yes, yes.

569
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,780
但在这件事上
But in this one case,

570
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,750
我真心认为这不是合适的办法
I really think that is the wrong move.

571
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,500
何必让卡梅伦知道
I mean, why let Cameron know

572
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,410
她给我们的东西多宝贵
how valuable what she gave us was?

573
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,820
最好还是创造我们自己版本的算法
I mean, better to just create our own version of the algorithm,

574
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,160
反正也没人会知道
and no one will be any wiser.

575
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,730
这毫无道理
That doesn't make any sense.

576
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,650
现在有个简单的办法
Look, there is one simple solution,

577
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,120
而且早该去做了
and it should've happened immediately:

578
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,930
付给卡梅伦她索要的费用  然后了事
pay Cameron whatever she wants and be done with it.

579
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,120
不行  我做不到
No! I can't. I can't.

580
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,530
我就是
I-I just...

581
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,830
做不到
I-I can't.

582
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,280
接下来要这么办
Well, this is what's gonna happen.

583
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,190
你要去找卡梅伦
You're going to go to Cameron

584
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,650
让她签转让书
and get her to sign a release.

585
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,220
然后你要让位
And then you will step away.

586
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,900
让崔普接手
And Trip will take over.

587
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,570
我...
Th-- I...

588
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,730
这不公平
That's not fair.

589
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,760
他...你了解他的
He'll just -- He'll -- You know him.

590
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,500
-他会利用这机会  -成为执行合伙人吗
- He'll use it! - To become managing partner?

591
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,740
或许吧
Perhaps.

592
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,100
或许这样最好
Maybe that's best.

593
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,720
老实说  你有更严重的问题
Frankly, you have bigger issues to deal with.

594
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,800
自己振作点吧  唐娜
Get yourself together, Donna.

595
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,420
我不想再照顾着你了
I'm tired of holding your hand.

596
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,600
这一切都是因为
None of this would've happened

597
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,320
博斯觉得没法跟你说实话
if Bos felt like he could just come and talk to you.

598
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,220
我收到你邮件时很意外
I was surprised to get your e-mail.

599
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,780
我都要放弃你了
I was about to give up on you.

600
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,820
是啊
Yeah.

601
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,720
这究竟是什么事啊
So what is this about, exactly?

602
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,020
你...
You, um...

603
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,130
-是雅达利派你来的吗  -不是
- Did Atari send you or - Oh, no.

604
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,230
不过  他们好心给了我
Although they were kind enough

605
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,000
一份《朝圣者》
to give me a copy of "Pilgrim."

606
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,010
-是吗  -只要问得巧  什么都能得到
- They did? - You can get anything if you know how to ask.

607
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,060
我觉得这游戏很有趣
I thought the game was interesting --

608
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,020
有缺点  但有趣
flawed, but interesting.

609
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,640
我从未玩过一个
I mean, I've never played a game

610
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,540
如此努力地设置障碍的游戏
that actively blocks your way so much.

611
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,000
是啊
Yeah.

612
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,990
我...是想尊重玩家
Well, I, uh -- I was trying to respect the gamer.

613
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,330
吸引他们
Engage them,

614
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,790
-不是把他们当作被动的接收者  -是尊重
- not treat them like a passive receptacle, but - Respect, sure,

615
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,480
但你显然不希望任何人破解游戏
but you clearly didn't want anyone to solve the game.

616
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,230
我不知道为什么  那是你的怪癖
Why, I have no idea. That's your thing.

617
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:05,270
但你创建来容纳谜题的世界
But the world that you created to contain the puzzles,

618
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,300
那个很有趣
that was interesting.

619
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,970
图像也很棒
And the graphics were incredible.

620
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,880
我相信这跟你的设想
I'm sure they still don't even come close

621
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,020
还是相去甚远
to what you saw in your head.

622
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,120
能满足我设想的电脑还没发明呢
Well, the computer for that doesn't exist yet.

623
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,130
真的吗
You sure?

624
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,510
处理器的速度在以指数增长
Processor speed is growing at an exponential rate.

625
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,950
我见到了现在的发展  令人震撼
I've seen what's happening, and it's mind-blowing.

626
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,450
因为问题是
'Cause here's the thing:

627
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,390
我不认为你是个游戏设计者
I don't think you're a game designer.

628
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,040
我认为你是个世界构建者
I think you're a world builder.

629
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,620
我想跟你合作
And I'd like to work with you.

630
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,420
我想看看你接下来要做什么
I want to see what you do next.

631
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,460
好吧
Okay.

632
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,060
那我为什么要想跟你合作
And why should I want to work with you?

633
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,460
因为我的条件是
Because here's what I'm offering:

634
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,440
不拉风投  不做干预
no VCs. No interference.

635
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,430
你在门罗互联网战略会议上说的话很对
What you said at MISC was spot on:

636
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,010
这个模式有问题
The model is broken.

637
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,430
是寄生关系
Parasitic.

638
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,830
所以我不打算妨碍你
So I plan to stay out of your way.

639
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,110
那我做什么呢
While I do what, exactly?

640
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,210
随你便
Whatever you want.

641
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,810
你没事吧
You okay?

642
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,370
嗯
Yup.

643
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,660
-想谈谈吗  -不
- You wanna talk? - Nope.

644
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,800
猎狗热狗
Hound Dogz.

645
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,290
我们昨天刚去过
We were just there yesterday.

646
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:22,310
嗯  她可喜欢那里了
Yep. She loves that place.

647
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,130
真不知为什么  那里食物好烂
No idea why, the food sucks.

648
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,970
或许不是为了食物
Maybe it's not about the food.

649
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,060
她什么时候回来
When's she coming back?

650
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,750
不知道  她不在这里工作了
No idea. She no longer works here.

651
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,440
你做了什么  解雇她吗
What did you do, fire her?

652
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,130
我让她选  她却走人了
I gave her a choice, and she walked.

653
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,800
那就把她找回来
So get her back.

654
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,990
乔  她在挂科
Joe, she's flunking her classes

655
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,110
而且态度很有问题
and copping some major attitude.

656
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,900
你不懂  海莉需要这里
You don't understand, Haley needs this place.

657
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,440
她跟其他孩子不一样
She's not like other kids.

658
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,780
她有不一样的
She's got different, um...

659
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,150
兴趣
interests.

660
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,110
好啊
Well, good for her.

661
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,940
她有点像我
She's a little like me.

662
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,590
我小时候
When I was a kid,

663
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,240
非常渴望有这样的地方
I would've given anything for a place like this,

664
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,300
一个让我有归属感的地方
someplace I could feel like I belonged.

665
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,130
是吗  做家长就是这样
Yeah? Well, this is what parenting is.

666
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:21,280
设下界线  始终一致  管教孩子
Setting limits, being consistent, and discipline.

667
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:22,890
你口气像我爸
You sound like my dad.

668
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,850
别拿我跟你爸爸比
Don't even start to compare me to your father

669
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:27,120
因为我们不是一个宇宙的
because the two of us are not even in the same universe.

670
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,900
我只是说  他从未真正看到我
All I'm saying is he never really saw me.

671
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,670
他只希望我像他
He just wanted me to be like him.

672
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,510
我是说  我看海莉看得很清楚
All I'm saying is that I see Haley just fine.

673
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,610
好吧  我或许没跟她一起喝过奶昔
Okay, I may not sit around sipping milkshakes with her,

674
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,750
但我很了解我的女儿
but I know exactly who my daughter is.

675
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,070
你确定吗
Are you sure about that?

676
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,080
这话什么意思
All right, what the hell is that supposed to mean?

677
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,480
没事
Nothing.

678
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,350
我只是想为海莉好
I just want what's best for Haley.

679
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,710
得了  乔
Oh, come on, Joe.

680
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,370
你对她的关心
You don't give a shit about her

681
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,310
仅限于她能为公司贡献什么
beyond what she can do for this company.

682
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,330
你只想为自己好
You just want what's best for you.

683
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,230
所以你不是家长  你也永远不会是
That's why you're not a parent and you never will be.

684
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,930
你说的对
You're right.

685
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,260
你打到哪一级了
What level is that?

686
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,870
两位  学校怎么样
Guys. How was school?

687
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,610
她跟爸爸吵架了
She had a fight with Dad.

688
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,230
你怎么这么早就回家了
What're you doing home so early?

689
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,250
我不舒服
I wasn't feeling well.

690
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,280
翘班  棒
Cutting work. Nice.

691
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,330
我们今天来了个很酷的代课老师
We had a cool sub today.

692
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,200
-是吗  -她是个美国人
- Oh, yeah? - She's American,

693
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,530
但她去法国上的大学
but she went to college in France.

694
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,360
据说  你可以去做
Apparently, you can do, like, some, like,

695
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,610
交换学生
international-student thing,

696
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,020
她说那可棒了
and she said it's, like, it was amazing

697
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,450
她还在法国电影馆看了些电影
and that she saw these films at the Cinémathèque,

698
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,280
还说他们有好多
and that, um, they have all these, like,

699
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,980
很酷的课程  电影  摄影
really cool programs for, like, film and photography, and --

700
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,150
你知道我喜欢你哪点吗  琼妮
Do you know what I love about you, Joanie?

701
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:26,320
你好...无畏
You are so...fearless.

702
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,990
你知道吗
You know?

703
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,510
我希望你永远别变
I hope you never lose that.

704
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:37,190
永远别因为害怕就拒绝什么
Just don't ever say no to something because you're scared.

705
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,430
你想来跟我一起玩吗
You want to come play with me?

706
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,130
来吧  我教你诀窍
Come on. I'll show you all my secrets.

707
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,960
不用了
It's okay.

708
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,030
我
I'm gonna, um...

709
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:53,380
还是去看看海莉在干什么
I'm gonna go check with Haley and see what she's up to.

710
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,110
-好吧  -嗯
- Uh, okay. - Yeah.

711
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,980
你想去哪
Where do you want to go?

712
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,770
喂
Hello?

713
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,350
乔
Joe.

714
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,970
是博斯
Hey, it's Bos.

715
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,700
卡梅伦在吗
Is Cameron there?

716
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:35,940
不在
No.

717
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,120
抱歉  要留个言吗
Sorry. You want to leave a message?

718
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,700
不了  我
No, no. I'll just...

719
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,020
待会儿再打好了
I'll just call back later.

720
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,630
你还好吗
How're you holding up?

721
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,660
这个嘛
Well...

722
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,900
真是一团糟
What a mess.

723
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,160
我跟自己说  是因为骄傲
Well, I told myself it was pride --

724
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,390
就是愚蠢的骄傲
just stupid pride.

725
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,820
但其实
But the truth is...

726
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,240
我想知道我还有价值
I wanted to know I still mattered,

727
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,610
我想知道我可以做一番大事
wanted to know I could shake things up.

728
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,930
任务达成了
Mission accomplished.

729
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,140
我闯了大祸
They is shook.

730
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,340
是啊
Yeah.

731
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,160
这我可不了解
Well, I wouldn't know anything about that.

732
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,210
我做的那些事
You know, the things that I've done...

733
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,050
我都不知道我为什么那么做
I don't even know why I did them.

734
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,610
我就是想要一切
I just wanted everything,

735
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,740
我不在乎
and I didn't care what

736
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,200
要为此做的任何事
or who I had to go through to get it.

737
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,740
是啊
Yeah.

738
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,410
那家伙
That guy.

739
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:57,850
真是个混蛋
He was a real asshole.

740
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,620
我好像曾雇过他
I think I hired him once.

741
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:01,660
或许我还是那种人
Maybe I'm still that guy,

742
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,650
而大家都看得清  只有我看不清
and everybody can see it but me.

743
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:07,380
不  认清自己是混蛋就已经成功一半了
No. Recognizing you're an asshole is half the battle.

744
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,060
但我见到了你对卡梅多坦诚
But I've seen how honest you've been with Cam.

745
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:14,460
那跟我最初认识的那个人不一样  乔
That's a different man than the one I first met, Joe.

746
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,560
我自己也需要变变
I could've used some of that myself.

747
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,140
我们都有禁区
Oh, we've got our no-go zones.

748
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,800
是啊  你撒谎  说自己喜欢芭蕾什么的
Well, sure, you lie and say you love the ballet or whatever.

749
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,280
或许  你们中一个想要孩子
Or maybe one of you wants kids,

750
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,380
另一个不想
the other one doesn't

751
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,420
所以你就没说出来
so you just keep it to yourself.

752
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,230
卡梅想要孩子
Cam wants kids?

753
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,970
或许她能让你意外
Well, maybe she'll surprise you.

754
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,550
她或许也能让你意外
She might surprise you, too.

755
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:47,960
祝你好运
Good luck.

756
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,120
等等
Wait.

757
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,720
如果你需要个地方住  我随时欢迎你
If you need a place to stay, you're always welcome.

758
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,490
*或许那是软弱的迹象*
*Maybe it's a sign of weakness*

759
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,140
*当我不知该说什么*
*When I don't know what to say*

760
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,750
*或许我就是不知道*
*Maybe I just wouldn't know*

761
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:13,290
*该如何使用我的力量*
*What to do with my strength anyway*

762
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,640
*我们是否已成习惯*
*Have we become a habit?*

763
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,130
*我们是否扭曲了事实*
*Do we distort the facts?*

764
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:24,870
*现在没法向前看*
*Now, there's no looking forward*

765
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,540
*没法退后*
*Now, there's no turning back*

766
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,480
*你说我们属于光明*
*When you say we belong to the light*

767
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,660
*我们属于雷电*
*We belong to the thunder*

768
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:37,810
*我们属于誓言的*
*We belong to the sound of the words*

769
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,810
*声音*
*We've both fallen under*

770
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,910
*不管是否认还是接受*
*Whatever we deny or embrace*

771
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,660
*不管是坏还是好*
*For worse or for better*

772
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,990
*我们是一起的*
*We belong, we belong*

773
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,970
*我们属于彼此*
*We belong together*

774
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:57,150
*我们属于彼此*
*We belong*

775
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,000
*我们属于光明*
*We belong to the light*

776
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,970
*我们属于雷电*
*We belong to the thunder*

777
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:23,740
怎么回事啊
So...what happened?

778
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,400
我喝了两杯酒
I had two glasses of wine.

779
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,570
那警察显然是罚单没开够
That cop obviously needed to fill his quota --

780
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,420
我们纳的税派上用场了
our tax dollars at work.

781
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,880
但是
But, I mean, um,

782
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,430
你以前从未被开过罚单
you've never even gotten a ticket before.

783
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,070
是啊  现在有了
Yeah, well, now I have.

784
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,790
怎么了
What?

785
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,070
我在想象22岁的自己
I was just picturing my 22-year-old self

786
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,720
走进AGGEK
walking into AGGEK,

787
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,160
拖着交响乐
lugging the Symphonic.

788
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,940
她坐下  开始推介
She sits down, she pitches...

789
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,330
然后我击垮了她
and I crush her.

790
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,480
年轻的我毫无胜算
The young me doesn't stand a chance.

791
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,700
得了
Oh, please.

792
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:20,880
那个22岁的你也不是单纯无辜
That 22-year-old was hardly sweet and innocent.

793
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:24,680
现在的你也没那么无情
And the present you isn't so ruthless.

794
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,290
而且那都是你  所有的你
And they're all you, all the versions.

795
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,650
你一直是同一个人
You're the same person that you always were.

796
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,310
而且
And...

797
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:38,470
我爱那个人
I love that person.

798
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:08,170
谢谢你让我过来
Thanks for letting me come by.

799
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,510
不客气
Sure.

800
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,290
坐吗
Sit down?

801
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:28,030
当然了  我们会补偿你
Obviously, we will compensate you.

802
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,510
我觉得我们可以...
I thought we could start --

803
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:30,850
不必
No need.

804
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,100
不用付费
No payment necessary.

805
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,240
好吧
Okay.

806
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:49,730
谢谢
Well, thank you.

807
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,350
别担心  我不会告诉乔
Don't worry. I won't tell Joe.

808
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,100
他已经知道了
He already knows.

809
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,400
你没事吧
You okay?

810
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,050
这事谢谢你
Thank you for this.

811
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:33,850
我不会再来打扰你了
I won't bother you again.

812
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,390
皮特  慢点
Hey, Pete, slow down.

813
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:53,810
我要去个地方  就回来
I want to make a quick stop.

814
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:28,000
欢迎来猎狗热狗  需要点什么吗
Welcome to Hound Dogz, can I help you?

815
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,460
嗯  我要...
Yeah, let me get a, uh...

816
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:33,320
早餐玉米煎饼  和一杯小咖啡
a breakfast burrito and a small coffee.

817
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,760
好的  2.8美元
Yeah, that'll be $2.80.

818
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,120
玉米煎饼和一杯小咖啡  谢谢
Could I get a burrito and a small coffee?

819
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,390
就来
Coming right up.

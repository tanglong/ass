怎么会
No, I wasn't.

44
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,650
没事没事
No, that's all right, that's all right.

45
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,420
我很欣慰我还算可接的那类
I'm just glad I still rate a pick-up.

博斯  求求你别再要我去做那些...
Bos, please don't ask me to do something --

53
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,800
不是  跟工作没关系
Oh, no, it has nothing to do with work.

早上好
Good morning.

65
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,300
你是不是有什么东西昨天就该给我了
Wasn't there something you were supposed to give me yesterday?

66
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,710
你是指什么
What do you mean?

67
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,750
你的生物考试
Your biology test.

68
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,670
昨天不是拿到成绩了吗
Weren't you getting that back yesterday?

69
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,960
是拿到了  我得了A
Yeah, I did. I got an "A."

70
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,250
那真是太好了
Well, that's terrific.

71
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,990
在哪呢
Where is it?

72

你想看吗
You want to see it?

73
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,890
是  拿来我看看
Yes. Yes, I would.

74
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,820
我说我得了A  我就是得了A
Well, if I say I got an "A," I got an "A."

75
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,150
这样的话  那我们可以商量
If that's true, then maybe we can talk

76
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,330
让你每周回彗星上几天班的事了
about you coming back to Comet a few days a week.

77
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,570
可我不想去
But I don't want to.

78
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,760
你说我可以在那里上班
You said that I would keep working there

79
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,130
只要我觉得好玩
as long as it was fun.

80
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,670
现在不好玩了
And it's not fun anymore.

81
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,890
她的发型你真不打算说两句吗
You're seriously not gonna say anything about the haircut?

82
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,920
你觉得我说了有用吗
Do you seriously think that that would help?

83
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,810
我的天
Holy shit!

84
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,780
我们需要证婚人
Well, we need witnesses.

85
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,680
既然她把她女儿叫来了
Since she brought her daughter...

86
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,480
你怎么不早告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

87
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,400
因为我们不想大动干戈
Well, because we're not making a fuss.

88
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,780
可是我至少可以换正装来啊
Yeah, but I would have... dressed up.

89
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,120
这样就很好
You're perfect.

90
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,540
谢谢你能来
Thank you for coming.

91
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,650
快读读  然后
Read it and weep...

92
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,260
喜极而泣吧
with joy.

93
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,440
我不想表现得太沾沾自喜  因为
Now, I don't want to get too far ahead of myself because...

94
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,150
我这人就这样  不过
that's my nature, but...

95
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,340
流浪者正在碾压竞争对手
Rover is crushing the competition --

96
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,830
包括你前夫的公司
your ex's company included.

97
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,160
没别的意思
No disrespect.

98
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,720
我们可以叫它"彗星"
We can call it Comet.

99
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,910
他们输的可惨了
Well, they're getting walloped.

100
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,460
我们的流量非常惊人  是彗星的两倍呢
Our traffic is phenomenal. It's twice what Comet is seeing.

101
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,670
用户得到想要的结果一般需要多久
How long is it taking people to find what they're looking for?

我听说你打算去休个应得的假
So, I hear that you're taking some well-earned vacation time.

107
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,100

或者更重要的是

你和谁去
who you going with?

110
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,260
我哪都不去  就在本地放松放松
I'm not going anywhere. Just a little local R&R.

111
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,540
挺好的
Good for you.

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,450

113
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,200
多谢你跟我通报情况

你多保重
You take care of yourself.

116
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,050
别人可不会照顾你
No one else will.

117
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,890
是吧
Am I right?

118
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,400
没错
I'm right.

119

园艺用具

126
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,220

办公室的空调到底还是坏了

他们今天上午临时决定的
They just decided to do it this morning.

134
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,850
看来他们终于把问题解决了
I guess they finally worked things out.

135
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,100
他们说是因为现实原因  不过我说不好
They said it was for practical reasons, but I don't know.

136
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,050
当他们在礼台上说着誓词
When they were up there saying their vows,

137
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,770
注视着对方的眼睛
looking in each other's eyes...

138
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,120
你不会也湿了眼眶了吧
Are you getting misty?

139
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,840
我没有  我只是替他们高兴
I'm not. I'm just happy for them.

140
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,340

我只希望他们以后生活美满
I just hope it works out for them.

143
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,350
比我们以前的糟糕关系要好
You know, better than it did for our sorry asses.

144
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,950
我的意思是
I mean...

145
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,030
和其他人谈的恋爱  不是现在这次
our other relationships, not this one.

146
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,860
我懂我懂
I get it, I get it, I get it.

147
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,470
你是不是很急
You're not in a rush, are you?

148
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,620
对  我想回去工作
Well, yes, I want to get back to work.

149

151
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,560
让我走吧  我一早上时间就这么没了
Oh, please. I lost a whole morning because of this.

152
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,600
公众对互联网的理解

153
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,760
-阿莱克莎明天要来  -非常让人吃惊
- Alexa's coming tomorrow, - is really surprising.

154
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,210
如果是博斯之外的人  我根本不会接电话
and I wouldn't even have picked up if it was anybody but Bos.

155
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,520
还有你
Or you.

156
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,630
我也会接你的电话
I would have picked up for you.

157
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,950
别  别  走吧
No. No. Go on, get out.

158
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,420
-从我家出去  -好
- Get out of my apartment. - Okay.

159
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,110
你家里没厕纸了
You're out of toilet paper.

160
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,620
也许我今晚会去你那儿
Maybe I'll come out there tonight.

161
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,680
你竟然要自愿去清风房车
You want to come out to the Airstream voluntarily?

162
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,080
我可能需要一些厕纸
I might need some toilet paper.

163
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,660
太好了  你可以见见大家
That's fantastic! You can meet everybody.

164
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,260
我走啦
Okay!

165
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,890
我花了好长时间才哄比莉从角落里出来
And then I had to spend hours coaxing Billie out of the corner.

166
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,990
等我终于让她动起来了
And when I finally get her to move,

167
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:53,260
宾就突然开始发疯似的到处乱蹦
Bing gets a wild hair and starts bouncing all over the walls.

168
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,000
看  现在看它们啊
Look! And now look at them.

169
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,630
成完美的小天使了
Perfect little angels.

170
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,800
过来  快来看
Hey, come here, come look.

171
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,280
我以为我们要去散步
I thought we were going for a hike.

172
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,590
我们是要去  我只是想对
We are, I just want to, um, make one...

173
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,880
碰撞检测稍做下微调
minor tweak to the collision detection.

174
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,230
两秒钟就好
It will take two seconds.

175
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,700
这里景色可真美
It sure is pretty out here.

176
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,770
老天  看看这个
Oh, my God. Look at this.

177
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,780
我们应该盖一栋房子
We should build a house.

178
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,520
做个漂亮的露天平台
Something with a nice deck.

179
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,950
比莉真是厉害
I mean, Billie is bad-ass.

180
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,060
不要特别大
Nothing major.

181
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,090
就几个房间
Just a couple rooms...

182
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,230
两个  或许三个
two, maybe three.

183
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,950
然后怎么  露台就立即撤退
But then, what, Gazebo just instantly retreats

184
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,300
除非有食物吗
unless there's food?

185
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,790
我们该在每个房间里都建壁炉
We should have a fireplace in every room --

186
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,460
连浴室也是
even the bathroom.

187
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,330
消防滑杆
Fire pole?

188
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,000
跳钢管舞管
Stripper pole.

189
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,190
任何种类的钢管
Any kind of pole.

190
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,020
我觉得我们散步的时机快过去了
I feel like our hiking window is slipping away.

191
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,490
很荣幸能在你工作的地方
It has been a pleasure to fall asleep

192
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,030
睡着和醒来
and wake up in your work space.

193
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,730
我发誓  只要两分钟
I swear to God, two minutes.

194
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,940
我知道你是真心这么想的
I know you believe that when you say it.

195
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,700
等等
Wait, wait.

196
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,720
我今晚能请你吃晚饭吗
Can I take you to dinner tonight?

197
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,240
怎么  你觉得愧疚了
Oh, you feeling guilty?

198
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,680
有一点
Yeah, a little.

199
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,060
拜托
Please?

200
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,500
我们进城去  可以睡在大床上
We'll go into town, we can sleep in the big bed.

201
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,920
这才像话
Ooh. Now you're talking.

202
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,350
我晚点打给你
I'll call you later.

203
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,140
祝我好运
Hey, wish me luck!

204
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,150
好运
Luck?

205
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,860
你要运气做什么
What the hell would you need that for?

206
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,800
天呐
Oh, my God!

207
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,980
到底有多短
How short are we talking?

208
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,370
反正...
Well, it's um...

209
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,520
非常短
it's pretty short.

210
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,290
就是比桃乐茜·哈米尔要短
Like, shorter than Dorothy Hamill's,

211
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,290
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}美国滑冰运动员

212
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,880
但没有马克·哈米尔那么短
but not as short as Mark Hamill's.

213
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,880
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}美国男演员  出演过《星球大战》

214
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,050
两者中间吧
Uh, somewhere mid-Hamill.

215
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,550
精灵短发吗
Well, is it pixie-ish?

216
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,310
是像奥黛丽·赫本那样还是...
Is it like Audrey Hepburn or...

217
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,710
米娅·法罗
Mia Farrow

218
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,710
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}均为美国女演员

219
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,400
唐娜  唐娜  唐娜  不是那种发型
Donna, Donna, Donna, it is not that kind of haircut.

220
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,920
好吧  不是时髦的  你不会喜欢的
Okay, it's not fashionable. You're not gonna like it.

221
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,280
她为什么要这么做  她的头发那么美
Why would she do that? She has such beautiful hair.

222
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,290
我觉得可能她是想理清头绪
Well, I think maybe she's trying to work some stuff out.

223
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,050
做出某种声明
You know, make some kind of statement.

224
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,970
所有15岁的女孩都应该待在一个岛上
All 15-year-old girls should be just put on an island

225
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,340
直到她们准备好进入社会
until they're ready for civilized society.

226
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,810
我觉得有些女孩就是比其他人更不好过些
I think some girls just struggle more than others.

227
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,810
得了吧  海莉没事的
Oh, come on. Haley's fine.

228
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,520
我只是想在你看见她前给你提个醒
I just wanted to give you a heads-up before you saw it.

229
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,940
很感谢你这周照看她们
I appreciate you taking them this week.

230
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,430
我真的需要一段不被打扰的时间
I really just needed some... uninterrupted time.

231
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,190
嗯
Yeah.

232
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,430
戒酒会怎么样
How are the meetings going?

233
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,320
我在无聊和惊恐之间来回切换
I toggle between boredom and horror.

234
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:52,320
有人分享了一个由麻醉剂引发了便秘的故事
Someone shared a story about narcotic-induced constipation

235
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,360
我再没法把那个画面从脑中抹去了
that I will never be able to un-hear.

236
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,570
我就盼着这一切结束
Yeah, I'll just be happy when it's all over.

237
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,780
还有一个可爱的丢脸的结局
And as a lovely humiliation coda...

238
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,990
我被踢出流浪者了
I got kicked off Rover.

239
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,330
闭嘴
Shut up.

240
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,490
怎么了
What happened?

241
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,500
就是那一切
Just everything.

242
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,240
卡梅  博斯  戴安
Cam, Bos, Diane --

243
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,590
真是一场完美的糟糕风暴
it was a perfect storm of awful.

244
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,400
我很抱歉
Well, I'm sorry.

245
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,750
至少我们现在不是直接竞争对手了
I mean, at least we're not direct competitors anymore.

246
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,540
等彗星打败流浪者时  我心里会好受很多
It'll make it a lot easier when Comet kicks Rover's ass.

247
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,400
是吗  你哪来的自信
Oh, yeah? What makes you think that's ever gonna happen?

248
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,610
我们进展不错
Well, we're doing pretty well.

249
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,170
准备进行大力市场推广
About to launch a big marketing push.

250
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,520
你知道你们的用户数量吗
Do you know what your user numbers are?

251
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,650
知道  我们一天有5万点击量
Yeah. We got 50,000 hits a day.

252
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,020
流浪者是它的两倍
Rover's doing twice that.

253
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,630
每个用户能在35秒内找到他们想找的
The average user finds what they're looking for in 35 seconds.

254
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,080
很厉害
That's impressive.

255
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,940
是很厉害
Yeah, it is.

256
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,500
但同时也暴露出了它的弱点
But it's also what makes it vulnerable.

257
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,410
怎么说
What do you mean?

258
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,240
我觉得这场战争的赢家
I'm not convinced this fight gets won

259
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,130
不会是搜索速度快的那个网站
by the site that keeps traffic moving.

260
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,520
而是能留住用户的那个
I think it might go to the one that keeps users around.

261
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,860
这很有道理
Look, it makes so much sense.

262
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,910
我们为什么要致力于成为速度最快的网站
Why are we working so hard to become the fastest site

263
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,200
而不去做
when we could become the...

264
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,130
最能留人的
the stickiest?

265
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,260
如果我们能留住用户
If we can keep users hanging around,

266
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,760
那就能留住广告商
then we can start locking in advertisers.

267
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,140
但我们网站的意义在于把用户传递到其他网站
But the whole point is to deliver them to other sites.

268
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,680
不  但我们仍能这样做
No, but we could still do that.

269
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,250
但我们的网站也可以是个的目的地
But it could also be a destination in itself.

270
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,250
据唐娜所说的  我们比起流浪者差远了
Look, a-according to Donna, we're not even close.

271
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,260
-唐娜说的  -是啊
- Donna? - Yeah.

272
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,920
跟她有什么关系
What does she have to do with anything?

273
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,310
没什么  她今早来了一趟  我们
Nothing. She stopped by this morning, and we got to --

274
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,820
不
No, no.

275
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,190
我们不能听从唐娜的商业建议
We're not taking business advice from Donna.

276
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,860
是好主意的话  谁说的又有什么关系
Who cares where it comes from if it's a good idea?

277
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,940
她是我们的直接竞争对手
She's our direct competition.

278
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,240
怎么能听她的
Why would we listen to what she has to say?

279
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,530
因为她是这场竞争中消息灵通的选手
Because she's a really well-informed player in the field.

280
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,310
我们不能被唐娜的话耽误
We're not gonna be derailed by Donna.

281
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,200
我们要继续执行这个市场推广计划
We're gonna move forward with this marketing plan,

282
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,370
我也很高兴他们
and I'm really excited about what they're --

283
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,890
既然都要重新设计网站了
What's the point in coming up with a marketing plan

284
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,970
为什么还要制定市场计划
when we're gonna end up redesigning the whole site?

285
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,670
因为我们不打算重新设计网站
Because we are not going to redesign the whole site.

286
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,820
抱歉打扰了
I'm really sorry to interrupt,

287
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,510
但我们外面冻死了
but we are freezing out there.

288
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,110
我不知道昨天那人做了什么
I don't know what that guy did yesterday,

289
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,500
我觉得他可能想低温冷藏我们
but I think he's trying to cryogenically preserve us.

290
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,840
流浪者的平均访问时间为30秒
The average visit to Rover takes 30 seconds, okay?

291
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,320
而我们网站远超过1分钟
Whereas the average visit to us takes well over a minute.

292
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,980
我不相信这个数据
I don't trust that data.

293
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,560
你太荒唐了
You're being ridiculous.

294
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,040
你是又和她睡了吗
Are you sleeping with her again?

295
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,540
我在和我前妻上床吗
Am I sleeping with my ex-wife?

296
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,030
是的
Yeah.

297
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,010
我们打得火热呢
We're going at it like rabbits.

298
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,550
而凯蒂...
And Katie...

299
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,320
她对此完全没有意见
she's cool with it.

300
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,520
你们接触太频繁了
Been spending a lot of time together.

301
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,850
远超平时
Much more than usual.

302
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,190
她是我孩子的母亲  我们经常见面
She's the mother of my children. We see each other.

303
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,320
我就不该告诉你这是她的主意
I shouldn't even have told you the idea came from her.

304
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,980
那样你就会觉得这主意棒极了
Then you would have thought it was a great idea.

305
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,700
但这确实是她出的  而我是不会接受一个
But it did come from her, and I'm not taking business advice

306
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,310
致力于让我公司失败的人的商业建议的
from someone who's goal is to dance on the carcass of my company.

307
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,870
别这样  她没那么坏
Okay, come on. She's not that bad.

308
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,230
再说  她都不是...
Besides, she's not even...

309
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,690
她...
Look, she's...

310
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,840
她现在处境变了  好吗
She's in a different place now, all right?

311
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,690
她有其他的事要考虑
She has other things to worry about.

312
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,710
更何况她女儿在这儿工作好吗
Besides, her daughter works here, for Christ's sake!

313
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,710
你真觉得她会想尽办法
You really think she's gonna go out of her way

314
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,560
去毁掉她女儿所在的公司吗
to try and destroy a company that her daughter works at?

315
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,890
但她女儿已经不在这里工作了
But her daughter doesn't work here anymore.

316
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,930
现在是下手的最好时机
Now is the perfect time for her to strike.

317
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,050
她又不是个忍者  乔
She's not a ninja, Joe.

318
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,520
我来修  我来修
I got it, I got it!

319
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,610
我的天
Oh, my.

320
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,220
恕我冒昧来访  只是...
I'm sorry to barge in. It's just...

321
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,450
戈登告诉了我  而我...
Gordon told me the news, and I...

322
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,400
快请进来
Please, come in.

323
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,370
我们不是要瞒着任何人
We weren't trying to keep it from anyone,

324
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,500
只是这一切都发生得太快了
it just all happened so quickly.

325
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,050
你不会是怀孕了吧
Are you pregnant?

326
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,530
亲爱的  唐娜来了
Honey, Donna's here.

327
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,250
她还带来了一个蒂芙尼的大礼盒
And she brought something massive from Tiffany's.

328
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,290
-只是个...  -你太客气了
- Oh, it's... - You shouldn't have.

329
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:58,920
什么
What?

330
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,740
我都不知道蒂芙尼有那么大的盒子
I didn't know Tiffany's made a box that big.

331
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,900
看看你  健康又快乐
Look at you -- all happy and healthy.

332
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,880
见到你真好
Good to see ya.

333
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,360
是啊  感觉很好
Yeah, feeling good.

334
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,230
可以再去吃顿饭了
Ready for another dinner.

335
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,870
不过得换个餐厅
Different restaurant, though.

336
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,750
我只是想来说声恭喜
I just wanted to say congratulations.

337
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,820
我真是太为你们高兴了
I'm... I'm so happy for you.

338
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,380
我们真的只是为了税才结婚的
Well, we really only did it for tax reasons.

339
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,560
是啊  鉴于我差点死了
Yeah, on account of me almost dying.

340
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,090
这我可说不好  你们毕竟交换了誓言
I don't know. You pledged your troths.

341
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,680
我觉得这很浪漫
I feel like that's romantic.

342
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,580
大家都这么说
Well, that's what people keep telling us.

343
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,270
亲爱的  我能单独和唐娜谈谈吗
Sweetheart, can I have a minute with Donna --

344
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,450
如果你有空的话
if you have time?

345
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,840
当然
Mm, sure.

346
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,210
来
Here.

347
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,210
天呐  这玩意好沉
Geez! This thing's heavier than hell.

348
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,850
就是个大酒杯
Oh, it's just -- it's a punch bowl, I --

349
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,270
大酒杯
Punch bowl.

350
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,820
亲爱的  我们家的大酒杯都放哪里
Oh, sweetheart, where do we keep our punch bowls?

351
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,560
-放餐具室  我回头处理  -好
- Put it in the pantry. I'll take care of it. - Okay.

352
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,300
直接放在黛安车后座上吧
Or you can just put it right in the back of Diana's car

353
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,260
让她拿去换件漂亮的首饰
so she can exchange it for a nice piece of jewelry.

354
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,660
那我能得到什么啊
What the hell do I get?

355
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,600
黛安啊
You get Diane.

356
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,360
说得对
Oh. Fair enough!

357
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,120
唐娜
Donna...

358
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,590
首先  我该向你道歉
first of all, I owe you an apology.

359
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,730
我...
I was...

360
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,890
在流浪者的事上挺粗暴的
rough about Rover.

361
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,720
不  不需要道歉
No, look, no apology necessary.

362
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,660
那个
It was a...

363
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,040
情况很复杂
complex situation.

364
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,390
都过去了
Water under the bridge.

365
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,340
我想告诉你
I wanted to let you know

366
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,460
我准备从执行合伙人的位置上退下来了
that I'm getting ready to step back as managing partner.

367
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,030
真的
Really?

368
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,800
我们是清楚明白地知道
We got the message loud and clear

369
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,330
人不会永生不死了
about not living forever.

370
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,450
如果我想好好陪伴我的新丈夫
And if I want to spend time with my new husband...

371
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,200
执行合伙人可不是兼职工作
managing partner is not a part-time job.

372
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,410
你打算什么时候退
When were you thinking about doing this?

373
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,550
尽快了
Soon-ish.

374
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,340
我想告诉你  如果你还想做这个
I wanted to let you know that if you still want the job...

375
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,150
我会支持你
I'll back you.

376
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,470
我...
I...

377
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,930
当然了
Of course.

378
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,300
我想
I do.

379
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,550
那就好
Good.

380
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,940
我不能直接钦点你
I mean, I can't just anoint you.

381
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,890
当然
No, of course.

382
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,780
但我还是有很重要的一票的
But I do have a pretty jumbo-sized vote.

383
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,340
谢谢
Thank you.

384
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,160
我们庆祝一下吧  香槟  琴酒
Should we celebrate? Some champagne, gin?

385
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,320
水就好
You know, just water would be great.

386
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,370
好吧
Okay.

387
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,630
抱歉  我知道这里有点乱
Sorry, I know it's a little insane in here, but...

388
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,310
没事  很好的
No, no, it's --- it's perfect.

389
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,600
我听到"林中房车"时都不知道会是怎样的
I didn't know what to expect when I heard "trailer in the woods."

390
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,360
嗯
Yeah.

391
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,260
我觉得我是走进了你的大脑
I feel like I just walked into your brain.

392
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,080
不  我大脑里才没这么整洁呢
Oh, no, my brain is not as tidy as this.

393
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,050
你想看看吗
Do you want to see?

394
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,400
-当然  -好
- Of course. - Okay.

395
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,160
这还都是基本的
So it's all still pretty basic,

396
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,240
但是  我在做的是
but what I've been trying to do

397
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,530
创造有鲜明个性的机器人
is create bots with distinct personalities

398
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,330
他们的选择会依
and whose choices change depending on --

399
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,170
所处环境而变
on the circumstances they're in.

400
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,030
-自学式人工智能  -没错
- Self-learning A.I. - Exactly.

401
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,390
所以不仅仅是玩家在操作游戏
So it's not just the player acting upon the game,

402
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,720
游戏自己也有变化
it's the game acting upon itself

403
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,980
玩家要努力跟上节奏
and then the player has to try and catch up.

404
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:14,050
这是宾和比莉
So this is Bing and Billie,

405
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,940
这是露台
and this is Gazebo.

406
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,540
我还有一堆  他们三个是主角
I have a bunch, but these are kind of the main three.

407
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,380
我是想创造一个
What I'm really trying to do is create a world

408
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,800
行为有对应后果的世界
in which actions have consequences, you know?

409
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,140
我在《朝圣者》里就是想这么做
I mean, I was trying to do that with Pilgrim, too,

410
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,850
但那个游戏看来是太...
but I guess that game was too...

411
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,160
孤独  太难了吧
solitary or hard or whatever.

412
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,620
但是  在这里  我觉得我创造了
But, um, here, I feel like I'm creating characters

413
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,560
有能力积累记忆
that have the ability to accrue memory and -- and -- and --

414
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,100
发展个人故事线  并随时间改变的人物
and develop a personal narrative and -- and change over time.

415
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,490
这都感觉很
And it's all just feeling really...

416
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,720
浸入式  很完整
immersive and complete.

417
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,690
-很不错  -嗯
- Really great. - Yeah.

418
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,670
我知道你肯定能做好  我并不意外
I mean, I was expecting great, so I'm not surprised.

419
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,060
你想看看我正在进行的一些部分吗
So do you want to see some of the more, um, in-progress work?

420
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,850
好啊
Sure.

421
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,890
要不我们出去走走
Or maybe we could go for a little hike,

422
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,100
再聊聊大局
talk more big-picture.

423
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,870
这外面好美
It's just so gorgeous out here.

424
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,020
好吧
Okay.

425
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,000
这不是你想要的吗
So it wasn't really what you were looking for?

426
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,330
不是
No, no. It's just...

427
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,010
我觉得有时候  你处于开阔的空间时
sometimes I think the ideas can get bigger

428
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,700
思维也会更加开阔
when the space around you does.

429
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,540
是啊
Yeah.

430
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,150
没错  那我们
Yes. Let's...

431
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,940
我一整天都想出去转转来着
I've been trying to get out for a hike all day.

432
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,670
我们出去吧
Let's -- Let's get out there.

433
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,810
我们可以叫人来
We can call a guy.

434
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,690
我叫过人了  他搞得更糟了
I already called a guy, he made it worse.

435
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,790
你不也是
So did you.

436
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,960
就是断路器坏了  我修得好
Look, it's a bad breaker. I can fix that.

437
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,970
没那么简单
It's more than a bad breaker.

438
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,490
你真不叫人来吗
You sure you don't want to call a guy?

439
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,590
拜托  这又不是高深的科学
You guys, this is not rocket science.

440
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,030
好吧
Okay.

441
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,930
谢谢给我们下午放假
Thanks for the afternoon off.

442
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,670
我没给你们放假
I didn't give you the afternoon off.

443
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,560
是要你们在家工作的
You're supposed to be working from home.

444
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,380
我说什么了
What did I say?

445
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,680
好吧  晚上见
All right, I'll see you tonight.

446
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,750
要我带点什么吗
Can I bring anything?

447
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,590
不用  我都准备了
Nope. Got all that covered.

448
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,660
你是个管事的人
You're a take-charge mama jama.

449
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,840
别炸掉什么
Try not to blow anything up.

450
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,950
我尽量
I'll try.

451
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,230
卡梅说唐娜上周去清风房车时
Cam said Donna was looking pretty rough

452
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,560
看上去很不好
when she came by the Airstream last week.

453
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,170
她有什么事吗
Is something going on with her?

454
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,940
卡梅伦说  她看上去不像她自己
Cameron said she didn't seem like herself.

455
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,820
卡梅八卦唐娜的事干什么
Why is Cam gossiping about Donna?

456
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,480
她担心
She was concerned.

457
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,650
我就是不信任她
Look, I just don't trust the woman.

458
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,670
我知道她是你的家人
I know she's your family,

459
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,000
我不该说什么
I'm not supposed to have an opinion about her,

460
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,900
但我不信任她
but I don't trust her.

461
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,860
海莉把头发剪了
Haley cut all of her hair off, okay?

462
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,990
剪得像男孩一样短
Short. Like a boy.

463
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,910
唐娜今早过来谈这事  但是
Donna came over this morning to talk about it, except...

464
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,470
短发
Well, short hair...

465
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,970
不代表什么啊
doesn't mean anything.

466
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:08,330
看来我那天不该冲你吼的
Well... apparently, I shouldn't have barked at you the other day.

467
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,930
听别人说一件你不知道的关于你孩子的事
But it's really tough hearing something about your kid

468
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,820
很让人不舒服
that you don't know about.

469
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,970
我能提个建议吗
Can I make one suggestion?

470
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,970
海莉现在一定不能觉得孤立无援
It's really important for Haley not to feel isolated right now.

471
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,730
这里非常适合她
This place is such a great fit for her.

472
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,610
我希望你能让她回来
I wish you'd let her come back.

473
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,610
我希望她回来
I want her to,

474
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:37,300
但她现在似乎非要恨我
but she seems pretty intent on hating me right now.

475
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,330
但她信任你
She trusts you, though.

476
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,140
她带你去了那间餐馆  不是吗
I mean, she took you to that restaurant, didn't she?

477
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,830
克拉克家
Clark residence.

478
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,470
海莉  我是乔·麦克米伦
Haley, Joe MacMillan.

479
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,420
我爸今天不在
Oh, my dad's not here today.

480
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,920
其实  我是找你的
Actually, I'm calling to speak to you.

481
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,180
我听说你不打算回彗星了
I hear you're not interested in coming back to Comet,

482
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,960
这让我很难过
and that really bums me out.

483
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,990
我也难过
It bums me out, too.

484
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,210
那就回来嘛
So come back.

485
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,200
我觉得那样不太好
I don't think that's a good idea.

486
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,780
怎么不好  我们需要你
Of course it is. We need you.

487
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,930
-我不知道  我...  -怎么了
- I don't know. I -- I just... - What?

488
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,300
我就是觉得我不该给我爸打工
I just don't think I should be working for my dad --

489
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,690
或是跟他共事  不管我们是怎么回事
or with him, or whatever that arrangement was.

490
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,880
没人比我更了解
Look, nobody knows better than me

491
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,080
跟你爸共事是多闹心的事了
how impossible working with your father is.

492
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,870
他脾气坏  没耐心  不知感恩
He's moody, impatient, ungrateful,

493
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,910
而且还是个出了名的百事通
and the know-it-all problem is legendary.

494
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,560
他就在旁边  是吧
He's standing right there, isn't he?

495
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,290
如果他就在旁边  我还会这么说吗
Would I be saying all this if he were standing right here?

496
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,350
会啊
Yeah.

497
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,610
好吧  那你就自问自答了
Okay, so you answered your own question.

498
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,290
你是这地方的一分子
You're part of this place.

499
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,440
我们需要你
And we need you.

500
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,980
我爸爸听到了吗
Did my dad hear that?

501
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,050
是的
Yes, he did.

502
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,290
他知道这是实话
And he knows it's true.

503
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,780
跟他说  我们今晚见
Tell him I'll see him tonight.

504
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,010
我就当你是答应了
I'm gonna take that as a yes

505
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,980
我会通知锅贴团队
and inform the Potstickers.

506
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,200
再说吧
We'll see.

507
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,580
她说  今晚见你
She'll see you tonight.

508
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,340
她语气是很高兴的
What, did she say that in a -- in a nice way,

509
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,070
还是威胁的
or like a threatening way?

510
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,160
高兴
Nice.

511
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,380
这下完全不出气了
Now the air's not coming out at all.

512
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,920
-没事的  -怎么会没事  乔
- It's fine. - It's not fine, Joe.

513
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,160
别误会  机器人科技是很赞
Don't get me wrong, the bot technology is impressive.

514
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,410
但暴风雪已经在做类似的东西了
But Blizzard is already doing something similar,

515
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,330
原点也是
and so is Origin.

516
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,380
我在这方面是完全有竞争力的
And I can totally compete in that arena.

517
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,560
但能不能开辟全新的领域呢
But what about an entirely different arena?

518
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,700
如果把你的软件用在火星表面呢
What if your software was used on the surface of Mars?

519
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,960
或是在人体血流里
Or in the human bloodstream?

520
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,600
如果用露台去防卫免疫系统呢
What if Gazebo could be used to defend the immune system?

521
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,470
你跟我一样清楚
You know just as well as I do

522
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,760
你在钻研的技术
the technology you're working on

523
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,790
不会只存在于游戏里
isn't going to just live inside a game.

524
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,850
嗯  这
Yeah, and that's...

525
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,420
说起来轻松
a very easy thing to say.

526
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,830
-但我做游戏很久了...  -不
- But I've been working on games for a long ti-- - No,

527
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,740
我并不是假装
I don't mean to pretend

528
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,180
我知道未来会是什么样
that I know what it's all gonna look like.

529
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,150
我问你个私人问题好吗
Can I ask you a personal question?

530
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,790
说吧
Yes.

531
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,710
你和唐娜·埃默森是怎么回事
What's the deal with you and Donna Emerson?

532
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,870
你们在门罗互联网战略会议似乎针锋相对
Things seemed pretty prickly at M.I.S.C.

533
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,160
我知道你们曾是"穆特尼"的合作伙伴
I know you two worked together on "Mutiny."

534
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,900
是啊
We did.

535
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,560
后来呢
So what happened?

536
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,950
我们对公司前景的看法不同
We didn't share the same vision for our company.

537
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,950
她是想把你推出你的安全区吗
Did she try to push you out of your comfort zone?

538
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,600
别担心  你是远见家
Don't worry. You're the visionary.

539
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,970
我只是来确保你有你需要的一切
I'm just here to make sure you have everything you need.

540
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,720
圈地已经结束了  这我承认
Well, the land grab is over. I'll give you that.

541
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,840
这样能很好地
Well, this is a great way

542
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,410
把弱点变成强项
of turning a weakness into a strength.

543
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,350
在我的采访过程中  我发现人们
You know, in my interviews, I'm finding that people

544
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,170
大都害怕网络
are mostly just scared of the Web.

545
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,620
他们怕会迷失于其中
They're afraid they'll get lost in it.

546
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,740
我知道  所以我们要给他们个庇护所
Yeah, I know. That's why we'll give them shelter.

547
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,030
最终不非得是
I mean, the end game doesn't have to be

548
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,350
推出一个软件包
to get wrapped up in some software package.

549
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,560
可以是把彗星变成网上的一个家园
It can be to make Comet a home on the Internet.

550
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,370
我们可以整合搜索最多的项目
What if we took an aggregate of the top searches.

551
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,660
科特·柯本死时  我们搜索量暴增
When Kurt Cobain died, we were flooded with searches.

552
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,860
如果当初我们
How amazing would it have been if...

553
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,980
在网页最上面写点什么  那多棒啊
if we had a little write-up about it on the top of the page.

554
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,430
是啊  那是很棒
Yeah. That would have been great.

555
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,810
这让用户和内容之间的共生关系
It makes possible a truly symbiotic relationship

556
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,140
成为了可能
between user and content.

557
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,890
大家对网站感兴趣
People will be interested in the site

558
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,130
是因为网站对他们感兴趣
because the site is interested in them.

559
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,850
是啊  没错  所以我才那么激动啊
Yes, exactly. This is what I was getting so excited about.

560
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:57,550
-我们可以有娱乐  新闻  -运动
- We could have entertainment, news... - Sports.

561
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,920
运动
...sports, uh...

562
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,070
股市
stock market.

563
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:03,180
没错  我们是要把人送去其他网站
And, yeah, sure, we would deliver people to other sites,

564
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,910
但他们总会回到我们这里
but they always come back to us.

565
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,080
没错
Yes!

566
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,690
你还要鼓捣多久
How much longer is this gonna take?

567
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,370
马上了
Just two more seconds.

568
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,700
你和卡梅  真是的  对时间完全没概念
You and Cam, I swear to God -- no sense of time.

569
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,070
瞧  谁需要叫人啊
See? Who needs a guy, huh?

570
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,940
-谁需要叫人啊  -好了吗
- Who needs a guy?! - So, it's good?

571
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,170
-乔·麦克米伦  -卡梅伦·豪伊
- Joe MacMillan. - Cameron Howe.

572
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:38,270
你今晚要带我去哪吃饭
So where are you taking me to dinner tonight?

573
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,920
那个啊
About that, um...

574
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:47,680
阿莱克莎请我去吃饭了  我也答应了
Alexa invited me out for dinner, and I kind of said yes.

575
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,710
好吧
Okay.

576
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,460
我真抱歉
Yeah, I'm really sorry.

577
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,670
我知道我说过会带你去吃饭的
I -- I know I said that I'd take you out, but...

578
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,630
没事
Oh, it's okay.

579
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,660
刚跟戈登开始研究一个点子
Just got started on something with Gordon,

580
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,770
我很乐意继续做下去
and I'm happy to stick with it.

581
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,940
真的吗  那好
Really? Okay.

582
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,500
因为她要我见个人
Because she wanted me to meet this guy

583
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,400
他在斯坦福大学研究人机互动
who is working in human-computer interaction at Stanford,

584
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,620
我还没反应过来  她就邀请我们一起去吃饭了
and then before I knew it, she invited us both to dinner.

585
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,360
听起来你们谈得很好
Sounds like things went well.

586
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,690
其实  不是  她...
Actually, no. She was..

587
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,220
对我给她看的不以为然
a little underwhelmed by what I showed her.

588
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,350
什么
What?

589
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,160
是啊
Yeah, she, um...

590
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,910
她应该知道我的编程不错  但是
I mean, I think she knew the programming was good, but...

591
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,710
但她觉得我的构思小了
she said I was thinking a little small.

592
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,600
你有多久没听人说过这话了
When was the last time you heard that?

593
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,280
我不知道
I don't know.

594
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,710
好久没有了
It's been a while.

595
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,360
今晚开心点
Have fun tonight.

596
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,530
谢谢
Thank you.

597
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,520
你真好
You're great.

598
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,390
而且
For the record...

599
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,680
我想过在这里建个房子
I have thought about building a place out here.

600
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,420
再见
Bye.

601
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,580
我觉得"重新上线"更好
I think "re-launch" would be better.

602
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,980
真是"大"改变啊
That's a substantive change.

603
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,790
挽救了整个项目
Saved the whole project.

604
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,420
"上线"就包含了设计
Well, "launch" subsumes design.

605
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,340
谁说的
Says who?

606
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,070
你不重新设计  就不能重新上线
You can't re-launch something without redesigning it.

607
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,180
当然可以
Of course you can.

608
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,750
好吧  是可以  但你不会的
Okay, you can... but you wouldn't.

609
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,500
开心了
Happy?

610
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,700
是的
Yes.

611
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,580
好吧
All right.

612
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,360
天呐  我哪蹭的这么脏
Aw, jeez! Where'd I get so dirty?

613
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,630
时间过得怎么这么快
Where did the time go?

614
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,890
我一小时后约了跟凯蒂吃饭
I gotta meet Katie in an hour for dinner.

615
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,490
我们明天再聊这个吧
Maybe we should get into this tomorrow?

616
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,350
好吧
Oh. Okay.

617
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,300
没问题
Not a problem.

618
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,350
反正我15分钟就得走了  还何必
Well, I mean, what's the point in launching into something,

619
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,440
聊"上"这个呢
you know, when I gotta get out of here in 15?

620
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,960
说的是
Of course.

621
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,030
今天干得很好
Great work today.

622
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,680
你今晚带她去哪
Where are you taking her tonight?

623
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,230
不去哪  姑娘们要去看电影
Uh, nowhere. The girls are going to the movies,

624
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,920
所以我们要待在家
so we're gonna stay home.

625
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,900
不错啊  这是个好点子
Nice. It's a really good idea.

626
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,310
嗯  我知道
Yeah. I know it is.

627
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,820
-唐娜  -乔
- Donna. - Joe.

628
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,460
出什么事了吗
Is something wrong?

629
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,100
不不
No. No.

630
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,480
一切都好
Everything's fine.

631
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,110
一切都好  就是...
Everything's great. I just, um...

632
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:24,210
我希望你能跟我说明白一件事
I was hoping you could give me some clarity on something.

633
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,280
好吧   我...
Um, okay, well, I...

634
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,000
我自己也没多少"明白"  但是
don't have a lot clarity to spare, but...

635
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,750
你想问什么
what's on your mind?

636
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,640
你为什么要把
Why would you give us

637
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,800
有潜在价值的市场调查告诉我们
potentially useful market research?

638
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,140
你说什么
I'm sorry, what?

639
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,360
今早  你见到了戈登
This morning, you saw Gordon.

640
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:47,080
他回来时因为你给他的信息乐得跳脚
He came back hopped up on some information that you gave him.

641
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,880
用户量  访问时长
User numbers, length of visits.

642
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,410
你为什么要跟我们说这些
Why would you share that with us?

643
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,720
我为什么不能说
Well, why wouldn't I?

644
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,760
因为你是我们的竞争对手
Because you're our direct competition.

645
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,760
好吧  首先  我已经不负责流浪者了
Okay, well, first of all, I'm not on Rover anymore,

646
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,120
我不是你的对手了
so I'm not your competition.

647
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,580
-其次  -你说什么呢
- And, secondly... - What are you talking about?

648
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,980
你才去找过卡梅伦
You just came over to get Cameron

649
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,550
让她转让算法
to sign away the algorithm.

650
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,690
没办法  乔
What can I tell you, Joe?

651
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,850
事情变化是很快的
Shit changes fast.

652
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:11,140
如果你已经不负责项目了  又怎么知道数据的
If you're off the project, how did you get those numbers?

653
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,490
那是真的吗
Are they even real?

654
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,540
乔·麦克米伦的自尊啊  又喷发了
The old Joe MacMillan ego, just, I mean, volcanic.

655
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,240
你怎么想的
What do you think? I... I...

656
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,290
我还有时间坐在那儿阴谋设计害你吗
I have time to just sit around and, what, plot against you?

657
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,780
反正不会是第一次了
Wouldn't be the first time.

658
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,900
我保证  我才不在乎你们公司
I promise you I don't give a shit about your company.

659
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,980
我之所以曾对它有过那么一丝关心
The only reason I ever even cared a little bit

660
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,300
是因为我女儿原本在那里工作
was 'cause my daughter worked there,

661
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,520
现在她都不做了
and now that's not even true.

662
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,550
所以  我真的都不去想它了
So, really, I give it just no thought at all.

663
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,120
其实  海莉还在我们这儿工作
Actually, Haley does still work there.

664
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,640
我今天下午跟她通话了
I spoke to her this afternoon.

665
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,400
是吗
Did you?

666
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,540
是啊
Yeah.

667
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:46,780
她是一个我非常在乎的人
She happens to be someone I care about very much.

668
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,940
她好幸运  因为她可缺
Oh, well, lucky her 'cause she's so bereft

669
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,330
-在乎她的人了  -唐娜  听着
- of people that care about her. - Donna, look!

670
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,890
戈登和我要开始钻研一个新想法了
Gordon and I are getting started on a new idea

671
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,470
而这个想法来自你无心之言
that sprang from a whiff of a hint

672
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,230
激发的灵光一现
of a nothing comment you made,

673
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,770
我只想确定  将心比心地说
and I just want to be sure... human to human...

674
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:02,070
你不是在谋划着想坑我们
that you're not planning to do something to screw us.

675
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,940
天呐  你以为我是什么样的人啊
Jesus Christ! What kind of person do you think I am?

676
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,590
你想把我赶出浏览器的项目
You tried to get me kicked off the browser project.

677
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:10,510
你偷了我们网络索引的点子
You stole our idea for the Web index,

678
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,180
这还只是在加州的事
and those are just the California crimes.

679
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,270
别逼我提德州的事
Don't get me started on Texas.

680
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,940
好吧  你知道吗  你是对的
Okay, you know what? You're right.

681
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,550
我不是一个值得信任的人
I am not a trustworthy person.

682
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:21,320
所以你最好还是别再来找我了
The best thing you can do is to leave me the hell alone.

683
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,950
相信我  那样我再高兴不过了
Believe me, nothing would make me happier.

684
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:26,030
-很不幸  -天呐  你赢了
- Unfortunately... - Jesus Christ, you won!

685
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,400
好吗  你赢了
Okay, you won!

686
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,190
你有海莉  有戈登  有卡梅
You got Haley and Gordon and Cam.

687
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:35,230
你有所有人  你还想从我这儿要什么
You got everybody. What more do you want from me?

688
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,890
天呐
Oh, my God!

689
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,270
真没断吗
Sure they're not broken?

690
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,600
我确定
I'm pretty sure.

691
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,580
跟我说实话  你为什么不负责流浪者了
Level with me. How come you're off Rover?

692
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,430
说来话长
Oh, it's a long story.

693
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,800
但是简单说
But the short version...

694
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,520
不是我的决定
it wasn't up to me.

695
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,280
抱歉我那么咄咄逼人
Sorry I got in your face.

696
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,200
但也不该这么对我
I don't think I deserved this.

697
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,400
你得知道我不是故意的
You have to know I didn't do that on purpose.

698
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,700
唐娜  行了
Donna, come on.

699
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,130
我当然知道
Of course I do.

700
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,830
我也绝不会去干扰彗星的  真的
And I would never do anything to interfere with Comet, really.

701
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,340
我不是那样的人
I'm not that person.

702
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,380
就算没有海莉
Even if Haley weren't there, I...

703
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,230
我不会的
I just, I wouldn't.

704
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,270
唐娜  我懂的
Donna, I get it.

705
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,030
被人那么想很难受
It hurts to be thought of in that way.

706

他们走了
They are gone.

他们现在归环球航空公司操心了
They are TWA's problem now.

但是  不  不
But, no. No!

为什么
Why?!

45
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,460
保证我们以后绝对不会像他们那样看待彼此
Promise me we will never look at each other the way they do.

46
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,270
我保证不了
I can't promise.

47
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,610
对不起他们让你那么抓狂
Sorry they drive you so crazy.

48
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,910
你在说什么  他们人那么好
What are you talking about? They were great.

49
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,680
你看你爸爸给了我什么
You see what your dad got me?

50
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,860
能时刻提醒我
The perfect reminder

51
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,200
他觉得我有多娘
of how unmanly he thinks I am.

52
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,510
声音真尖
Screechy.

53
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,540
我们为什么还要改进
Yeah, why we need to improve upon a tool

54
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,280
一件已很好地服务了人类
that's been serving mankind brilliantly

55
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,410
几百万年的工具  我真不懂
for millions of years is beyond me.

56
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,530
我去
Damn.

57
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,250
这玩意真锋利
This baby's really sharp.

58
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,580
给我拿个旧靴子
Hey, give me an old boot.

59
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,750
看看这东西有多大能耐
Let's see what this thing can do.

60
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,440
别闹了  你会把她吵醒的
Stop it. ‭You're gonna wake her up.

61
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,670
好吧
Oh, fine.

62
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,700
每次我妈妈手里拿着夏敦埃时
I'm always amazed at what my mom can do

63
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,510
都能做出很多让我意想不到的事
with a glass of Chardonnay in her hand.

64
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,980
她都能加入马戏团了
She could join the circus.

65
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,120
你觉得他们玩得开心吗
Hey, you think they had fun?

66
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,980
开心
Yeah.

67
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,970
我不确定我妈妈喜不喜欢这幢楼
I'm not sure my mom approved of the building,

68
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,960
还有周围环境什么的  但是
or the neighborhood for that matter, but...

69
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,110
她就只在乎体面
you know, it's all about appearances to her.

70
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,540
你听到你爸爸怎么说
Yeah. And did you hear what your dad said

71
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,650
那些种花生的农民
about the peanut farmer

72
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,780
和关于节能的抨击吗
and his whole ‭energy-conservation diatribe?

73
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,560
不  没有  我听不下去
No, don't. I can't.

74
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,620
还说我们应该住在
Or the line about how we should live in an area

75
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,020
房东比租客多的地方
with more homeowners than renters.

76
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,650
你知道那是什么意思吧
You know what that's code for.

77
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,440
至少他们跟琼妮处得挺好
Well...at least they're good with Joanie.

78
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,410
你妈妈跟她处得非常好
Your mom is great with her.

79
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,760
我爸爸也是
Well, so is my dad.

80
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,920
他的确不打孩子  如果你是这个意思的话
I mean, he didn't strike the child, if that's what you mean.

81
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,740
他还不会在她脑袋边上放烟花
Yeah, he also managed not to set off any fireworks next to her head.

82
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,520
就那么一个火箭瓶
It was one bottle rocket.

83
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,260
天啊  你有没有看到琼妮吐在他那件
Oh, my God. ‭Did you see the look on his face

84
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,540
有特殊意义的独立日短袖衫上时他的表情
when Joanie spit up ‭on his special 4th of July Polo?

85
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,090
她算是帮了那件短袖衫个忙
She was doing that shirt a favor.

86
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,770
他想帮忙  只是不知道该怎么做
He tries to help. He just doesn't always know how.

87
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,010
提出要给我们买一幢在达拉斯的房子
Offering to buy us a house as long as it's in Dallas.

88
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,690
别这样  接受一点他们的帮助
Come on. I mean, would it be the worst thing in the world

89
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,110
也没有那么糟糕吧
if we had a little bit of help?

90
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,800
我们不需要帮助
We don't need help.

91
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,100
为什么  你想永远住在这里吗
Why? Do you want to live here forever?

92
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,080
唐娜  我们不会永远住在这里的
Look, Donna, we are not gonna live here forever, okay?

93
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,710
我们会造出东西  造出一台机器
Okay, we're gonna build something, a machine, okay?

94
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,940
我们要一起卖出个好价钱
And we're gonna sell it together.

95
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,310
是吗  那得等到猴年马月
Oh, yeah? And when are we gonna do that?

96
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,420
照顾孩子  换尿布
Between nursing and changing diapers

97
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,990
而且只有我才能哄她睡觉
and being the only one that can get the baby to sleep,

98
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,310
我觉得我未来没多少时间
I don't really see a whole lot of time for

99
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,260
去造电脑
building computers in my future.

100
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,790
不会一直那样的
Yeah, well, it's not always gonna be like that.

101
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,430
-是吗  -是啊
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

102
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,770
什么会变呢
What's gonna change?

103
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,270
我不知道  所有东西吧
I don't know. I mean, everything.

104
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,800
希望吧  因为我可不想下半辈子
Well, I hope so, 'cause I don't want to be breastfeeding

105
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,310
都在哺乳和洗碗中度过
and doing dishes the rest of my life.

106
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,310
这才三个月
Look, it's been three months.

107
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,160
在德州  我这时都能去上班了
Well, in Texas, ‭I'd be freed up to go to work,

108
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,850
你也是
and so would you.

109
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,120
我们不是真要讨论搬回德州的事吧
We're not actually talking about moving back to Texas right now.

110
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,420
我妈妈说如果我们想...
My mom said that if we wanted --

111
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,420
你和你妈妈谈过这件事吗
You've been talking to your mom about this?

112
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,640
你们有什么计划吗
Well -- What, are you guys making plans?

113
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,310
没有  只是...随便聊聊  假设的
No, just...in broad, hypothetical terms.

114
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,970
不不不  唐娜  听我说
N-no, no, no, Donna! Listen to me!

115
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,400
这一行的关键就是我们的人脉
This industry is all about who we know,

116
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,220
如果我们离开了  就什么都没了
and if we leave, we'll miss it.

117
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,310
那不叫帮助  那叫...
Okay. That's not help. Okay. That's --

118
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,760
那叫缓慢地扼杀我们
That's offering to kill us slowly.

119
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,450
-那是死刑  -不  他们只是...
- That's a death sentence. - No, they just --

120
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,760
他们只是觉得我们现在过得很困难
They're seeing that we're struggling is all.

121
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,580
我会更努力的  我会帮忙的
Well, I'll do more, okay? I-I-I'll help!

122
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,400
是吗
Oh, yeah?

123
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,840
每次宝宝哭  你就把她交给我
Every time the baby cries, you hand her back to me.

124
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,550
好吧  我不再那么做了
Okay. Well, I won't do that.

125
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,010
不仅仅是那样
Well, it's not just that.

126
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,530
我担心她
It's -- I'm concerned about everything

127
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,930
见到吃到碰到的一切
that she sees and eats and touches.

128
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,780
你还在她脑袋边放烟花
And you -- you're exploding fireworks next to her head.

129
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,620
天啊
Oh, my God.

130
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,020
唐娜  不就是那一个破火箭瓶吗
Donna, it was one ‭goddamn bottle rocket, okay?

131
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,360
如果你想走
Look, if you want to leave,

132
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,970
那咱们现在就收拾东西
let's just pack everything up right now.

133
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:13,670
不  我说真的
No, I'm serious!

134
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,170
咱们马上打包行李
Let's pack everything up right now,

135
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,400
搬回德州  然后我找个工作
and we'll move back to Texas, and I'll go get a job

136
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,530
给你爸的哪个哥们打工
working for one of your dad's friends,

137
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,890
这样你就能天天陪你妈打高尔夫
and you can go play golf with your mom every day.

138
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,070
你以为这就是我想要的吗
That's what you think I want?

139
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,300
我不知道你想要什么
I don't know what the hell you want.

140
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,370
昨天  还是我
Okay, yesterday it was -- it was me

141
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,240
在旧金山  闯出一番事业来
and -- and San Francisco and building something,

142
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,520
然后今天  我真是搞不懂
and today, I -- I don't have a clue!

143
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,780
你太过分了
You are being so mean right now.

144
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,710
我只希望我们能先停下来好好想想
I would just like us to stop and think

145
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,870
然后再着手去做什么事
about one thing we do before we do it.

146
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,600
你怀了孕  我们就结了婚
I mean, we got -- we got pregnant and then married,

147
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,510
然后日子就成了这样
and then we got this whole life...

148
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,970
而我们过成这样  我完全没有发言权
and I feel like I haven't made any of the decisions to get us here.

149
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,970
你还觉得你没有发言权
Oh, you feel like you didn't make any decisions?

150
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,170
是我单膝跪地向你求的婚吗
Was I the one who got down on one knee and proposed to you?

151
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,550
天啊
Oh, God.

152
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,930
看来还得我去照顾她
I guess I'll go get her, then.

153
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,840
不用  让她哭去吧
No, just let her cry!

154
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,650
妈妈来了  没事了
Mommy's here. It's okay.

155
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,810
我知道
I know.

156
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,320
我知道  我知道
I know, I know.

157
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,890
没事的
It's okay.

158
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,920
宝宝乖
baby.

159
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,260
没事了
It's okay.

160
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,520
你想要小象吗
You want your little elephant? Huh?

161
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,160
好了  没事的
Yeah. It's not so bad.

162
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,790
没关系的
It's not so bad.

163
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,240
没事了
Okay.

164
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,730
我不明白急个什么劲
I don't understand what the rush is.

165
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,290
我急是因为我想趁早把事情办了
The rush is I want to get this over with.

166
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,290
我可不想三天两头地往这儿跑
I don't want to be making a million trips back here.

167
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,800
所以有什么想要的  今天就拿走
So, whatever you want, you should get today.

168
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,600
等等
Hold on.

169
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,900
大件的家具  我们搬不动的
So, for big stuff, furniture we can't move ourselves,

170
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,380
贴绿点就留下  红点就捐了
green means keep, red means donate.

171
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,270
-明白吗  绿的留  红的扔  -明白
- Okay? Green, yes, red, no. - Okay. Got it.

172
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,360
从你们自己的房间开始吧
Start in your rooms.

173
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,100
别忘了你们的作业  课本
Don't forget all your schoolwork, textbooks.

174
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,010
孩子们
Hey, guys?

175
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,990
我爱你们
I love you.

176
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,970
也爱你
Love you, too.

177
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,100
我爱你
I love you.

178
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,570
好吧
Okay.

179
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,810
你们好啊
Hey, guys.

180
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,410
孩子们还好吗
How are the girls doing?

181
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,310
问得真傻  大家当然都不好
That's a stupid question. We're all doing terrible.

182
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,240
大家都很伤心
Everyone's terrible.

183
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,520
你还好吗
How are you doing?

184
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,180
也就那样
You know.

185
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,420
多谢你们来帮忙
thanks for helping out. It's...

186
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,620
没事的
Of course.

187
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,260
葬礼  真的很感人
‭The service...was beautiful.

188
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,800
是啊
Yeah.

189
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,870
你的悼词也很感人
I thought what you said was really nice.

190
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,340
你有留备份吗
Do you have a copy of that?

191
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,330
我想给孩子们留着
I'd love to save it for the girls.

192
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,060
我有
I do.

193
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,430
谢谢
Thanks.

194
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,000
我想说葬礼真的太感人了
I wanted to say how beautiful the service was.

195
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,510
真的很受触动
Like, really personal.

196
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,480
谢谢
Thanks.

197
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,770
那么
So, what,

198
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,500
我们从哪开始
where would you like us to start?

199
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,570
这个还真是
Yeah, God, it's, uh...

200
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,420
有点说不清楚
kind of hard to figure out.

201
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,350
要不你来打包戈登的衣柜吧
Maybe you could tackle Gordon's closet?

202
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,130
就是把衣服装进垃圾袋里准备捐给好心二手店
Just, you know, throw his clothes in garbage bags for Goodwill.

203
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:45,920
好吧
Yes.

204
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,390
那我从厨房着手吧
I'm gonna start in the kitchen.

205
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,070
如果你能把这里的东西都打包起来
If you wanted to pack up everything in here,

206
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,170
那就太好了
that'd be great.

207
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,060
好的
Yeah.

208
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,480
这些画还是都给孩子们留下吧
I'd just, you know, keep all the pictures for the girls, I think.

209
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,920
她们将来会想要的
They'll probably want them eventually.

210
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,310
当然  好的
Of course. Yeah, right.

211
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,870
你能放首歌吗
Could you put something on?

212
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:26,900
什么
What?

213
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,890
就是太安静了  随便放首就行
Oh, it's too quiet. Just something, anything?

214
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,520
好
Yeah, uh...yeah.

215
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,710
抱歉  就是觉得没合适的
I don't know. Sorry. Nothing feels right.

216
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,080
这个就很好
This is perfect.

217
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:46,610

He loved this one.

220
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,710
这是我们在加兰市的南瓜地里拍的
This is from when we went to that pumpkin patch in Garland.

221
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,970
你能相信有那么一段时间
Can you believe there was a time

222
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,210
你对南瓜是那么着迷吗
that you got this excited about pumpkins?

223
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,720
我还是很喜欢南瓜啊
I still get excited about pumpkins.

224
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,750
南瓜最让我开心了
Pumpkins blow my mind.

225
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,490
其实你什么都不用扔的
You know, you don't have to get rid of anything.

226
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,400
你可以打包整个房间
You could just... pack up your whole room.

227
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,640
不  我只是不知道从哪里开始
No, it's just, I don't know where to start.

228
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,790
你需要帮忙吗
You need some help?

229
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,320
嗯
Yeah.

230
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,680
那我们从衣服开始  比较简单
Let's start with your clothes. That's easy.

231
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,180
好
Okay.

232
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,340
天呐
Oh, man.

233
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,680
所有都打包吗
So, just everything?

234
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,720
好吧
Yeah. I think so.

235
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,500
这是什么
What's this?

236
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,220
南加州大学
USC?

237
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,030
西北大学
Northwestern?

238
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,260
这些是什么  是备份件吗
What are these? Are these duplicates?

239
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,900
你递交了大学申请吧
You did send in your applications?

240
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,650
我现在不想谈这个  行吗
I don't want to talk about this right now, okay?

241
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,950
我们现在就谈
We are talking about this.

242
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,520
我们现在就得谈
We're talking about this right now.

243
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,690
你去哪里
Where are you going?

244
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,860
别管我
Leave me alone.

245
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,330
你告诉我们你递交了申请
You told us that you sent these.

246
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,340
怎么了
What's going on?

247
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,680
我没有
Well, I didn't.

248
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,400
我们可以私下里谈吗
Can we talk about this privately? Please?

249
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,240
为什么  怎么了
Why? Why?

250
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,880
为什么不在这里  为什么不让他们看到
Why not here? Huh? Why don't you let them see?

251
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,060
怎么  你害怕他们会怎么想吗
Why? Are you afraid of what they might think?

252
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,250
够了  我们出去
That's enough. Let's go outside.

253
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,090
不  让他们看看我们是多么乱套
No! Let them see what a mess we've been!

254
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,480
我们真的很乱套
And we have been.

255
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,640
我不知道你为什么这样做
I don't know why you're doing this.

256
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,910
你爸爸会很难过的
Your father would be -- he'd be devastated.

257
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,070
那幸好他现在不在  不会看到了
Well, it's a good thing that he's not here to see it, then.

258
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,940
这
That's...

259
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,590
你怎么能说出这种话
That is...that's a horrible thing to say.

260
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,640
你等了多长时间才拿爸爸来压我
How long did it take you to use Dad against me?

261
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,570
十天吗
Like 10 days?

262
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,920
我很惊讶你能坚持那么久
I'm surprised that you could hold out that long.

263
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,030
你
You are...

264
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,010
有时候  我都不认识你了
Sometimes I don't even know who you are anymore.

265
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,700
我们都受了伤  都很难受
We're all hurting. We're all upset.

266
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,770
你知道什么
What do you know?

267
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,160
你都不能忍受他
You couldn't even stand him.

268
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,080
乔运走了第一批东西
Joe took the first load.

269
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,040
你闻到了没
Do you smell that?

270
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,150
香烟味
Cigarette smoke.

271
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,230
我要宰了她
I'm gonna kill her.

272
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,730
她就是想激怒你
She wants to piss you off.

273
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,590
我17岁时也会这么干
Okay? It's the exact same thing I would've done when I was 17.

274
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,320
我十几岁的时候也够逆反了  但这...
I did my fair share of teenage bullshit, but this is --

275
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,800
她故意这么混蛋的  你就让她混蛋
She wants to be a jerk. Just let her be a jerk.

276
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,370
我不知道这个词足不足以形容
I don't know that ‭that's a strong enough word

277
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,710
她现在这副样子
for what she's being.

278
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,290
她居然朝我发火
I mean, she lost it at me.

279
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,090
明明是她没有递交申请
She's the one who didn't send them in.

280
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,130
是啊
Yeah.

281
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,920
我觉得这种情况下讲道理未必能
I don't know if reason's gonna be that helpful to you

282
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,390
帮到你  或是她
in this situation... or her.

283
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,570
或许我不该提起戈登的
Probably shouldn't have brought up Gordon.

284
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,920
或许吧
Probably not.

285
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,700
难道不是她显然不尊重我...
I mean, was it not clear that she disrespected me or --

286
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,890
能让我跟她谈谈吗
Could I talk to her?

287
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,240
可以
Yeah.

288
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,850
告诉她她很混蛋
Tell her she's being an asshole.

289
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,690
不要开门
Do not open the door.

290
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,800
干得漂亮
Really good one.

291
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,410
你妈现在完全气疯了
Your mom's totally freaking out right now.

292
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,520
是啊
Yeah.

293
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,450
虽然不是很巧妙
You don't get a million points for subtlety,

294
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,020
但是  确实非常有效
but still, it's very effective.

295
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,180
我没打算干什么  我只是需要抽支烟
I wasn't trying to do anything. I just needed a smoke.

296
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,400
你怎么样了
What's up?

297
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,150
有人吗
Hello?

298
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,090
在这儿
In here.

299
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,020
人都去哪了
Where is everyone?

300
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,910
远远地分散在房子的各个角落里
Scattered to the far corners of the house,

301
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,410
躲着我  或是躲着我
some avoiding me, others also avoiding me.

302
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,000
我是闻到烟味儿了吗
Do I smell cigarettes smoke?

303
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,030
是的
You do.

304
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,340
是琼妮
Joanie?

305
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,360
你感觉怎么样
How are you holding up?

306
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,020
搞什么
What the hell?

307
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,820
宝贝  怎么了
Sweetie, what's wrong?

308
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,700
爸爸的衣服在哪
Dad's clothes, where are they?

309
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,600
我刚从好心二手店回来
Oh, I just got back from Goodwill.

310
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,980
宝贝  怎么了  告诉我
Honey, what's wrong? Talk to me.

311
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,090
爸爸的毛衣  我本想自己留着的  但...
Dad's s-sweater, I wanted to keep it, but...

312
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,370
绿色的那件  没关系
It's the green one. It doesn't matter.

313
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,830
我...算了
I'll... Forget it.

314
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,600
不  不  我刚从那儿回来
No, no. I just got back.

315
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,760
你想要你爸的毛衣
You want your dad's sweater?

316
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,020
我们去拿回来
We're gonna go get it.

317
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,370
来啊
Come on.

318
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,100
我敢说比起我不上大学这件事
I bet she's more upset about the fact

319
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,800
她更不爽的是要告诉她的朋友们
that she has to tell her friends I'm not going to college

320
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,550
我不打算去上大学了
than the fact that I'm not going.

321
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,650
琼妮  别这样  你知道不是这样的
Joanie, come on. You know that's not true.

322
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,340
她就只在乎体面
Everything's appearances with her.

323
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,060
"看我完美的房子  完美的泳池
"Look at my perfect house and my perfect pool

324
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,680
还有我两个完美的女儿"
and my perfect daughters."

325
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,800
你知道她还熨她的牛仔裤吗
Did you know she irons her jeans?

326
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,490
好吧
Okay.

327
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,910
别说你无法收回的话
Don't say things you can't take back.

328
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,480
你得饶过她这一回
I need you to give her a break.

329
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,950
饶过她吗
Give her a break?

330
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,170
是的  知道为什么吗
Yeah. You know why?

331
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:57,380
你很难搞懂  因为你是个混蛋
You're hard to navigate because you're a dick.

332
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,650
我可以这么说  因为我也是个混蛋
And I say that because I'm a dick.

333
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,850
我是个大混蛋
I'm, like, huge.

334
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,150
混蛋之王
I'm Queen Big Dick. Like...

335
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,750
好吧  这么说很怪  但是
That sounded weird, but...

336
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,260
-是啊  -重点是  你俩
- Yeah. - ...the point is, you two...

337
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,230
尽量去理解你妈妈的立场
Just try and understand where your mom's coming from.

338
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,860
当然  反过来也是
And vice versa, of course!

339
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,980
但是  我像你这么大时
But, look, when I was your age,

340
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,620
也把我妈妈赶出了我的生活
I cut my mom out of my life, and...

341
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,590
你不想那么做的
you don't want to do that.

342
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,820
我当时有充分理由的
I mean, I had a good reason to.

343
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,930
我妈妈状况很糟
My mom was a mess.

344
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,310
她错过了我的毕业典礼
Like, missed my graduation

345
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,340
因为她喝了太多漱口水  就那么糟
'cause she drank too much mouthwash kind of a mess.

346
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,380
但还是
But still...

347
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,340
这些时光你要不回来的
It's time you can't get back.

348
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,740
我可以跟你住
I could stay with you.

349
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,080
我们俩住我的铁罐子吗
The two of us in my tin can?

350
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,190
是啊  我可以再买个拖车  开去那里
Yeah. I could get another trailer and take it out there.

351
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,460
那多赞
It'd be awesome.

352
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,630
琼妮
Joanie...

353
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,130
我连株植物都照顾不好
I mean, I can't even take care of a plant.

354
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,840
我不需要人照顾的
I don't need to be taken care of.

355
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,590
天呐
God.

356
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,940
大家都觉得我什么都做不好
Everyone looks at me like I can't do anything for myself,

357
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,700
-当我是小婴儿  -好吧  对不起
- like I'm in diapers. - Okay. I'm sorry.

358
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,030
我不是那个意思的
That -- That's really not what I meant.

359
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,830
我就是说
I just mean...

360
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,530
这就是为什么大学很棒
This is why college is so great.

361
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:15,090
你可以去那里  第一次独立生活
You get to go and be by yourself for the first time,

362
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,350
你可以做任何你想做的事
you can do whatever you want to do,

363
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,580
抽什么都行
smoke whatever you want to smoke,

364
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,280
学习让你感兴趣的东西
learn about the things that interest you,

365
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,540
如果你还不知道你对什么感兴趣
and if you don't know what those are,

366
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,290
也能去搞个明白
you -- you get to figure it out.

367
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,310
这是完美的...
I mean, it's the perfect --

368
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,320
我知道
I know.

369
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,130
我知道
I know.

370
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,190
你想听点什么吗
You want to put something on?

371
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,700
什么
What?

372
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,690
你不非得自己听自己的
You don't have to listen to your thing.

373
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,920
可以用立体声听
You can play it on the stereo.

374
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,090
不  你不会喜欢的
No. You wouldn't like it.

375
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,700
我没那么老啦
I'm not that old.

376
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:51,800
放吧
Put it on.

377
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,400
谈得怎么样
How'd it go?

378
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,200
挺好  她挺好的
Good. She's coolly awesome.

379
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,750
还拿走了这个
Managed to swipe these.

380
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,490
这是戈登奶奶的
These are Gordon's grandmother's.

381
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,810
打算留给姑娘们的
Gonna save them for the girls.

382
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,130
天呐  我总那么说
Christ, I keep saying that.

383
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,550
我都不知道她们会不会在意这些东西
I don't even know if they'll care about any of this stuff.

384
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:34,510
她们会的
They will.

385
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,410
也或者  她们会把它装进盒子里
Yeah, or they'll just... put them in a box,

386
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,230
放进阁楼里  等她们死后
put the box in the attic, and then, when they die,

387
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,430
她们的孩子会把东西拿出来说
their kids will pull it out and say,

388
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,510
"把这个留给孩子们好了"
"I guess we should save this for our kids."

389
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,900
是啊  这么说来
Yeah, that's, uh...

390
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,790
好黑暗
pretty dark.

391
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,660
我通关了游戏
I finished the game.

392
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,070
什么游戏
What game?

393
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,200
你的游戏《朝圣者》
Your game, "Pilgrim."

394
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,030
你真通关了
You "finished it" finished it?

395
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,280
是啊  可算  你做得够难的
Yeah, finally. You made it hard enough.

396
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,150
是啊  我是为你这样的人做的
Yeah, I made it for people like you.

397
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,270
很不幸  你这样的人不多了
Unfortunately, there aren't many people like you anymore.

398
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,770
我喜欢结尾
Well, I liked the way it ended.

399
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,680
朝圣者是个孩子
The pilgrim was a kid.

400
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:33,310
是啊  朝圣者是个孩子
Yeah, the pilgrim was a kid.

401
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,230
谢谢你玩
Thank you for playing it.

402
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,210
对我意义重大
Yeah, it means a lot.

403
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,790
在医院  博斯那事
At the hospital, with Bos,

404
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,490
我当时的话  不是真心的
what I said, I-I-I didn't mean it.

405
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:56,330
唐娜  没事  我都不记得你说了什么
Please, Donna, I don't even remember what you said.

406
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,230
嗯
Uh, yeah.

407
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,830
我就是说
I just mean that I, you know...

408
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,710
我当时迷迷瞪瞪的
me, I've been in such a fog.

409
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,340
我都记不得自己的名字了  更别提...
I can't even remember my own name, let alo--

410
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,370
嗯  我也是
Yeah, no. Me too.

411
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,010
我去再拿个盒子来
I'm gonna, uh, go get another box.

412
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,320
我们走吧
Let's just go.

413
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,150
不是
No.

414
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,850
这个  是这件吗
Oh, here. Is this it?

415
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,790
不是
No.

416
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,240
你们不能这么干  怎么...
You can't be doing that. What...

417
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,170
不是
No.

418
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,970
我们一小时前才送来的
We just dropped these off an hour ago.

419
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,130
我们错放了一件进来
We, uh, put something in here by mistake.

420
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,140
你送来的就是我们的东西了
Well, once you drop it off, it's our property.

421
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,060
我无法核实哪个是谁的
You know, I have no way of verifying what's what or...

422
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,730
-这些是T恤衫  -之类的
- These are just T-shirts. - ...or who's whatever and so on.

423
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,750
走吧
Let's go.

424
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,270
好吧  这些衣服是我一个朋友的
Okay. These clothes belonged to a friend of mine,

425
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,430
他已经离世了
and he's no longer with us.

426
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,590
我们只想找一件衣服
There's exactly one item of clothing that we're looking for.

427
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,950
我们送来了九个袋子
We dropped off nine bags.

428
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,100
这里只有八个袋子
There's only eight here.

429
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,080
那件毛衣就在第九个袋子里  我们必须找到它
That sweater's in the ninth bag, and we just have to find it.

430
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,190
这里的东西都曾经是谁的
Yeah, I mean, all this stuff belonged to somebody, man.

431
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:18,800
那个
There it is.

432
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:20,940
那是我们的包
That's our bag right there.

433
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,910
你怎么能知道  你无法确定
How could you know that? You can't know that.

434
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,910
看那个包  再看看这几个
Look at that bag! Now look at these bags.

435
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,440
好吧  都是垃圾袋
Okay. They look like trash bags, man.

436
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,850
我不知道该说什么好
I-I-I don't know what to tell you.

437
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,360
-对不起  -那是我们的包
- I'm sorry. - That's our bag!

438
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,220
这是公司政策  哥们
It's just, this is company policy, man.

439
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,120
我也没办法
I don't know what to say.

440
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,450
我们走吧
Let's go.

441
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,820
规矩就这样
It is what it is, man.

442
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,660
你有学习驾照吧
You've got your learner's permit, right?

443
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,980
嗯
Yeah.

444
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,680
把车开过来  别熄火
Pull the truck up. Keep it running.

445
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,000
好
Okay.

446
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,070
你还好吗
How you doing?

447
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,030
很好
Super.

448
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,730
你要出远门吗
Are you going somewhere?

449
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,180
我要搬走了
I'm moving.

450
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,680
我在西雅图有几个朋友
Got some friends in Seattle.

451
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,380
我要去试试  据说很棒的
I'm gonna give that a try. They say it's great.

452
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,820
嗯  听说那里很不错的
Yeah, yeah, I heard it's, um...A whole scene.

453
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:22,840
是啊
Yeah.

454
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,320
我不知道你要走了
I didn't know you were going.

455
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,230
我几天前跟乔和大家说了
I told Joe and everybody a couple days ago.

456
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,420
我...是临时决定的
I, uh... Sort of a quick decision.

457
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,590
很抱歉  我
I -- I'm sorry that I --

458
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,760
不能为了乔留下  但是
I couldn't stick it out there, for Joe's sake, but, um...

459
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,450
彗星实在有太多戈登的痕迹
There's just too much of Gordon there at Comet,

460
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:44,260
这里到处都是戈登的痕迹
and there's too much of Gordon everywhere here.

461
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,340
嗯
Yeah.

462
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,490
听上去还不赖的
Hey, you know, doesn't, uh, sound that bad.

463
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,550
一车的东西  重新开始
Car full of stuff, a clean slate...

464
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,220
大概吧
I suppose.

465
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,490
我之前换过好几次地方
I've pinballed around a bunch.

466
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,040
加入彗星时
When I landed at Comet,

467
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,570
我以为那种日子过去了
I thought that maybe I was done with all that, but...

468
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,030
或许能在西雅图待下来
perhaps Seattle will stick.

469
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,420
你知道它会怎么样吗
Do you know what's gonna happen with it?

470
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,670
彗星啊
Oh, Comet. Uh...

471
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,940
乔应该会继续下去
I -- I think Joe will, you know, carry it on.

472
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,290
应该吧
I guess.

473
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,710
希望是这样
I hope so.

474
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,570
他真的很喜欢那里
He really loves it.

475
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,490
他失去了这么多
With everything he's lost,

476
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,700
再失去它就太遗憾了
it'd be a shame if that went, too.

477
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,510
是啊
Yeah.

478
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,640
我要进去了
I'm gonna go inside.

479
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,830
快走  快走
Go, go! Let's go!

480
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,080
干什么啊  哥们
Come on, man!

481
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,100
快走  快走
Go, go! Go, go, go!

482
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,930
我去啊
Holy shit.

483
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:24,030
我可能  拿错包了
Possible that I -- I got the wrong bag.

484
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:27,210
我们可不能回去了
Well, I -- I don't think we can go back.

485
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,280
我觉得你可能会想拿走这个
I, uh...thought you might want to have this, so, uh...

486
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,650
是啊  我们很开心的
Uh, yeah, we had a lot of fun.

487
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,800
戈登什么都愿做
Gordon was up for anything.

488
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,830
这你当然最清楚了
I mean, I don't have to tell you.

489
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,090
是啊
Yeah.

490
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:18,010
他对你  很疯狂
Well, he was just... crazy about you.

491
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:25,320
葬礼办得很感人
It was a beautiful service, by the way.

492
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,880
是啊  我也觉得是
Yeah. Yeah, I thought so, too.

493
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:34,320
如果这里有什么
Hey, uh, if there's anything here

494
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,710
你想拿走的
that you'd like to have,

495
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,160
你...别客气
you should, you know, please feel free.

496
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,340
谢谢
Oh, uh, thanks.

497
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:46,530
我并不喜欢他的装修风格
I don't...really like his decorating style.

498
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,670
我从没跟他说过
I never told him that.

499
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:54,020
你上辈子是牧童咋的
It's, like, were you a vaquero in a past life or something?

500
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,310
是啊  他好像
Yeah, I think, uh --

501
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,240
是找了个装修设计师
I think he had a decorator do it --

502
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,460
那人偏爱纳瓦霍毯子
a decorator with a fetish for Navajo blankets.

503
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,060
你知道我喜欢哪张照片吗
You know what picture I love?

504
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,290
有张你俩的特别好的照片
There's this great one of the two of you.

505
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,070
你们很年轻  我也不知道是多大
You're young, and I don't know how old,

506
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:17,090
但你们都拿着啤酒
but you're both holding beers and...

507
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,410
戈登的鬓角很狂野
Gordon's got these wild sideburns.

508
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,330
我知道那张
Yeah, yeah, I know it.

509
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:26,840
你俩看上去都一副...
You both look like -- oh, man -- like -- like,

510
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,340
"世界  小心了"的样子
"Look out, world."

511
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,400
我们在一起后  我就有种
As soon as we got together, I got very, you know,

512
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:40,760
"他是我的  我希望他只属于我
"That's mine. I want him all to myself.

513
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,790
我想要全部的戈登"的感觉
I want all the Gordon there is."

514
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,950
但你已经拥有了很多的他
But you already had so much of him...

515
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,610
你拥有  胆大包天的鬓角戈登
You had... Hell-raising sideburns Gordon

516
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,600
天知道还有什么
and who knows what else.

517
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,580
这让我嫉妒
And it made me jealous.

518
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,030
好吧
Well...

519
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,190
我也不知道我在说什么
I don't -- I don't know what I'm saying.

520
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,780
该死的  戈登  怎么回事啊
Goddamn, Gordon, what the hell?

521
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:13,710
我就不打扰你了
Well, I'm gonna... get out of your hair.

522
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,850
谢谢
Thank you.

523
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:20,050
琼妮在她房间  你想去打个招呼吗
Joanie's, uh, up in her room if you wanted to say hi.

524
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:24,530
但是  最好小心点
But I would, um... proceed with caution.

525
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,450
谢谢  我会小心的
Thanks. I'll be careful.

526
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,460
乔去了好一会儿了
Joe's been gone for a while, huh?

527
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,530
是啊  或许他们停车去吃饭了
Yeah, maybe they stopped to get something to eat.

528
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,800
这是好事  海莉该离开这儿一会儿
That's good. Haley needs to get out of here for a little while.

529
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,190
乔跟她处得真好
Joe's been so great with her.

530
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,820
你想要这个奇怪的神父雕像吗
Hey, uh, did you want the weird priest statues or...?

531
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,270
我家里已经有好多了
You know, I already have so many of them at home.

532
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,410
我总是忘记乔跟姑娘们处得多好
I always forget how good Joe is with the girls.

533
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,390
特别会逗她们开心
Just really lights them right up.

534
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,320
因为我们是一个团队
Because we're a team.

535
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,000
抱歉
Sorry.

536
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,330
你没事吧
You okay?

537
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,950
我就是在这里发现他的  我走了
This is where I found him. I'm gonna go.

538
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,330
谁啊
Hello?

539
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,650
进来
Come in.

540
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,410
博斯来了  他带了食物来
Bos just showed up. He brought food.

541
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,570
妈妈要我来看看你需不需要帮助
Mom wanted me to see if you needed any help.

542
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:34,450
我并不想要这些东西
I don't really want any of this stuff.

543
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,450
只想拿我的CD和照片
Just my CDs and my pictures.

544
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,270
怎么了
What?

545
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:46,820
怎么了
What?

546
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,660
你为什么不申请大学
Why didn't you apply to college?

547
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,070
我反正也进不去
Well, I wasn't gonna get into any of them.

548
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,040
你打算干什么
What are you gonna do?

549
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,990
我不知道
I don't know.

550
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,200
我会想清楚的
I'll figure it out.

551
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,000
捐了你
Donating you.

552
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,130
你试试看
Like to see you try.

553
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,210
至少他们还有你
At least they have you.

554
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,200
完全跟他们期待的一样
Exactly what they want in every way.

555
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,440
也不是完全一样
Well, not every way.

556
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,840
过来
Come here.

557
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,720
傻瓜
Dummy.

558
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,950
你不会也离开吧
You're not gonna go away, too, are you?

559
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,240
乔  你尝过我的辣椒酱吗
Joe, you ever have my chili?

560
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,360
我不知道
Oh, I don't know.

561
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,880
这是博斯沃思的家族菜谱  代代相传的
It's an old Bosworth family recipe, handed down.

562
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,760
秘密在于肉桂  真的
The secret's in the cinnamon. Yeah.

563
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,480
你要把肉桂
See, what you do is, you take that cinnamon,

564
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,210
放在橱柜里
and you put it in the cupboard

565
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,420
远离你的辣椒
and keep it away from your chili

566
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,390
因为它根本就不该出现在辣椒酱里
'cause it got no damn business being there in the first place.

567
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:46,080
我记得
You know, I remember...

568
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,500
我以前都没注意过戈登
I didn't really even notice Gordon

569
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:55,480
直到他开始跟你们做"巨人"电脑
until he started working on "the Giant" with y'all.

570
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,190
我以前喊他汤渍
I used to call him Soup Stain...

571
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,330
-因为他总是...  -我不能...
- ...'cause he always had a - I'm not...

572
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,790
我现在还做不到
ready to do that.

573
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:33,500
帮我个忙  尝一下
You do me a favor and taste this real quick?

574
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,460
我不饿
I'm not hungry.

575
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,910
我不管你饿不饿
I don't care if you're hungry.

576
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,840
我只想确保姑娘们不会嫌太辣
Just want to make sure it's not too hot for the girls.

577
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,130
她们一周都没好好吃
They been eating crap all week.

578
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,580
我想确保她们吃顿好的
I want to make sure they get a good meal.

579
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:47,060
尝尝看辣度怎么样就行
Just check the damn spice level on that, if you could.

580
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,040
我想确保大家都会吃
I want to make sure everyone's gonna eat it.

581
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,720
挺好的
It's good.

582
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,560
不太辣吗
Not too spicy?

583
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,680
不
No.

584
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,310
真的很棒
It's really good.

585
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,430
那就好
Good.

586
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,630
饭待会儿就好
The food will be ready in a minute

587
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,910
把大家叫齐吧
if you want to gather the troops.

588
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,130
好的
Yeah, sure.

589
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,650
你知道卡梅伦去哪了吗
Uh, do you know where Cameron is?

590
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,240
不知道
No.

591
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,060
我就...
Hey, I just...

592
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,440
需要点时间
needed a -- a minute.

593
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,510
嗯
Yeah.

594
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,490
博斯带了食物来  我们待会儿要吃饭了
Bos brought some food, so we're gonna eat soon,

595
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,860
要一起来吗
if you want to join.

596
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,780
天呐
Oh, God.

597
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,770
这太难承受了
This is too much.

598
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,830
我不知道...
I didn't know...

599
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,050
来这儿会这么难
it would be this hard to be here.

600
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,220
没事的  我不...
It's okay. I didn't, um...

601
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,050
我不是想弄得以我为中心的
I don't mean to make this about me.

602
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,070
没事  以你为中心吧
Please, make it about you.

603
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,420
我觉得大家都在哄我
I feel like everybody's been handling me.

604
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,950
没人知道该怎么做
Nobody knows how to act.

605
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:50,580
我很喜欢大家说"你还好吗"
Well, I really love it when people say, "How are you doing?"

606
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,710
我确定我就问过你这个
I'm pretty sure I asked you that.

607
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,970
当然了
Yeah, of course you did.

608
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:58,390
不然你还能说什么
'Cause what else are you gonna say?

609
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:01,370
然后  要怎么回答呢
And then, yeah, how do you answer?

610
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,660
撑着呢
Hangin' in there.

611
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,830
没错
That's right.

612
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:07,930
因为诚实回答的话
'Cause to answer honestly,

613
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:11,000
你就得喋喋不休地说好几天
you'd have to talk incessantly for days,

614
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,080
谁想听呢  是吧
and who wants to listen to that, right?

615
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,170
那么
So...

616
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:22,710
你还好吗
How are you doing?

617
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,000
撑着呢
Hangin' in there.

618
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:39,000
我失去了一个好...朋友
I lost a really good...friend.

619
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,030
我本来就没有多少好朋友
And I don't have that many of those to spare.

620
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,530
我知道  我真可怜
I know, like...poor me.

621
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,970
但我一直不太会
But I've always had a bit of trouble

622
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:09,180
发展那样的关系
making those sorts of connections.

623
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,320
我生命中没有多少人
There's just not a lot of people in my life.

624
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,180
我也是
Me neither.

625
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,290
我都没法跟乔说话
I can't even talk to Joe.

626
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,490
为什么
Why not?

627
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,680
我们现在  心境不同
We're at...different places in our life.

628
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,220
这让他想起了很多事
This has brought up a lot of stuff for him.

629
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:46,340
比如呢
Like what?

630
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,780
他想要孩子
He wants kids.

631
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,190
我...
I-I'm...

632
00:44:59,030 --> 00:44:59,920
如果你想要  我觉得你会是个好...
If you want that, I think you'd be great --

633
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,080
不  我不想要
No, I...do not.

634
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,920
我从来没想要过
I mean, I just never have.

635
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,320
我也不觉得这点会变
And I don't see that changing.

636
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:17,480
那就别了
Well, then don't.

637
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,660
真的很难的
It's really hard, and I...

638
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,760
你必须真的很想要才能做到差不多好
You have to really want it to do a halfway decent job.

639
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,900
而且
I mean...

640
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:32,240
即便如此
Even then...

641
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,060
你一直想要的
You always wanted it.

642
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,170
这个嘛
I mean, I...

643
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:39,820
我并没打算刚出学校就怀上
I didn't plan on getting pregnant right out of school,

644
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,160
但是  对  我一直想要的
yeah, yeah, I-I always wanted it.

645
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:53,400
没有那种感觉也没什么不对
And there's nothing wrong with not feeling that way.

646
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,440
谢谢
Thank you.

647
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,600
但如果你改主意了
If you change your mind, though,

648
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,690
我有个17岁的娃  我正想打发走
I've got a 17-year-old I'm looking to unload, so...

649
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,670
好吧
Whatever.

650
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:33,750
我想他
I -- I miss him.

651
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:40,210
我也是
So do I.

652
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,460
我也想你
And I miss you, too.

653
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:01,360
我在呢
I'm here.

654
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:16,630
我花了...
I spent so much...

655
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:21,450
我花了那么多时间跟他说
I spent so much time telling him...

656
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,970
他都做错了什么
everything he did wrong...

657
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,790
他是做错了很多事
He did a ton wrong.

658
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:02,960
好香啊
Something smells good.

659
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:04,910
当然  这是祖传菜谱
Sure. It's an old family recipe.

660
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,180
如果谁想要酸豆配辣椒酱
Oh, well, if anybody wants capers in their chili,

661
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,590
冰箱里有14罐呢
there's about 14 jars of it in the fridge.

662
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,900
你好大胆
How dare you.

663
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,390
我父亲会从坟里跳出来的
My father'd leap out of his grave.

664
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:16,600
谢谢
Thank you.

665
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,440
那天看到一份菜谱  往辣椒酱里加菠萝
Saw a recipe the other day called for pineapple in chili.

666
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,650
什么啊
What?

667
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,620
能相信吗  菠萝
Can you believe that? Pineapple? In the --

668
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,840
这国家是怎么了
What the hell is this country coming to?

669
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,210
-不了  谢谢  -那
- Oh, no, thank you. - So, um...

670
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:38,060
接下来怎么办  谁来取这些东西
what, uh, happens next? Who comes for all this stuff?

671
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,810
有家公司会负责
Uh, there's a company that takes care

672
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:43,290
家具和物品的拍卖
of the sale of the furniture and things.

673
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:49,160
什么那么好笑
What's so funny?

674
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,260
私人笑话  你不会懂的
It's an inside joke. You wouldn't get it.

675
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,140
海莉
Haley?

676
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,630
抱歉我没拿回你爸的毛衣
I'm sorry I couldn't get your dad's sweater back.

677
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,380
没事的
That's okay.

678
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,460
你记得爸爸曾想让我们相信
Do you remember when Dad tried to convince us

679
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:19,530
他赢过一个卡拉马祖的吃热狗大赛吗
that he won a hot-dog eating contest in Kalamazoo?

680
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:20,600
那不是真的吗
That wasn't true?

681
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,070
亲爱的  不是哦
Oh, honey, no.

682
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:23,790
他干吗要编那样的谎话
Why would he make that up?

683
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:24,950
我不知道
I don't know.

684
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:27,660
他大概觉得挺逗的吧
I -- I think he thought it was funny.

685
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:30,170
-逗死了  -爸爸好怪
- That's hilarious. - Dad was such a weirdo.

686
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:35,890
乔  能把盐递给我吗
Hey, Joe, can you pass the salt?

687
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:37,670
好
Yeah.

688
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,800
你房间怎么样了  亲爱的
How's your room looking, sweetheart?

689
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,130
乱成一团
Uh, it's a mess.

690
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:11,940
天啊  不  妈妈  老天爷啊
Oh, God, no, Mom, for God's sake,

691
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,520
别飞回来
do not fly back here for this.

692
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,100
他很快就会回来的
It's... He'll be back soon.

693
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,760
不  妈妈...
No, Mo--

694
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,520
天啊  我就不该告诉你
God, I should never have told you.

695
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,940
不是大事的
It's not a big deal.

696
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:23,850
我觉得他就是压力太大  好吗
I think he's just under a lot of stress, okay?

697
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:24,990
就是...
It's...

698
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,530
他很快会回来的
He'll be back soon.

699
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,770
我知道  他很快就会回来的
Oh, I know, I know. He'll be back soon.

700
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:32,250
他会的  我知道
He will. I know.

701
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:40,900
*我的好宝贝  擦干眼泪*
*Baby mine, dry your eyes*

702
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:45,610
*把头枕在我心上*
*Rest your head close to my heart*

703
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:47,490
*永不分离*
*Never to part*

704
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:49,660
*我的好宝贝*
*Baby of mine*

705
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:27,840
再不许那么对我了
Don't you ever do that to me again, okay?

706
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,540
我不会了
I won't.

好吧  这是一个广告
Okay -- it's, uh, a commercial.

69
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,690
广告是为了卖出产品
And commercials exist to sell products.

70
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,600
但这不仅是件产品  不是的
But this isn't just a product. It isn't.

71
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,510
这是一种新的联接方式

这是新版彗星  将于今晚发布
So, this is the new Comet, and it launches tonight.

75
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,610
我们不再是人们
No longer are we just a way station

76
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,820
探索路上的中转站了
on people's journey someplace else.

77
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,130
我们就是目的地
We are the destination.

78
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,600
这多亏了在座每一位的努力

It's Cameron's last day

83
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,340
今天也是卡梅伦在这里的最后一天了
now that work on the relaunch is complete...

84
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,320
别这样  我们都知道她总有一天要离开我们
Settle down. We all knew her days were numbered.

85
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,200
我还想提一个人
So, one more person I'd like to mention.

86
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,640
这个地方的一个重要灵魂人物已经不在了
A huge part of the soul of this place is no longer here.

87
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,360
但这是一项家族事业
But this is a family business.

88
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,200
彗星始于海莉·克拉克
Comet began with Haley Clark.

89
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,010
她爸爸和我在1983年结识
Her dad and I met back in 1983.

90
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,560
我告诉他  "电脑不是终点
And I told him, "Computers aren't the thing.

91
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,580
只是我们达到终点的工具"
They're the thing that gets us to the thing."

92
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,520
这就是...
And this is the...

00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,190
继续吧
Back to it!

101
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,770
-我们可以讨论一下...  -我们有些模型
- Think we can, uh, discuss that -- - We have some mock-ups.

102
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,040
好的  五分钟
Yeah, five minutes.

103
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,100
你没事吧
You okay?

104
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,980

Just...get some dinner

107
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,890
找个地方停车亲热之类的
and make out in a parked car somewhere?

108
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,040
脱掉衣服  来点点心
A little over-the-clothes stuff and some dim sum.

109
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,020
那我去和大家告别
So I guess I will say goodbye to the guys,

110
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,890
然后打给阿莱克莎了
and, uh, I can call Alexa.

111
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,980
当然了  好的
Of course. Yeah.

112
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,120
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,640
请乘坐国泰航空590航班
at this time, we are now boarding

114
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,870
直达曼谷的乘客
our main-cabin passengers onto Pacific Flight 590,

115
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,790
开始登机
with nonstop service to Bangkok.

116
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,320
我差点忘了  等等
I almost forgot. Hang on.

117
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,480
-这是什么  -这是个旅行记事簿
- What is this? - That is a travel organizer.

118
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,520
我在里面放了一张小型曼谷地图
I put a little map of Bangkok in there.

119
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,140
还能在里面放一些零钱
Compartments for loose change

120
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,810
你的护照和旅行支票
and, um, your passport, traveler's checks.

121
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,230
妈妈  我不要这个
Mom, I'm not taking this.

122
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,220
为什么
Why?

123
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,720
因为我是18岁  不是45岁
Because I'm 18 and not 45.

124
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,600
我要住招待所
I'm staying in hostels.

125
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,800
如果你想让我被抢
If you actually want me to get mugged,

126
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,910
我拿着LV钱包到处逛就行了
I'll walk around with a Louis Vuitton wallet.

127
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,140
妈妈  这是我的旅行
Mom, this is my trip.

128
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,280
我希望你能将我当做一个成年人
I just wish you'd treat me like an adult.

129
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,330
而且我的确是
Which I am, by the way.

130
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,410
你...
You...

131
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:56,920
好吧
Fine.

132
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,650
注意安全
Be safe.

133
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,650
好
Okay.

134
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,050
-再见  -天啊
- Bye. - Oh, my God.

135
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,830
我的车钥匙在我桌子上
Keys to my Civic are on my desk.

136
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,760
拿我的旧驾照吧
Take my old driver's license, okay?

137
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,420
以防万一
Just in case.

138
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,720
照片是以前拍的  不过
It's an old photo, but...

139
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,950
警察不会怀疑你的  你这么可爱
the cops will believe you 'cause you're a cute girl.

140
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,430
不过保险起见还是戴顶帽子吧
Maybe wear a hat just in case.

141
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,140
好
Yeah.

142
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,220
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

143
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,860
这是直飞曼谷的
this is the final boarding call

144
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,900
国泰航空590航班
for the Cathay Pacific Flight 590...

145
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,160
-好吧  -最后一次登机呼叫
- Okay. - ...with nonstop service to Bangkok.

146
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,710
别走
Don't go.

147
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,870
你不用走的
You don't have to go.

148
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,320
我不知道你为什么非得现在走
I don't know why you have to do this right now.

149
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,480
你该  留下来
You should just... just stay.

150
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,450
你别说胡话了  妈
This is such bullshit, Mom.

151
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,300
我们走吧  妈
Let's go, Mom.

152
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,160
医生抱怨他老婆
The doctor complains to his wife

153
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,940
最近夫妻生活不和谐了
that she ain't so good in bed anymore.

154
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,430
他去上班
Well, he goes to work.

155
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,040
到了中午他打电话给她
And by midday, he calls her on the phone.

156
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,990
然后电话响啊响
And the phone rings and it rings...

157
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,620
就是没人接
And it rings and it rings.

158
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,420
然后她终于接了  气喘吁吁的
And, uh, finally, she picks up. She's out of breath.

159
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,840
然后他问  "你怎么这么半天不接电话"
And he goes, "What the hell took you so long to answer the phone?"

160
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,620
然后她说
And she says...

161
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,900
说想再找个人[医生]看看  是吧
Something about a second opinion, right?

162
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,260
是啊  就是这样
Yeah. That's the one.

163
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,690
支架看起来还行
So...stent looks pretty good.

164
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,450
嗯
Yeah.

165
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,120
有没有呼吸困难  胸痛之类的
Any shortness of breath, chest pains?

166
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,480
没有
No. No.

167
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,750
就是有时候解大便太使劲会头晕
Get a little light-headed sometimes if I shit real big.

168
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,370
我还没问过你  莱韦克
You know, I never asked you -- Levecq --

169
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,960
这是哪里的名字
what the hell kinda name is that?

170
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,410
莱韦克  是瑞典名字吗
Levecq? Is it, uh...Swedish?

171
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,380
还是挪威的  还是
Or...is it Norwegian, or...

172
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,810
还是捷克  捷克斯洛伐克那块的
Is it a Czech-- Czechoslovakian?

173
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,870
还是法属加拿大
Little French Canadian there?

174
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,040
荷兰
Dutch.

175
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,410
你没问题了
You're good to go.

176
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,750
好吧  可是
Okay, but -- wh--

177
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,660
我什么时候再回来
When do you want me to come back?

178
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,580
不用回来
I don't.

179
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,230
不用观察复诊什么的吗
Well, not even for a look-see?

180
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,250
你不用确定我情绪稳定什么的吗
I mean...don't you want to make sure I'm not blowing a gasket?

181
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,400
不用
Nope.

182
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,930
觉得不舒服  就打电话
Something goes wrong, call.

183
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,190
没不舒服的话  就不用
If doesn't, don't.

184
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,780
你很健康  约翰
You're in good health, John.

185
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,520
如果你好好保养
If you take care of yourself,

186
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,380
没准能活到21世纪呢
you'll live well into the 21st century.

187
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,240
21世纪
21st century.

188
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,650
真特么...
Son of a...

189
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,910
马克·安德雷森和吉姆·克拉克
So then Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark

190
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,560
飞到厄巴纳-香槟
fly out to Urbana Champaign,

191
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,890
把所有马赛克程序员叫来开餐会
gather all the Mosaic coders in a pizza joint,

192
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,550
给他们六万五的年薪
and offer them $65,000 salaries,

193
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,520
乘他的游艇去大溪地度一周的假
a-a week's vacation on his yacht in Tahiti,

194
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,550
以及公司的十万股股份
and 100,000 shares of the company.

195
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,470
克拉克还告诉他们如果他们离开超算中心
And Clark tells them that if they leave NCSA

196
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,330
转而为他工作
and come work for him,

197
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,500
他们的公司五年之内就会市值破千万
they'll be worth $10 million in less than five years.

198
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,280
所以吉姆·克拉克把一家烂公司的
So Jim Clark steals all the best coders

199
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,590
最好的程序员都偷来去做更好的事
from a shitty company to go do something way better...

200
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,160
怎么听着这么耳熟呢
Why does that sound familiar?

201
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,340
总之我是想说他们都跟他走了
Anyway, my point is that they've all followed him

202
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,550
来到了硅谷  做出了一款浏览器
out to Silicon Valley to build a browser,

203
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,650
而现在网景就要碾压马赛克了
and now Netscape is about to demolish Mosaic.

204
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,600
如果我们要想在网景内置彗星
If we were to launch Comet inside Netscape,

205
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,710
就算能正常载入  也会慢得要死
it'd be slow as hell, if it even loads correctly.

206
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,960
如果不成的话  那流浪者和其他对手也不行
And if it doesn't, then Rover won't or any of our competitors.

207
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,410
但如果我们能想出办法
But if we can figure out a way

208
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,700
让彗星在网景上运行流畅
to make Comet run smoothly on Netscape,

209
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,080
那所有的用户都会流向我们
then all of their users will flock to us.

210
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,760
但那些创造了马赛克的人
But those guys created Mosaic.

211
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,520
他们已经知道怎么制作能正常运行的浏览器
They already know how to make a browser that runs.

212
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,180
但他们不能复制他们自己的成果
But they can't replicate what they've already done.

213
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,010
马赛克已经注册知识产权了
The Mosaic code is intellectual property.

214
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:25,560
就像BIOS一样
Like the BIOS.

215
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,690
是啊  就像BIOS
Yeah, like the BIOS.

216
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,120
而只有投放市场后  他们才能知道效果如何
And they won't know how it works until it's out in the wild.

217
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,390
而且他们
And -- And...they...

218
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,480
他们会希望使网景比马赛克更强
They'll want to make Netscape better than Mosaic.

219
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,960
乔  你到底想说什么
Joe...what are we doing here?

220
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,420
你完全可以在床上告诉我
You could've told me all of this in bed.

221
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,670
声卡坏了
The sound card's blown.

222
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,910
除了这个  其他都很好
Other than that, it runs perfectly.

223
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,170
好吧
'Kay.

224
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,960
我还需要请你帮个忙
I need one more thing from you.

225
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,700
是个小忙  等网景发售之后
It's a quick job. When Netscape launches,

226
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,640
我们得拆分其代码  让彗星能更快地载入
we pull apart the code so that Comet can load fast.

227
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,100
所以你就拿《飞天蜈蚣》贿赂我
And you're bribing me with Centipede?

228
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,020
如果我们能做成  那我们就有了一件展示品
If we can pull this off, we'll have a -- a showpiece

229
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,840
能让吉姆·克拉克用来强化他的作品
to offer Jim Clark so he can promote his baby.

230
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,900
他们会求我们成为他们架构的一部分
They will beg for us to be a part of their infrastructure.

231
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,580
好吧
Okay.

232
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,380
我们不能等网景上市  那样就太晚了
We can't wait until Netscape launches. It's too late.

233
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,980
我们得优化彗星
We have to optimize Comet

234
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,790
让它第一天就能高速运行
so that it's running fast on Day One.

235
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,250
如果你想给吉姆·克拉克展示
Which, if you want a showcase for Jim Clark...

236
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,340
今天我们就得开始拆分网景的代码
we need to start pulling apart the Netscape code today.

237
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,210
但他们不可能给我们一份调试版拷贝
But there's no way they're going to just give us a working copy.

238
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,930
没错
Oh, no, they won't.

239
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,430
我去打个电话
Let me make a call.

240
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,230
我爱你
I love you.

241
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,150
什么声音
What is that sound?

242
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,650
是戈登的腕表
It's Gordon's wristwatch.

243
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,220
他需要吃药时就会响
It would go off when he needed to take his medication.

244
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,910
我不知道办公室钥匙在哪
I don't know where the key to the office is.

245
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:21,840
好吧
Okay.

246
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,460
我今天去找个锁匠
I'll call a locksmith today.

247
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,350
你想玩玩吗
Do you want to play?

248
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,500
好啊
Sure.

249
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:44,920
好
All right.

250
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,170
西雅图如何
How, uh -- How was Seattle?

251
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,470
湿漉漉的
Soggy.

252
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,710
抱歉这样突然出现
Sorry about the ambush.

253
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,590
我看到你的车停在车道上
I saw your car parked in the driveway,

254
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,540
但没有人应门铃
and nobody answered when I rang the bell.

255
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,690
你感觉如何  送琼妮走
How was it? Sending Joanie off?

256
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,220
还好
You know, fine.

257
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,750
只希望她注意安全
Just hope she stays safe.

258
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,780
詹妮弗在斯坦福安顿下来了吗
How's Jennifer settling in at Stanford?

259
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,320
她第一个周末回家了一趟
Well, she was home the first weekend.

260
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,630
洗衣服  偷食吃
Doing laundry, stealing food.

261
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,970
-嗯  -去年这时
- Yeah. - Last year at this time,

262
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,630
我想都不忍去想她离家上大学
I couldn't bear the thought of her leaving for college.

263
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,830
而现在  我倒希望她能再走远点
And now...I kinda wish she'd at least left the zip code.

264
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,420
好吧
Yeah, well...

265
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,540
我们有个好消息
So...we have news.

266
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,620
金柏莉怀孕了
Kimberly is pregnant.

267
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,410
什么  恭喜
Wh-- I-- Congratulations!

268
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,460
太棒了
That's amazing.

269
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,270
对  也不是  但谢谢了
Yeah. No, but thanks.

270
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,960
但趁她还能坐飞机  我们全家想去
But the whole family wants to take a big trip to Ireland

271
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,500
爱尔兰玩一趟
while she can still fly.

272
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,590
约翰和我想自己出去玩玩
And John and I would like to do some traveling of our own --

273
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,480
我明白  你准备迈向新生活了
No, I know. You're ready to move on.

274
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,150
唐娜  我理解  你这段时间不容易
Donna, I understand. It's been hard.

275
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,470
但已经过去四个月了
But it's been four months.

276
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,070
我需要知道你在做什么
And I need to know what you're doing.

277
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,990
我在游泳
I'm swimming.

278
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,630
一切都已经搞定了
We have greased the rails.

279
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,920
执行合伙人是你的了
Managing partner is yours.

280
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,090
没跑了
Period.

281
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,290
你说想和女儿一起过夏天
You said you wanted the summer to be with your girls.

282
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,880
我理解  但是夏天已经过完了  唐娜
I heard that. But the summer is over, Donna.

283
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,580
你等得越久  就越难
The longer you wait, the harder it's gonna get.

284
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,740
崔普和他的手下每天在办公室耀武扬威
Trip and his stooges are strutting through that office every day

285
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,510
觉着自己能比你做得好
thinking they can run it better than you.

286
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,370
他们觉得你怂了
They think you're getting soft.

287
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,690
如果你不想干  没关系
Look, if you don't want this, it's okay.

288
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,100
我们可以谈那个
We can have that conversation.

289
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,690
但你要做个决定
But you need to make a decision.

290
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,370
好吧
Okay, well...

291
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,220
好好想想
give it some thought,

292
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,670
决定了告诉我
and let me know.

293
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,340
你一定是在逗我
You got to be kiddin' me.

294
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,540
不会吧
Whaaat?

295
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,980
你回来得比我想的晚
You're home later than I thought.

296
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,970
旅途如何
How was the trip?

297
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,030
挺好的
It was good.

298
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,110
抱歉  我下飞机回家的路上顺道去看了下唐娜
Sorry, I stopped to see Donna on the way home from the airport.

299
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,250
所以结论如何
Well, so what's the verdict?

300
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,530
我们要展翅高飞去看世界
We gonna sprout wings and see the world

301
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,850
还是她准备在那个游泳池里漂一辈子
or is she gonna float in that swimming pool forever?

302
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,040
我不知道
You know, I don't know.

303
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,150
我去洗下风尘
I'm gonna go wash the plane off me.

304
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,220
好  这些是什么东西
All right. Hey, what is all this stuff?

305
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,880
可能是本的一些旧玩意
Some of Ben's old junk, I suppose.

306
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,740
你一个人的时候都做了些什么
What have you been doing with your bachelorhood?

307
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,380
到处晃
Well, you know, fartin' around.

308
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,810
搞点这个搞点那个  看医生
This and that. Went to the doctor.

309
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,750
他宣布我健康了
Got a clean bill of health.

310
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,320
他说我能健康活到21世纪
He said I should live well into the 21st century.

311
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,290
你能想象吗  
You imagine that?

312
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,030
人人都背着飞行器  机器人主宰世界
Jet packs and robot overlords.

313
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,290
看看我还发现了什么
Look what I found, too.

314
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,910
你敢相信吗  这是卡迪夫原版的
Can you believe this? This is a Cardiff original.

315
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,990
我年轻时还亲手把这玩意
I could've packed this thing in a box myself

316
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,010
打包装箱呢  天呐
when I was a teenager. My God.

317
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,450
我敢说还好使呢
I bet it still works.

318
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,560
只需要换块电池
I just need to get some batteries for it.

319
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:48,980
怎么了
What?

320
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,470
亲爱的  怎么了
Honey, what?

321
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,330
-怎么了  -抱歉  我
- What? - I'm sorry, I...

322
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,990
你会没事了
You're gonna be okay.

323
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,070
是啊  我没事
Yeah, I'm okay

324
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,410
我没事
I'm okay.

325
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,420
我会好好的
I'm gonna be okay.

326
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,370
老天
Mercy.

327
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,760
你真是没夸大你身上的风尘味儿啊
You weren't kidding about that plane goo, were ya?

328
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,550
去吧  好好搓搓洗洗
Come on! Get to scrubbing!

329
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,830
瞧瞧
Look at ya.

330
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,240
我们要怎么为网景优化
But how do we optimize for Netscape

331
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,420
它还不存在呢
if there's no Netscape yet?

332
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,960
我明白  我也在想办法
Look, I get it. And I'm trying to figure it out.

333
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,160
但与此同时  我们还得
But in the meantime, we still have to go through --

334
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,480
好的  稍等
Okay. One second.

335
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,390
给你的
For you.

336
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,820
天  谢谢
Oh, God. Thank you.

337
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,570
不客气
Sure.

338
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,900
来  我带你转转
Here, let me show you out.

339
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,300
这就是彗星
So this is Comet.

340
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,670
是的
Yeah.

341
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,400
我今天看到水星了
I -- I saw the Mercury today.

342
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,270
你做的机器人技术的那个看起来太酷了
God, the robotics thing you're doing looks so cool.

343
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,530
我和他们几周后要飞去参加大会
I'm flying out with those guys in a few weeks --

344
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,680
在巴黎大学  你也该一起来
conference at the Sorbonne. You should come.

345
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:10,920
这
That's --

346
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,860
我觉得这东西非常有意思
I mean, I find all that stuff super fascinating,

347
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,400
但不是我擅长的
but...it's not really my thing.

348
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,970
-是吧  -不  我懂
- Right? - No, I know.

349
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,040
但就去几天  费用全包
But it's just a couple of days. All expenses paid.

350
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,750
最坏的情况也就是
Worst that happens?

351
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,610
遇见一些很棒的人
You meet some fascinating people

352
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,400
吃了太多热月龙虾
and eat too much lobster thermidor.

353
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,180
是啊
Yeah.

354
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,680
下次吧
Next time.

355
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,490
上次你就这么说
Is what you said last time.

356
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,730
我明白
Look, I know that --

357
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,120
我说了你很多好话  大家都很感兴趣
I've been talking you up. People are really interested.

358
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,480
那很棒
And that's...great.

359
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,930
听着  我知道这段时间很艰难
Hey, look, I'm sure that it's been a tough time

360
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,010
对你们都是
for all of you.

361
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,930
我也明白你想帮朋友一把
And I get that you're trying to help a friend out.

362
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,090
当然  我还年轻  所以懂得不多
And I'm young, so, you know, what do I know.

363
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,790
但是你被责任所累
But you can get so tied up in your obligations

364
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,860
而忘了你最大的责任是对自己的未来
you forget your biggest obligation is to your future self.

365
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,620
我明白
I know that.

366
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,030
好吧
Okay.

367
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,320
谢谢
Thank you.

368
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,440
还有
And...

369
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,150
说真的  这是最后一次了
Seriously, this is the last thing.

370
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:07,970
但愿如此
I hope so.

371
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,570
但这些是老大的虾
But these are, like, huge shrimps,

372
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,040
就不该叫虾了
like, should not be called shrimp,

373
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,540
上面还有那种小小的触须一样的东西
and had those, like, little feeler touchy things still attached?

374
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:35,960
不会吧
No!

375
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:36,870
-真的  -不
- Yes! - No.

376
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,070
超大盘  油炸的
Huge plate, deep-fried,

377
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,310
那些像触须一样的东西有这么长
and those...feeler things were, like, this long.

378
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,220
-拜托  -不
- Come on. - Oh, no.

379
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,370
快告诉我你没吃
Please tell me you didn't eat one.

380
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,050
那是商务晚宴  我必须得吃
It was a business dinner. I had to.

381
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,590
所以我喝了一大口清酒  拿起了一个  然后
So I took a glug of saké, picked one up, and just...

382
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,050
我的天哪
Oh, good lord.

383
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,060
你真是太恶心了
You're disgusting.

384
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,400
这就是我的经历
That's my story.

385
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,680
好了  乔  该你了
Okay, Joe, you're up.

386
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,100
好  鼠海豚睾丸
Yeah. Uhh... Porpoise testicles.

387
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,290
乔...
Joe...

388
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,830
你不可能吃了鼠海豚睾丸
you did not eat porpoise testicles.

389
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,700
我百分之百吃了
I 100% did.

390
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,270
吃鼠海豚的任何部位都是非法的
It is not legal to even eat any porpoise anything.

391
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,680
我吃了那些鱼卵蛋
I ate those fishy balls.

392
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,630
真的吃了
I did.

393
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,380
鼠海豚有睾丸吗
Do porpoises even have testicles?

394
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,640
应该有吧  其实鼠海豚到底是什么
I think so. I mean, what is porpoise?

395
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,780
我觉得那应该是鼠海豚
I mean, yeah. I think it was a porpoise.

396
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,780
管它是什么  那东西很湿软
But whatever it was, it was -- it was squishy,

397
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,580
然后我吐了
and I vomited...

398
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,620
吐到了阴沟里  唐娜  到你了
into the gutter, and... Donna, you're up.

399
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,440
好  生牛肉片
Yeah. All right -- beef carpaccio.

400
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,010
味道超奇怪
So weird.

401
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,680
卡梅伦以前会
Cameron will do this thing

402
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,590
-弄一个...  -什么
- where she can, uh, like, set up, uh... - What?

403
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,050
香肠  蛋黄酱  泡菜的装配流水线
an assembly line of bologna, mayonnaise and pickles.

404
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,760
不  不是泡菜  是酸黄瓜
No, not pickles -- cornichon.

405
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,960
-是  没错  -我说错了
- And, yes, duh... - I'm corrected.

406
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,110
非常美味  你弄一碟蛋黄酱
it's delicious. You get a pile of mayonnaise,

407
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,430
一碟酸黄瓜
pile of cornichon,

408
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,690
把酸黄瓜在蛋黄酱里蘸一下
dip the cornichon in the mayonnaise,

409
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,920
塞到香肠里  扔进嘴里
wrap it in bologna, pop it in your mouth.

410
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,510
听起来好恶心
That's pretty gross.

411
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,040
你们有琼妮的消息吗
So have you guys heard from Joanie?

412
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,290
有
Yeah.

413
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,330
她去了大皇宫
Uh, she went to the Grand Palace,

414
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,610
那儿有一个很大的大象园
and she saw this huge elephant park

415
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,140
还有一个叫真理寺的建筑
and something called the Sanctuary of Truth,

416
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,030
是一座大型的全木质结构寺庙
which is this massive temple carved totally out of wood.

417
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,680
第二晚  她遇到了季风
And on her second night, there was this monsoon?

418
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,170
但和这儿的不一样  那里的雨很暖和
But it's not like here, the rain was super warm,

419
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,720
所以她就去大街上跑  全身都湿透了
so she went running through the streets and she got all soaked

420
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,710
最后去一个小摊吃了碗面
and she ended up eating noodles in this little shack

421
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,970
和一些陌生人交了朋友
and made friends with these total strangers,

422
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,350
他们现在要徒步旅行去普吉岛了
and now they're all backpacking to Phuket.

423
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,760
好棒啊
That's awesome.

424
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,260
我知道  就好像...
Yeah, I know. It's like...

425
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,110
她决定要做什么
She decides she want to do something,

426
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,420
就去做了  你知道吗
and she just does it, you know?

427
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,130
那她接下来要去哪里
Where's she going next?

428
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,710
我不知道
I don't know.

429
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,160
我也不知道
I don't know.

430
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,090
她打来时我没跟她说上话
I, uh, didn't get a chance to talk to her when she called.

431
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,440
她只跟海莉聊了
She just spoke to Haley, so...

432
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,330
海莉  我想给你看样东西
Hey, Haley. There's something I want to show you.

433
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,440
跟我来
Come with me.

434
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,660
嗯  去看看吧
Yeah, go check it out.

435
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,200
-好  -我们收拾
- Okay. - We'll clean up.

436
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,240
是广告
It's the commercial.

437
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,910
我一直想给你看来着
I've just been dying to show it to you.

438
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,280
不  算了吧
Oh...no, that's -- that's okay.

439
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,520
不  你一定得看  来吧
No, you got to see this. Come on.

440
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,330
我们哪天该去吃顿午饭
We got to grab lunch soon.

441
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,530
聊聊最近的事
Catch up, you know?

442
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,960
好啊
Yeah, sure.

443
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,800
抱歉  我们并不是真要洗盘子
Sorry. We're not actually gonna do the dishes.

444
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,260
乔洗盘子有很特定的方式
Um, Joe likes the dishes done in a very paicular way,

445
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,770
而我不会那么洗
and I'm not good at doing them like that,

446
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,140
所以我就干脆不洗了
so I just don't do them anymore.

447
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,470
你现在是新黛安了
Hey, so you're the new Diane now.

448
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,340
不是的  还没正式定下来呢
Oh...Yeah, no. I mean, nothing's official yet.

449
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,160
我还在考虑我究竟想不想要
I'm still trying to decide if I even want it.

450
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,100
什么  你当然想要了
What? Of course you want it.

451
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,210
是啊  只是
Yeah, you know, it's just,

452
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,160
我已经不怎么管创意方面的工作了
I'm already so far removed from the creative side of things.

453
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,570
做了执行合伙人就更糟了  懂吧
And it only gets worse if you're managing partner, you know?

454
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,060
跟阿莱克莎怎么样了
How are things with Alexa?

455
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,440
你在做什么新东西吗
Are you, uh, you working on something new?

456
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,760
算是吧
Kinda. Yeah.

457
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,330
天呐  她刚拿到个...
God, she just scored with this --

458
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,390
是啊  机器人那个
Oh, yeah, the robotics thing.

459
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,810
机器人  是的  水星
Robotics, yeah, yeah, yeah. The Mercury...

460
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,500
嗯  天啊  我真怀念那个
Yeah. Ugh. God, I miss that.

461
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,390
做事情
Doing things.

462
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,190
嗯
Yeah.

463
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,380
她其实也不做什么
I mean, it's not like she actually did anything.

464
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,130
她就是负责找人
She just found those people, you know?

465
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,110
她并不亲手去做的
She doesn't really get her hands dirty.

466
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,650
怎么  你想做点什么吗
Why, do you want to do something?

467
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,970
不是
No.

468
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,050
我也不知道
I don't know.

469
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,050
我就是...
I just --

470
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:45,010
我好久没自己想出过什么点子了
I haven't had an original idea in kind of a long time.

471
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,480
你想到了社区
Well, you came up with Community.

472
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,820
那就是个
That was just an idea

473
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,350
依附于你的点子的点子
that percolated down from one of your ideas.

474
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,730
并不是那样的
That's not totally accurate.

475
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:02,760
而且  点子也不是工作本身
And, anyway, ideas are, like, not the work.

476
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,840
是啊
Yeah.

477
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,840
你的工作
I mean, what you do --

478
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,400
并不仅仅是签支票
it's more than just signing a check.

479
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,910
我现在明白了
I-I get that now.

480
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:18,370
那我不是寄生虫咯
So I'm not parasite?

481
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,350
你不是寄生虫
You're not a parasite.

482
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,480
什么啊
What the hell.

483
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,260
等等  海莉  等等
Hey, hold on. Haley, wait.

484
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,090
是因为
Is it because...

485
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,260
见到他很怪吗
It's weird to see him.

486
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,270
怪吗
Is it weird?

487
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:44,040
是啊  看到我死去的爸爸
Yeah, it's weird to see my dead dad

488
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,750
出现在一则破广告里很怪
in a stupid commercial.

489
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,570
我出现在里面也很怪  而且你都没问过我
It's weird that I'm in it, and that you didn't even ask me,

490
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,310
我现在都不是那副样子了
and I don't even look like that anymore.

491
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,310
还有怪的是  你把我创造的东西
And it's weird that you've taken this thing that I made,

492
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,120
现在它变成你的了
and -- and now it's yours.

493
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,550
而你只想拿它赚钱
And all you want is to make money off of it!

494
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,520
我明白...
Hey, I understa--

495
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,760
我15了  我不想吃饭
I'm 15! I don't want to have lunch

496
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,430
聊聊近况  什么的
and catch up or whatever.

497
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,380
我不想来参加晚宴
I don't want to be at dinners.

498
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,540
我希望大家都别来烦我
I want everyone to leave me alone.

499
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,410
我去车里了
I'll be in the car.

500
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,670
我会把广告撤下
I'm pulling the ad.

501
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,080
乔
Joe...

502
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:36,070
你为广告投了很多钱的
Look, you put a lot of money in that commercial.

503
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,460
别就那么打水漂了
Don't just throw it down the drain.

504
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,550
或许你可以把她的部分剪掉
Maybe you can cut her out of it.

505
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,930
这是我的公司
It's my company.

506
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,940
我睡觉前要去干会儿活儿
I'm gonna do some work. Before bed.

507
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,240
什么活儿
What work?

508
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,520
我一直在拖着阿莱克莎那边的事
I've...been putting things off with Alexa.

509
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,060
我得去想想
And, uh...I need to give that some thought.

510
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:19,250
是我告诉乔可以把你放进广告里的
I gave Joe permission, you know, for you to be in the ad.

511
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,970
如果你生气  也该气我
So if you want to be angry, you should be angry with me.

512
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,620
不怪他的
It's not his fault.

513
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,280
我以为你会喜欢的
I thought you'd like it.

514
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,540
我就是想吃点百吉饼
I just want some Bagel Bites.

515
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,780
海莉  如果你想聊聊
Haley, if there's anything you want to talk about, I'm --

516
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,250
我知道我们说好
Hey, I know we said I'd go back to work

517
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,070
你回学校我就回去工作
as soon as you started back up at school,

518
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,770
但如果你想  我可以留在家
but if you want, I can stay home --

519
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,840
不  我希望你回去工作
No. I want you to go back to work.

520
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,480
我希望你别再那么担心我了
And I want you to stop worrying about me so much.

521
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,030
担心你自己吧
Just, you know, worry about you.

522
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,200
你每天都在家里
You're here all day.

523
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,650
游泳
Swimming.

524
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,460
我喜欢游泳嘛
Well, I like swimming.

525
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,220
嗯  妈妈  我也喜欢游泳  但是拜托
Yeah, Mom, I like swimming, too, but Jesus Christ.

526
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,470
不赖
Not bad.

527
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,880
多好吃
They're incredible.

528
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,790
我回房了
I'm gonna go to my room.

529
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,370
晚安
So good night.

530
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,860
的确很美  是吧
Oh, that is a beaut, huh?

531
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,660
这可可不错
That's good cocoa.

532
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,350
我妈以前会拿真巧克力做
Mama used to make it with real chocolate.

533
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:51,080
把巧克力放进双层锅炉里化掉
She'd put it in the double boiler and melt it down.

534
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,650
他们卖的那什么破烂速溶的
That instant bullshit they have.

535
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,120
那就是碱化可可粉
It's alkalized cocoa powder, what it is.

536
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,580
是烤完了可可豆
That's the garbage that's left over

537
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,190
剩下的垃圾
after they roast the cocoa beans,

538
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,710
他们经过化学处理
and they run it through a chemical bath

539
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,560
让你尝不出是有多难喝
so you can't taste how awful it is.

540
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,490
天呐  简直是暴殄天物
My God, it's a national travesty.

541
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,240
嗯
Yeah, well...

542
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,420
以前一切都真实多了  是吧
things used to be more real, right?

543
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:15,630
能看到它们的原理  如何连接在一起
See the way they worked -- this connects to this.

544
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,550
现在都在芯片上了
Now it's just all on a chip.

545
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,790
是啊  就像魔法
Yeah, it's like magic now.

546
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,010
嗯  我不喜欢那种魔法
Ahh, yeah, well... not my kind of magic.

547
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,350
这个怎么那么特别  非得今天修好
What's so special you need to get this thing fixed today, huh?

548
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,730
你是要错过格伦·米勒舞团了吗
You gonna miss the Glenn Miller Orchestra or something?

549
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:33,850
不  就是心血来潮
No, just got a bug up my butt,

550
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,430
想看看它还能不能用
wanted to see if it still worked.

551
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,060
我以前曾一整天在卡迪夫的工厂里
I used to pack that exact model into boxes all day

552
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,550
把那款机子打包装箱
at the Cardiff factory.

553
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,580
没错
Yeah.

554
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,970
嗯
Yeah.

555
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,040
我还记得那地方的味儿
I can still smell that place.

556
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,610
挺怪的吧
It's weird, isn't it,

557
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,050
你能记住好多早些年的事
how much stuff you remember from early in life?

558
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,260
而中间的部分则...
And how all that stuff in the middle just kinda...

559
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,570
都混在一起了
just kinda runs together.

560
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:01,290
我已经比我父亲过世时大七岁了
I am seven years older than my father was when he died.

561
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,890
在那之前  他一整天
He spent the whole day before

562
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,760
都在大吼着马龙家的大树的根
yelling about how the tree from the Malone place

563
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,530
会长进下水道里
was gonna bore into that sewer line

564
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,750
害他赔一大笔钱
and cost him a damn fortune.

565
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,680
然后  突然  就倒下了
And then boom, down.

566
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,790
他人生最后一天就在抱怨树根
Just...spent his last day bitching about tree roots.

567
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,780
老爸啊
Oh, Dad.

568
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,660
总之  我就是觉得  如果你想要什么
Anyway, it just seems to me if you want something,

569
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,960
最好去搞定它
best to go get it done.

570
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,120
马上
Now.

571
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,780
现在是投手的对决
It's a real pitchers' duel here.

572
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,670
这才叫魔法
Now, that's magic.

573
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,070
是吧
See?

574
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,790
太完美了
Perfect.

575
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,200
你能...
Hey, would you, uh...

576
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,380
你能让黛安给我打个电话吗
Would you have Diane give me a call?

577
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,590
当然
Will do.

578
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,810
不管了
Ahh, screw it.

579
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,520
告诉她我准备好了
Just tell her I'm ready.

580
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,000
好
Okay.

581
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,500
我在想
So, I was thinking.

582
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,010
我有我姐姐的车
I have my sister's car.

583
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,170
记得我说她要去泰国吗
Because remember how I said she's going to Thailand?

584
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,480
她说那里很棒
Which she says is hella badass.

585
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,270
我知道你肯定也有车
And, I mean, I'm sure you have a car, too,

586
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,550
而且我还不能开车呢
and I'm not even supposed to be driving it yet,

587
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,880
但是  不管了
but...whatever.

588
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,130
我在想
So, um, I was -- I was wondering, um,

589
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,670
你听说过《天生杀人狂》吗
have you h-- have you heard of "Natural Born Killers"?

590
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,430
是的
Yes.

591
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,150
嗯  朱丽叶特·刘易斯真是太赞了
Yeah. Juliette Lewis is awesome,

592
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,180
24世纪在上映
and it's playing at the Century 24,

593
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,900
不过电影那么火  可能都售罄了
but it's super popular so it might be sold out...

594
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,170
-那...  -但如果真没票了
- Oh, well, that's -- - But if it is, uh,

595
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,230
我们还可以去温彻斯特神秘屋
then we could go to the Winchester Mystery House

596
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,390
就在旁边
which is right next door,

597
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,890
他们有午夜游
and they do these midnight tours.

598
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,530
特别酷
Which are dope, I think...

599
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,640
嗯
And, um, yeah.

600
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,030
总之
Anyway, um

601
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,840
我能带你去看《天生杀人狂》吗
could I take you to see "Natural Born Killers"?

602
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,120
等等
Okay, hold on.

603
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,290
马上好了
Hold -- almost.

604
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,690
好了
All right.

605
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,710
行了
Okay.

606
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,320
真是太棒了
It's truly a masterpiece.

607
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,430
是啊
Yeah.

608
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,400
这就是你的西斯廷教堂
This is your Sistine Chapel.

609
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:48,330
哎呦  我还在那里找到一盒1982年的肥料
Awww, hell. I found a box of Miracle-Gro down there from 1982.

610
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:51,620
好了
All right.

611
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,810
我不再折腾了
I'm done.

612
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,130
真的
Done, I say.

613
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:01,070
咱俩来好好生活吧
How about you and I do some actual living?

614
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,260
不能取巧吗
Can't we cheat it?

615
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,780
把彗星重复出现的图像存入
Make it so we that we store recurrent Comet images

616
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,280
用户的网景浏览器缓存中
in the user's Netscape cache?

617
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,630
那样加载就快多了
It would make it load so much faster.

618
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:48,150
是啊  如果网景支持这功能的话
Yeah, I would, if Netscape supported that,

619
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,520
但并不  所以
but they don't, so...

620
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,280
询问框修好了吗
Is the query box fixed?

621
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,210
还是如果回车前
Or does it still get a null response

622
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,870
多打了空格依然是无响应
if you put a space before the carriage return?

623
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,370
我还在修
Still on my punch list.

624
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,060
乔  这仍是早期测试版本
Joe, this is still an early beta.

625
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,170
有一堆漏洞
So there's tons of bugs.

626
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,320
我们也不知道他们要修什么
We don't know what they're gonna fix,

627
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,120
怎么修  补丁会如何影响我们
how they're gonna fix it, how those fixes are gonna affect us.

628
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,130
那我还是闭嘴吧
Guess I should just shut up.

629
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,890
不是  你能不能放松
No, but could you just relax?

630
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:12,700
我们有的是时间呢
We've got tons of time.

631
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,740
我们只有两天了
We've got two days.

632
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,470
是的  还有两天呢
Yeah, we have two days.

633
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,760
好吧  看
Okay, here.

634
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,650
那看上去比之前还糟了
That looks worse than it did before.

635
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:26,400
我知道  这是个过程
I know. It's part of the...process.

636
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,140
或许你不该看香肠是怎么做的
Maybe you shouldn't watch how the sausage is made.

637
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,540
你是在看电邮吗
Are you checking your e-mail?

638
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,270
怎么了
What?

639
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,030
没事
Nothing.

640
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,940
不  怎么了
No, what?

641
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,200
你觉得我态度不够认真吗
What, am I not taking this seriously enough for you?

642
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,190
我没那么说
I didn't say that.

643
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,590
你不用说出来  你就这意思
You didn't have to say it. You're acting like it.

644
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,830
我们有考试的小抄了
We've got the cheat sheet to the exam.

645
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,000
我们赢了
We've won.

646
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,170
我就是不想再错过一个机会
I just don't want to miss another opportunity.

647
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,810
两天
Two days.

648
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,250
两天  我没别的要求
Two days. That's all I'm asking for.

649
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,000
你能不能集中注意足够长的时间
Can you just focus long enough

650
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,090
让我们把彗星优化好
for us to get Comet optimized...

651
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,090
-天呐  -等网景发布后  能做到完美加载
- Oh, my God. - ...so that it loads perfectly when Netscape ships.

652
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,010
我很专注了
I'm giving you my focus.

653
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,680
天呐  我是在帮你个忙
Jesus, I'm doing you a favor.

654
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,570
电邮是谁发的
Who's the e-mail from?

655
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,190
阿莱克莎
Alexa.

656
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,520
那去吧
Go ahead.

657
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,020
读吧
Read it.

658
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,930
天
Oh, g--

659
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,020
是新测试版
It's the new beta.

660
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,910
我要替你感谢她吗  还是你想自己编点
Shall I thank her for you, or do you want to compose something

661
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,220
会让她为帮你忙而觉得自己蠢的话
that'll make her feel like a total shitbag for helping you out?

662
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,290
饶了我吧
Give me a break.

663
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,390
好了
Okay.

664
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,930
看上去跟之前的一样
Looks the same as the old one.

665
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:59,830
是啊  外表是一样的  看看运行起来如何吧
Yeah, the skin's the same. Let's see how she runs.

666
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,560
这可比我想的快多了
That's way faster than I thought.

667
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,060
是啊
Yeah.

668
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,110
等等
Hold on.

669
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,950
页面还没完全加载出来你就能输入文字了吗
What, you can put text in fields before the page fully loads?

670
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,430
真是厉害
Really nice touch.

671
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,960
好的  他们支持JPEG图片
Okay, so they've got support for JPEG.

672
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,860
排版太棒了
The formatting is perfect.

673
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,640
我要给吉姆·克拉克打个电话
I'm gonna set a call with Jim Clark.

674
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,760
知道我们可以做什么吗
You know what we could do?

675
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,400
我们可以在主页上放个标签
We could put a badge on our homepage

676
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,160
"已为网景优化"
saying "Optimized for Netscape."

677
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,230
那样gif动图就能流畅...
And the gifs would render smoothly if --

678
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,390
等等
Wait, wait...

679
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,870
那是什么  之前没有的
What is that? That wasn't there before.

680
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,730
雅虎是什么
What the hell is Yahoo?

681
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,610
斯坦福大学俩人做的  以前叫做
Two guys. Stanford. Used to be called

682
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:46,210
"杰瑞和大卫的互联网向导"
"Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web."

683
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,410
但是
But...

684
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:51,360
这好烂  设计得太差了
This sucks. The design's terrible,

685
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,270
也没有图像  而且
there's no image support, they're --

686
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,440
在工具栏上
On the toolbar.

687
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,230
什么
What?

688
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,040
他们在工具栏上
They're on the toolbar.

689
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,790
完了
That's it.

690
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,030
他们赢了
They've won.

691
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,590
他们是网络的名录了
They're the directory to the Web.

692
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,280
我们不存在
We don't exist.

693
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,480
天呐
Oh, God.

694
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,230
拜托
Come on.

695
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,840
乔
Joe.

696
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,570
乔
Joe!

697
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,590
有咖啡
There's coffee.

698
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,630
我不用了
I'm all right.

699
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,820
我希望它成功的
I wanted it to work.

700
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,930
我希望我们成功
I wanted us to work.

701
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,700
是吗
Yeah?

702
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:41,830
我也是
Me too.

703
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:45,990
它成功了
It did.

704
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,200
成功了一阵
For a while.

705
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,630
成功了一阵
For a while.

706
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:58,990
是啊
Yeah.

707
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,670
是达到终点的工具
The thing that gets you to the thing.

708
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,760
是你
It was you.

709
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,370
一直都是你
It was always you.

710
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,530
谢谢  谢谢大家
Thank you. Thank you all.

711
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,760
我们开始吧
Let's, uh, get right down to it, shall we?

712
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,990
很高兴你改主意了
Glad you reconsidered.

713
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,500
我就是为热月龙虾来的
I'm just going for the lobster thermidor.

714
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,810
再回到网络搜索上来
...and to circle back to Web search,

715
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,130
我得知网景本周发行时
I got word that when Netscape launches this week,

716
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:30,110
雅虎将成为默认名录
Yahoo will be the default directory.

717
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,270
他们还有自己的按钮什么的
They've got their own button and everything.

718
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,910
彗星要完了
So Comet is pretty much kaput.

719
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:36,890
而且
And --

720
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,720
那么流浪者呢
Uh-- so, where does that leave Rover?

721
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,260
应该拆分出售  在企业对企业市场上卖掉
Should off-load it for parts, sell it on the B2B market.

722
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,150
幸好  它是基于算法
Lucky for us, it's algorithm-based,

723
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,020
所以还有些价值
so it actually has some value.

724
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,010
有个...什么来着  班基
There's a -- What is it, Benji? It's a...

725
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:49,330
医疗索引公司
medical indexing company

726
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,740
表现出了兴趣
that's actually expressed some interest, so...

727
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:53,950
我们该看看那个
We should probably look into that one

728
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:56,990
努力争取卖到20%到30%的价值
and try to get 20% to 30% of value and --

729
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:58,020
倒回去
Hey, go back.

730
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,260
那个网景的搜索名录叫什么
What is Netscape's search directory called?

731
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,710
是...雅虎
It's, uh...Yahoo?

732
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:07,790
抱歉  是什么
I'm sorry, what is it?

733
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:09,650
"雅虎"
It's "Yahoo"?

734
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,080
雅虎
Ya-hoo?

735
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,090
对  雅虎  就是"呀呼"还有个...
Yeah, Yahoo. Like, "Yahoo," with a...

736
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,850
惊叹号
with an exclamation point.

737
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:19,100
雅虎  还有个惊叹号  不是问号
Oh, Yahoo with an exclamation point, not a question mark?

738
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,310
因为你总是说得像"雅虎?"
'Cause you keep saying Yahoo with a question mark,

739
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,490
-我就...  -好吧
- so I was... -Okay.

740
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,870
应该是  雅虎!吧
Shouldn't it be more like...Yahoo!

741
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:30,890
好吧
Sure.

742
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:32,070
拜托
Come on.

743
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,210
跟我一起深入进去  崔普
Drill down with me now, Trip.

744
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,850
雅虎
Yahoo!

745
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:38,100
雅虎
Yahoo.

746
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,890
不对啊
No, man! No!

747
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:44,160
天呐
Oh, Jesus!

748
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,270
使点劲啊
Now put some mustard on it, you know?!

749
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,550
雅虎
Yahoo!

750
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:49,640
雅虎
Yahoo!

751
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,610
不对  雅虎
No, no, no! Ya-hooooooooo!

752
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,470
雅虎
Ya-hooooooooo!

753
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:02,050
雅虎
Ya-hooooooooo!

Want to thin it down.

46
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,700

也许它已经...到了落叶时节

00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,810
怎么了  没事吧
What's going on? I-Is everything okay?

53
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,670
我能告诉你一些事吗
Can I just tell you something?

54
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,340
好啊  当然可以了
Uh, yeah, o-of course you can.

55
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,530
招待所里有个德国人
Okay, so there's this German guy in the hostel

56
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,410
名叫奥托
named Otto.

57
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,170
是吗  长得帅吗
Oh, yeah? Is he cute?

58
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,260
反正...
Anyway...

59
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,010
他跟我说有个古庙遗迹
he was telling me about this ancient temple ruin.

60
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,860
其实  他一直说个不停
Actually, he was going on and on about it

61
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,550
凌晨三点半我都想睡觉了他还在说
3:30 in the morning while I was trying to sleep

62
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,890
我想拿我的《孤独星球》
and I wanted to bash his head in

63
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,520
拍他的脑袋
with my "Lonely Planet" guide.

64
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,500
但听起来感觉很棒
But it sounded kind of awesome.

65
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,120
那个...神庙遗迹吗
This, uh -- the temple ruin?

66
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,170
是的  那里100多年前被入侵者烧毁了
Yeah, it was burned to the ground by raiders like 100 years ago.

67
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,090
我问奥托我能不能一起去
I asked Otto if I could go with him,

68
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,400
他说可以
and he said yes.

69
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,940
那地方空旷无人
This place was wild, empty.

70
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,980
是一个神圣之城
It was a major shrine city.

71
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,070
我们的导游阿特
Okay, anyway, Aat, our guide,

72
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,410
带我们到一棵树前  那棵树...
he brought us to this tree, and it had this --

73
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,630
里面有一颗砂岩佛祖头
this sandstone head of the Buddha in it.

74
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,640
树根包裹着这颗头
And the roots of the tree had completely grown around it

75
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,170
只露出了它的脸
and covered everything except its face.

76
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,380
然后...
And...

77
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,110
阿特让我们靠近后
Aat had us get on our -- our hands and our knees

78
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,270
得跪在地上
as we got closer to it

79
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,810
因为你不能俯视佛祖
because you can't look down at the Buddha.

80
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,950
必须要尊敬佛祖
You have to be respectful,

81
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,600
所以我们爬了过去
so we crawled up to it,

82
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,730
我伸手去碰了一下那些树根
and, um, I reached out and I-I touched the roots,

83
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,520
阿特将头磕在地上
and Aat put his forehead to the ground...

84
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,700
我们也照做了
so we did, too.

85
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,330
我们不是在拜佛祖
And it's not like we were worshipping the Buddha

86
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,060
或者什么雕像
or the statue, you know?

87
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,300
更像是...
It was, like...

88
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,660
拜这棵树...
more of the tree...

89
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,200
为它屹立至今...
for what it was doing, and...

90
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,780
还有烧毁的石头和草地
burned stones and grass.

91
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,350
反正  然后开始下雨
Anyway, it, um, started to rain.

92
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,200
我把我的前额磕在泥土上时
And when I put my forehead to the mud,

93
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,840
我想到了爸爸
I thought about Dad...

94
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,040
他好像仍然在我身边
...like he was still with me,

95
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,120
只是以另一种方式
Just in, like, a different way.

96
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,620
亲爱的  你说的太美了
Honey, that's beautiful.

97
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,250
挺棒的
It's pretty cool.

98
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,440
我觉得也许你和我  我们其实挺像的
I think maybe you and I, we're actually pretty similar,

99
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,180
所以我们才经常吵架
and maybe that's why we fight all the time,

100
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:03,690
你知道吗
you know?

101
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,990
是啊  是啊
Yeah, yeah.

102
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,320
我知道
I do.

103
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,520
该死  我的电话卡没钱了
Oh, shit, my calling card is running out.

104
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,770
爱你  妈妈  再见
I love you, Mom! Bye!

105
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,070
好了
There.

106
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,630
这样  这幅画应该就画好了
Shoot, I think with that, we about have a finished painting.

107
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,150
祝你好运

No, really.

113
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,420
真希望我们能坚持久一点
Wish we could've done it longer.

114
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,240
你做的决定没错
You made the right call.

115
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,460
正如你所说
Like you said,

116
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,570
坐在这里看着世界毁灭我们
it would've been a bummer to sit around here

117
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,890

158
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,790
就两个
Just two?

159
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,020
好的  好好玩
Okay. Have fun.

160
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,490
那是我的孙子  奥西里斯
That -- That's my grandson, Osiris.

161
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,650
谢谢你
Thanks for your time.

162
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,340
等等  你不做塔罗牌占卜了吗
Wait, don't you want your card reading?

163
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,640
你都付钱了
You paid for it.

164
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,930
请把你的右手放在牌上
Would you please put your right hand on the deck?

165
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,570
好的  谢谢
Okay. Thank you.

166
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,530
过去
Past.

167
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,930
现在
Present.

168
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,870
未来
Future.

169
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,690
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

170
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,710
其实这些牌
Well, you know, they really mean

171
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,950
你想让它们有什么意思就是什么意思
whatever you want them to mean.

172
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,580
就是
Well, you know,...

173
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,770
毁灭
destruction.

174
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,630
-毁灭  -是的
- Destruction? - Yeah.

175
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,890
一般来说
Commonly.

176
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:14,030
悲恸  彷徨  痛苦
Agony, indecision, misery.

177
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,080
天啊
Christ.

178
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,640
所以我又失败了
So I lose again?

179
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,790
好吧
Okay, great.

180
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,490
不  不一定
No. Not necessarily.

181
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,360
因为你看这些阴云
Because, you see, this golden horizon

182
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,630
后面的金色地平线
behind the storm clouds,

183
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,960
可能有点意义
that could be something.

184
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,970
-这张能给我吗  -当然了
- Can I keep this? - Sure.

185
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,310
20元一包牌
I sell packs for another $20.

186
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,150
天啊  你没事吧
Jesus! You okay?

187
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,690
乔·麦克米伦
Joe MacMillan?

188
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,010
就这样  我们在个人电脑行业中完蛋了
And like that, we're getting killed in the PC business.

189
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,080
-谁猜得到呢  -我
- Who'd have guessed, right? - Me.

190
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,020
当然了
Of course.

191
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,750
除了你
Besides you.

192
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,200
乔  我想说
Can I just say, Joe,

193
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,180
看你这么多年一路奋斗走来真的很刺激
it's been a kick watching you carve a path all these years.

194
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,550
一直走在最前面
Always on the bleeding edge.

195
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,210
远超一切
I mean, way out there.

196
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,870
我们不少人
More than a few of us

197
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,280
真的开始相信你的指引了
really grew to trust your finger in the air.

198
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,270
叶子变色了吗
Have the leaves changed yet?

199
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,210
-什么  -东岸那边
- What? - Back east.

200
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,820
嗯  刚开始
Yeah. Just started.

201
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,470
非常美丽
It's gorgeous.

202
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,130
好了  我得去机场了
All right, better get to SFO.

203
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,370
现在都让我们飞商务舱了
They got us flying business class now.

204
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,130
能相信吗
Believe it?

205
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,020
别  我来付
No, please, I got it.

206
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,640
等不及看你接下来的计划了  乔
Can't wait to see what you do next, Joe.

207
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,790
唐娜在快速拨号列表上
Donna is on speed dial.

208
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,360
我们就把你们安排在这里了
I think we're gonna have you guys set up here.

209
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,380
太好了
Okay, great.

210
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,040
太感谢你能接纳我们了
Thank you so much for having us.

211
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,090
-能来这儿我好兴奋  -不用谢我
- I'm so excited to be here. - Don't thank me.

212
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,700
太好了
Yes.

213
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,110
好了  东西在这儿
Okay, so we've got this here.

214
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,230
这看起来太普通了
That's so common.

215
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,420
这边上有按钮
There's, like, buttons on the side.

216
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,930
不不不  约翰
No, no, no, John.

217
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,630
-不  我要  -不  听我的  你得...
- No, I'm gonna -- - No, I'm telling you, you got to --

218
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,400
-我正在这么做  -那是约翰
- I'm trying to do that. - Uh, that was John.

219
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,870
-让我来  -不  我要...
- Let me try. - No, no, I want to --

220
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,880
-让我试试  -至少让我试试吧
- Let me just try it. - Let me at least try.

221
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,150
看着  看着
Look, look, look.

222
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,440
你们要去哪  我买了墨西哥卷
Where you guys going? We got tacos.

223
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,230
卷饼时间  大家伙
Taco time, you guys!

224
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,230
快过来拿
Come and get 'em.

225
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,080
很好
Good.

226
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,600
这是什么  我看到的是什么
What is this? What are we looking at?

227
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,780
这是一个基因片段的十分之一  但...
So, this is one tenth of 1% of one little gene, but this...

228
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,930
你没事吧
Are you all right?

229
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,760
没事
Oh, yeah.

230
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,460
你在飞机上给我的醒鼻凝胶
That nasal gel you gave me on the plane,

231
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,120
感觉就像是一只鼻涕虫爬进了我的鼻子
it feels like a slug crawled into my nose

232
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,270
然后拉了坨屎
and took a dump.

233
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,260
等你没生病时  就会感谢我了
Well, you'll thank me when you don't get sick.

234
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,540
我怎么能为没发生的事感谢你
How will I thank you for something that doesn't happen?

235
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,220
能听到你为什么事感谢什么人会很好的
It would be neat to hear you thank somebody for something.

236
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,030
和顶级投资人在国外待了两个月
Two months abroad with top investors,

237
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,600
我们却还没有什么拿得出手的
and we've got nothing to show for it.

238
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,340
到了奥斯陆以北
Yeah, well, it's tough for the work to translate

239
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,640
就比较难翻译了
once we got north of Oslo.

240
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,940
目的其实在于让你
Well, the point was to get you in good

241
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,390
-认识一些真正的欧洲竞争者  -竞争者
- with some real European players. - Players?

242
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,400
天哪  我都说不出那些人除了
My God, I couldn't tell you what any of those people did

243
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,280
去高档餐厅吃晚饭和抬身价还做了什么
save for go out to dinner at fancy restaurants and name drop.

244
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,940
这一趟到底花了多少钱
How much did this trip even cost?

245
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,670
反正花的是我的钱
Well, it's my money,

246
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,450
我花这钱是为了让你实现你的想法
and I'm spending it to help you bring your ideas to fruition.

247
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,390
-好吧  -但如果你只打算坐在这里
- Okay. - But if you're just gonna sit there

248
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,200
像个只会讽刺人的混蛋一样贬低别人
and cut everyone down like some sardonic asshole --

249
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,080
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

250
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,460
我表现得对你来说不够好
I didn't perform well enough for you.

251
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,740
我不是你的玩偶
I'm not your monkey.

252
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,100
我知道你还在处理一些私人问题
Look, I know that you're still dealing with some personal issues.

253
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,990
或者...可能...
Or...maybe...

254
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,520
你只是失去了兴趣
you're just losing interest

255
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,890
因为现在你需要
because now's the part of the process

256
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,460
真正去做些工作
you actually have to do some work

257
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,740
而不是仅仅吹嘘各种可能性了
and not just bullshit about the possibilities.

258
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,110
能停在这儿吗
Can you pull over here?

259
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,360
卡梅伦
Cameron.

260
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,550
卡梅伦
Cameron!

261
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,890
那你是怎么回家的
How did you even get home?

262
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,700
我走了两公里到了一家麦当劳
Just walked a mile to the McDonald's,

263
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,450
借他们的电话打了个车  花了200美金
used their phone to call a cab, cab cost $200.

264
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,710
你应该打给我的
You should've called me at home.

265
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,240
我可喜欢麦当劳了  他们的小苹果派
I love me some McDonald's -- them little apple pies.

266
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,280
非常美味
Delis-cous.

267
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,970
那之后你们再谈过吗
So, have you talked since?

268
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,810
-两周了  什么动静都没有  -不是吧
- Two weeks. Just radio silence. - Oh, no.

269
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,470
-我觉得是没戏了  -好吧
- So I think that's done. - Yeah.

270
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,850
我记得计算机科学里
You know, there's this thing

271
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,670
有个东西叫
in CompSci I remember --

272
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,110
递归
recursion.

273
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,470
就是一个程序里
Where a specific function

274
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,660
一个函数不断调用自己
calls upon itself repeatedly within a program.

275
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,400
为了解决整个问题
So in order to solve the big problem,

276
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,010
它不断利用小问题作为答案
it uses the same small problem over and over

277
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,760
从而使问题越来越复杂
as the solution to increasingly complex issues.

278
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,720
而这  朋友  就是我软件的原理
And that, my friend, is how my software runs.

279
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,200
顺便说下  乔的事我很遗憾
Sorry about Joe, by the way.

280
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,690
谢谢
Thanks.

281
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,220
其实我还有一些
I actually still have

282
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,860
他的东西需要还
some stuff of his to give back,

283
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,400
但我就是想都不能想
but I just can't bear the thought

284
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,220
现在去见他  你明白吗
of seeing him right now, you know?

285
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,090
我能说句话吗
Can I tell you something?

286
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,940
你说
Yeah?

287
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,250
你心里充满了爱
You got a lot of love in you.

288
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,500
比我认识的任何人都要多
More than anybody I ever met.

289
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,560
它从你心里喷涌而出
It's bursting out of you.

290
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,820
你大口大口地接受这个世界
You're taking the world in these -- in these big gulps,

291
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,700
没法不让自己溺死在里面
and you can't help but to let yourself get drowned in it.

292
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,150
让你迷茫  让你活得好像
Overwhelms you, makes you live like

293
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,830
随时都要爆炸
you're ready to explode at any minute.

294
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,070
他们看不到这点
They don't see it.

295
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,380
而我看到了
I do.

296
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,670
你承受着这样的负担
It's a burden you carry.

297
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,040
你不认为我只是再次逃开吗
You don't think I'm just running away again?

298
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,870
你可能是吧
Oh, I -- you might be.

299
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,620
我在想佛罗里达
I'm thinking about Florida.

300
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,850
佛罗里达  佛罗里达有什么
Florida? What the hell's in Florida?

301
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,030
那里除了鳄鱼和该死的艾波卡特公园还有什么
They got alligators and that dadgum Epcot Center? What?

302
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,380
我妈
My mom.

303
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,980
老天  我只是不想再告别了  你懂吗
Man, I'm just tired of saying goodbye, you know?

304
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:34,880
递归
Recursion.

305
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,470
没错
Exactly.

306
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,990
也许你该让自己犯一次心脏病
Maybe you ought to have yourself a heart attack.

307
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,620
-是吗  -是  对啊
- Yeah? - Yeah, yeah.

308
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,730
当然
Sure.

309
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,670
你知道吗  我倒下时
You know, when I went down,

310
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,290
我尽我所能继续留下
I did everything I could to stay in the ring.

311
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,990
疯狂抵抗
Fought like hell.

312
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,500
我的脑子里在不停念叨
Had this mantra in my head.

313
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,020
撑住  撑住  撑住
"Just stay in it, stay in it, stay in it."

314
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,340
但我当时快输了
But I was losing.

315
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,700
当时我就知道如果我不放弃
I knew at that moment if I didn't give up,

316
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,860
会被杀死的
that guy's gonna kill me.

317
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,640
我
I...

318
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,890
我没有什么可放弃的了
I got nothing left to give up.

319
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,860
我知道  如果你留下来  这很难
I know it's -- If you stay, it's hard.

320
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,690
如果你离开  这也很难  都很难
If you leave, it's hard. It's all hard.

321
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,440
只是
It's --

322
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,600
有时这和你想要什么根本没关系
Sometimes it's not even about what you want.

323
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,670
而是它想让你怎么样
It's about what it wants for you.

324
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,150
你所能做的只有
All you can do is...

325
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,070
聆听  看看你能否听到它在说什么
listen and see if you can hear what it's saying.

326
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,340
它在说再见
It's saying goodbye.

327
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,880
好  那就上路吧
But, yeah, hit the road, then.

328
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,480
我不想和你说再见
I don't want to say goodbye to you.

329
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,940
当然  亲爱的  最好不是永别
Well, hell, sweetheart, it better not be forever.

330
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,990
我可指望你回来呢
I fully expect you to come back

331
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,480
再次让我振奋起来
and shake me all up again.

332
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,730
别让我变老
Don't let me get old.

333
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,220
你是11点半约的那位吗
You're my 11:30?

334
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:44,640
不
No.

335
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,880
看看吧
Have a look around.

336
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,610
拱形天花板
Vaulted ceilings,

337
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,080
天花线  社区环境很好
crown molding, great neighborhood.

338
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,420
上一任租客哪去了
What happened to the previous tenant?

339
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,150
不确定  但这地方已经
Not sure, but this has been on the market

340
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,110
在市场上挂了15天了
something like 15 days now.

341
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,400
你确定停在那儿没事吗
Are you sure it's okay out there?

342
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,900
-嗯  他们会绕路的  -好
- Yeah. I mean, they'll go around. - Okay.

343
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,370
我是你的最后一站  对吧
So, I'm, uh, your last stop, huh?

344
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,830
没错
You are.

345
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,200
我今早去了乔那里
I went by Joe's this morning.

346
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,280
他早就走了
He's totally gone.

347
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,670
我没有
Yeah, I didn't, uh --

348
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,920
房产经纪人说那地方已经空了好几周
the real estate agent told me it'd been empty for weeks.

349
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,440
他没有
He didn't...

350
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,050
抱歉  我以为他会打电话的
I'm sorry, I guess I just thought he would call.

351
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,990
老天  乔
God, Joe.

352
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,260
对  他过来说他要走了
Yeah, he, uh, came by here and said he was leaving

353
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,760
他会保持联系的
and that he'd be in touch.

354
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,050
海莉前几天收到了他的信
Haley got a letter from him a couple days ago.

355
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,030
信
A letter?

356
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,220
我猜我俩都喜欢匆匆离开
Well, I guess we're both fond of rash departures.

357
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,190
你可以给我再给我拿一个那种的吗
Could you just bring me one more of those,

358
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,200
-我觉得这样可以了  -唐娜  抱歉
- and I think we'll be fine. - Donna, sorry,

359
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,850
我得说完  我不是...
I'm gonna finish this. I didn't...

360
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,660
故意突然来打断你的
...mean to just burst in on you and the thing you're doing.

361
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,200
不  别这么说  拜托  这不是
No. No, no, no. Please, it's not...

362
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,770
不如你今晚留下来参加吧
why don't you stay for this thing tonight?

363
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,290
-我觉得你也许会喜欢的  -是吗
- I think you might really dig it. - Yeah?

364
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,620
-觉得我不太符合着装要求  -拜托
- Think I'm a little below dress code. - Oh, come on.

365
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,630
你可以借我的穿
You can just borrow something of mine.

366
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,920
不用了  谢谢  感谢你邀请我
No, thank you. I really appreciate it.

367
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,410
我想在傍晚之前
I just -- I wanted to be in Carson City

368
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,460
到卡森城
come nightfall, so...

369
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,100
-我完全明白  -抱歉借过
- Yeah, no, that makes sense, I guess. - Sorry.

370
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,570
天  抱歉
God. Oh. Sorry.

371
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,600
-对不起  -没事的
- I am sorry. - No, no, it's fine.

372
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,110
是硬木地板
It's hardwood.

373
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,010
听着  我
Hey, look, I --

374
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,300
我也希望我们这几个月
I wish we could've hung out more

375
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,740
能多花点时间在一起
these last couple months.

376
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,270
我明白  我也是
Yeah, I know. Me too.

377
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,920
但是工作太忙了  而且
It's just work has been crazy, and...

378
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,520
你知道吗
Well, you know,

379
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,080
也许我走了之后我们会更常见面
probably we'll end up seeing each other more now that I'm gone,

380
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,760
因为我会来城里
'cause I'll come into town,

381
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,330
我们会好好聚聚
and we'll really make a point of it.

382
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,090
你肯定会回来看阿莱克莎  而且
Yeah, and you'll be back seeing Alexa, I'm sure, and...

383
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:09,820
不
No.

384
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,090
那是过去式了
That's, uh -- That's dead.

385
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,500
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

386
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,790
有些事情就是合不来
You know, some things just aren't the right fit.

387
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:25,990
妈
Mom.

388
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,000
这是我的男朋友凯文
This is my boyfriend, Kevin.

389
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,980
你们好
'Sup?

390
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,780
海莉  卡梅伦要搬走了
Haley, uh, Cameron is moving, I guess.

391
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,550
什么
What?

392
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,840
是的  我要去公路旅行
Yeah, I, uh -- I'm going on a road trip,

393
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,940
等着看会到哪吧
and we'll see, uh, where I -- I end up.

394
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,210
好吧  所有人都要走了
Cool. So everyone's leaving now.

395
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,550
那就  再见
Bye, I guess.

396
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,240
抱歉
Sorry, uh --

397
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,880
-男朋友  -是啊
- Boyfriend? - Yeah.

398
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,690
-门关着你没意见吗  -当然了
- You okay with the door closed? - Oh, yeah, completely.

399
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,940
她只会在里面玩电脑
She just works on her computer,

400
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,160
他就扔沙包玩
and he does the hackey sack.

401
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,310
不出意料
That sounds right.

402
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,060
我觉得她根本就不喜欢他
You know, I get the sense that she doesn't even really like him.

403
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,650
是啊
Yeah.

404
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,810
她在上大学级别的C++课程
She's doing these college-level C++ classes.

405
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,740
在山麓学院  一周上一晚上
It's one night a week at Foothill,

406
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,650
为了这个项目
and she's been just killing herself

407
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:15,580
她都要把自己弄疯了
over this project,

408
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,960
但她很喜欢
but she loves it.

409
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,150
你能相信吗
Can you believe it?

410
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,510
我相信
I can believe it.

411
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:27,610
好了  我要走了  顺便把这番茄扔了
Okay, I'm gonna go, uh, and throw this tomato out.

412
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,200
天  抱歉我没接过来
God, I'm sorry I didn't take that.

413
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,690
不是  来  垃圾放在
No, here, the trash is...

414
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,780
-哪里  -我
- Where? - Hey, I'm...

415
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,580
一路平安
Drive safe, okay?

416
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,540
我会想你的
I'm, uh -- I'm gonna miss you.

417
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,290
唐娜  这
Donna, this is --

418
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,930
海莉
Haley?

419
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:52,800
怎么了
What happened?

420
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,000
我打不开工作文件
I can't open the work file.

421
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,060
我一直在试着打开
I keep trying to open it,

422
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,870
但它提示"驱动器未就绪"
and it says "drive not ready."

423
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,010
你是用沙包砸了电脑吗
Did you hit it with your sack?

424
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,290
-什么  -沙包  凯文
- What? - Hackey, Kev.

425
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,590
没有啊  我就在这儿玩了
No, I've just been chilling here.

426
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,960
这可是我的学期项目
That's my semester project!

427
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,110
-好了  -等等
- Okay. - Hang on.

428
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,950
好了  再试一次
All right, try it again.

429
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,460
是相同的错误提示
It's the same error message.

430
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,390
磁盘没在转
Yeah, the platter's not spinning.

431
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,260
我讨厌这些蠢东西
I hate these stupid things!

432
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,110
深呼吸  凯文  你有钱吗
Breathe. Kevin, do you have any money?

433
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,860
我有感恩节给老人送火鸡
I've got 20 bucks from delivering

434
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,230
赚的20美元
Thanksgiving turkeys to old people.

435
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,550
太好了  那你能帮我个忙
Okay, great, could you do me a favor

436
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,780
带她去看个电影什么的吗
and just take her to a movie or something?

437
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,340
-不  我现在就得做这个  -我知道
- No, I have to do this. - I know.

438
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,110
《星际迷航7:斗转星移》上映了
"Star Trek: Generations" is out.

439
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,940
好吧
Okay, fine.

440
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,190
好吧
Okay.

441
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,150
少来啦
Stop.

442
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,270
知道了
Oh, yeah.

443
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,090
磁头卡在盘片上了
Yeah, the head's stuck to the platter.

444
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,520
如果能取出盘片来
If I can get it off and parked,

445
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,060
我们就得检查数据
we'll have to check the data.

446
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,110
只要能启动
Well, as long as it boots,

447
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,810
我就能检查数据
I can go through the contents.

448
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,500
很抱歉  我知道你想开车走了
Sorry about this. I know you wanted to get driving.

449
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,610
不不
No. No,

450
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,290
我又不是那么急着到卡森城
It's not like I'm desperate to see Carson City.

451
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,900
这听起来可不妙
That didn't sound pretty.

452
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,040
但是  已经快好了
But, hey, there we go.

453
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,940
天呐  我要去准备一下了
God, I got to go get ready.

454
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,960
你能接着弄吗
Can you keep going with this?

455
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,220
好
Yeah, yeah.

456
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,390
怎么样了
How's it going in here?

457
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,510
-老天  -怎么了
- Jesus. - What?

458
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,840
不  就是你  你
No, you just -- you...

459
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,480
就是你打扮得太美了
you just do that so well.

460
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,110
是啊  办一场高级的
Yeah. One of the benefits

461
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,010
鸡尾酒晚宴的好处之一
of throwing a fancy cocktail thing.

462
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,640
怎么样
So?

463
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,790
文件损坏了
Well, the file's damaged.

464
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,600
我试试看
I'm trying to figure out

465
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,890
能不能找到别的法子恢复数据
if I can get a side way in to recover the data.

466
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,780
希望能救回一部分
Well, I hope we can save some of it.

467
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,420
这个怎么玩  踢吗
So, what, do you just kick it?

468
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,640
对  对着自己踢
Yeah, you just -- just kick it to yourself.

469
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,020
取胜诀窍呢
How do you win?

470
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:17,010
用膝盖什么的
You just -- just use your knees and stuff.

471
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,760
我不理解
I don't get it.

472
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,580
我真的很气
You know it really pisses me off,

473
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,090
乔就这样离开了
that Joe would just leave like that.

474
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,090
我们是分手了
Things fell apart, yeah,

475
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,900
但他就这样离开
but for him to just up and...

476
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,060
随便吧
Whatever.

477
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,360
没成
It didn't work.

478
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,450
这里什么都没成  所以
Nothing here did, so...

479
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,150
很抱歉我没告诉你
And I'm sorry that I didn't tell you

480
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,280
我也快要走了
I was leaving sooner.

481
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,690
我就是
I just --

482
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,810
我就是想做个决定
I just wanted to make a decision

483
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,710
不被人劝的回心转意
and not have somebody talk me out of it.

484
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,840
如果你想这么做
Hey, if it's what you want to do,

485
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,310
那就去做吧
it's what you want to do.

486
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,700
是啊
Yeah, man.

487
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,380
如果你一如既往
If you do what you always did,

488
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,050
也也只能得到一贯的结果
you're gonna get what you always got.

489
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,430
如果电梯坏了  就走楼梯
If the elevator's broken, take the stairs.

490
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,290
只要你尝试就会有结果
It works if you work it.

491
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,360
除非有越来越多的解决不了的麻烦
Unless it's more and more of what doesn't work.

492
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,260
匿名见面会上学的
Meetings?

493
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,710
去了几次吧
A few.

494
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,330
你呢
You?

495
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,360
我妈
My mom.

496
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,470
我可能会顺道去看她
I might see her on this trip.

497
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,830
挺好的
That's good.

498
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,890
天  完蛋了
Man, this might be toast.

499
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,410
你把文件转换成
You did copy the file

500
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,470
RTF格式前先复制过了吧
before you converted it to rich text, right?

501
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,960
是的  但我没有转换成RTF格式
Yeah, but I skipped RTF

502
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,430
直接用十六进制编辑器打开了
and went straight to the hex editor.

503
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,380
磁盘头块也重建了  检查下权限
Rebuild the header, too, and check the permissions.

504
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,880
有版本控制也这样做吗
Even if there's version control?

505
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,780
你想恢复数据
You want to recover data

506
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,810
还是想再惹一个15岁的小孩哭
or you want to make a 15-year-old cry again?

507
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,180
好吧
Okay.

508
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,240
要是我们再一起工作呢
What if we worked together again?

509
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,160
那...你有什么点子
What do you, um -- Do you have an idea?

510
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,380
没有  点子可以稍后再想
No, the idea can come later.

511
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,300
那不是重点
That's not what's important.

512
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,640
抱歉
I'm sorry.

513
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,360
这话是有点
That, um -- Oh, God, yeah.

514
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,070
-我  -不不不
- That -- I -- - No. No, no, no, no, no.

515
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,880
-不不不  请忘记我说的话  -抱歉
- No, no, no. Please, forget I said it. - I'm sorry.

516
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,260
我不知道自己在想什么
I -- I don't know what I was thinking.

517
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,620
卡梅隆
Cameron.

518
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,150
抱歉
Sorry.

519
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,580
我去看看办酒宴的人
I'm gonna go check on the caterers.

520
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,660
我马上回来
I'll be back.

521
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,410
那好  我继续想办法
Okay, yeah, I'll keep working on this.

522
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,610
想象一下  我们五个人
So, imagine there are five of us

523
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,460
挤在一辆租来的路虎里
crammed into this rented Land Rover,

524
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,230
而金柏莉又开始晨吐了
and Kimberly already has morning sickness.

525
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,110
而爱尔兰的破路
And the Irish roads are built for,

526
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,870
简直只能跑马车
I don't know, horse-drawn carriages.

527
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,140
而约翰
John --

528
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,280
约翰每看见一朵三叶草
John stops and takes a picture

529
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,630
就要停下来拍照
of every shamrock we see.

530
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,150
每次都停
Every shamrock.

531
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,780
而更重要的是
And more importantly,

532
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,130
你过去这三个月以来
what you have done with the firm

533
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,530
在公司做出的成绩
over the past three months...

534
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,100
谢谢
Thank you.

535
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,850
你的认可真的很重大
That really means a lot.

536
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,560
卡梅伦也来了
Cameron's here.

537
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,540
我还以为她现在得在半个美国开外了
I thought she'd be halfway across the country by now.

538
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,460
我也以为是  她是这么计划的
Yeah, me too. That was the plan.

539
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,870
但是她
But she, um...

540
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,320
她刚刚突发奇想  要和我再次合作
She just floated the idea of working with me again

541
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,400
没来由地就说了
just out of nowhere.

542
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,240
她一半心思想着出远门
With one foot out the door

543
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,990
剩下的生活全塞在一辆房车里吗
and the rest of her life packed in a silver tube?

544
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,900
她就是有这本事
Yeah, well, that is her gift.

545
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,580
异想天开
Thinking of impossible things.

546
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,960
怎么样
Any luck?

547
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,030
好吧
Okay.

548
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,840
电影好看吗
How was the movie?

549
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,620
很奇怪
It was weird.

550
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,550
柯克被困在一个
Kirk was stuck in this, like,

551
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,410
冻结的时间带上
frozen time ribbon thing

552
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,180
然后他重复经历
and he was repeatedly living

553
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,450
他一生最快乐的时光  就这么过了几十年
the happiest part of his life for decades.

554
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,250
然后皮卡德来了  就说
And then Picard comes and he's like,

555
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,080
"哥们  快离开时间带来帮我"
"Dude, get out of the ribbon. You got to help me."

556
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,580
然后柯克就说"成"  然后他就出来了
And so Kirk is like, "Sure," And he does,

557
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,710
然后他  马上就死了
and he, like, immediately dies.

558
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,320
皮卡德真是个混蛋
Picard's a jerk.

559
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,930
你男友哪去了
Where's the Kevinator?

560
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,610
他大概在大吃特吃鞑靼鲔鱼
He's probably wolfing down all the tuna tartare

561
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,420
像条傻梭子鱼似的
like a dumb barracuda.

562
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,450
乔给你写信了吗
Did Joe write you a letter?

563
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,950
写了  怎么了
Yeah. Why?

564
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,890
只是写给我的
it was just to me.

565
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,740
好吧  你说得对  抱歉
Yeah, you're right. Sorry.

566
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,220
你爱过他吗
Did you love him?

567
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,950
是啊
Yeah.

568
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,270
我爱过
I did.

569
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,480
那我  给你简单说说吧
I'll just, like -- I'll just summarize.

570
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:06,030
他大概就是说他需要重新开始
He said he, like, needs to start over,

571
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,870
而且他没有发布那条彗星广告
and that he didn't air the Comet commercial

572
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,520
因为  你懂的
because, you know, um...

573
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,670
他还提到北卡大学
He talked about UNC

574
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,150
把他们的广播节目放上网了
putting their radio station on the Internet.

575
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,010
什么
What?

576
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,180
是个圈内笑话  你不懂
It's an inside joke. You wouldn't get it.

577
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,770
好吧
Yeah.

578
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,800
他说我爸为我感到骄傲
he said that my dad was proud of me

579
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,370
而且如果他有空回来的话
and that if he was ever in town,

580
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:29,090
就来看我们
he'd come and see us.

581
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,900
他还说别忘了他
And he said not to forget him,

582
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,340
哪怕我统治了全硅谷
even when I'm running all of Silicon Valley.

583
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,450
这也是他开玩笑
He's joking again.

584
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,380
阿蒙克是哪里
Yeah, Armonk, where is that?

585
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,450
是他的家乡
it's where he's from.

586
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,590
是IBM的所在地
It's where, uh, IBM is.

587
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,820
我很抱歉没能恢复你的数据
Hey, I'm sorry that we couldn't recover your data.

588
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,170
没事
It's fine.

589
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,640
就像乔说的
Like what Joe said.

590
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,070
说什么了
What's that?

591
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,560
重新开始
Fresh start.

592
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,380
也对
Okay.

593
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,590
好吧
Well...

594
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,530
来时间带找我吧
Come find me in the time ribbon.

595
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,960
我会的
I will.

596
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,030
是啊  挺好的
Yes, good.

597
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,750
抱歉失陪一下
If you'll excuse me one second.

598
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,360
谢谢大家
thank you.

599
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,210
我只是...
I just, uh --

600
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:03,430
我想谢谢你们大家今晚能来
I wanted to thank you guys for coming out tonight.

601
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,320
你们大家[一般指男性]
"You guys."

602
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,000
看看我们的境地
See what we're up against?

603
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:13,210
我1975年从伯克利毕业
When I graduated from Berkeley in '75

604
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:16,020
获得了计算机科学的学位
with a degree in computer science,

605
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,770
没人觉得这有什么大不了的
Nobody batted an eye.

606
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:20,420
那可能是因为那时候
That's probably because back then,

607
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:24,740
程序员就像秘书和工程师
coders were like secretaries and engineers,

608
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,790
就像是装配流水线上的小兵卒
meaning little solder soldiers on the assembly lines,

609
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,540
基本不受重视
were kind of invisible.

610
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,230
我们都习惯了
And we're used to that.

611
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:35,870
但不知何时  这些工作变得非常关键
But somewhere along the line, these jobs became important.

612
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,250
别误会
And don't get me wrong,

613
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,220
我随时乐意和"你们大家"一起聚聚
I'm happy to hang out with "you guys" any time

614
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,580
品尝美食
and eat good food,

615
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,980
但我希望等我女儿到我这个年纪
but I hope that by the time my daughters are my age

616
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,720
她们不用像我们这样聚会
that they don't have to have gatherings like this anymore

617
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:53,030
才能找到自己的存在感
to remind themselves that they're actually here.

618
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:58,890
我在技术行业做了18年
I've been in tech for 18 years.

619
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,220
有过成功
I've won.

620
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,580
有过失败
And I've lost.

621
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,070
作为女人
I am a woman

622
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:10,640
我曾经投票将我的女性合伙人踢出公司
who voted her female partner out of her own company,

623
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,240
那是她所创办的公司
the company she founded.

624
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,790
作为女人  为了这份事业
I am a woman who lost a marriage

625
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,480
我失去了很多
to, among other things,

626
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,620
包括我的婚姻
this line of work.

627
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,130
有时候我夜不能寐
I can't sleep at night sometimes

628
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,340
担心我和我孩子见面的时间不够多
worrying if I'm seeing my kids enough

629
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,830
或者我为她们做的不够多
or if I've been there enough for them

630
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,970
或者现在已经太迟了
or if it's already too late.

631
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,600
但是...
But...

632
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,360
我做到了一些事
...I've done things.

633
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:45,120
那总是需要付出代价  但我还是做到了
That always comes with a price, but I did them.

634
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:50,070
我学到的很多东西之一
One of the many things I've learned

635
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,940
就是不管你做了什么
is that no matter what you do,

636
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,020
总有人在下个路口
somebody is around the next corner

637
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,860
拿着更好的版本
with a better version of it,

638
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,630
如果那是个男人
and if that person is a man,

639
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,190
那就不仅仅是更好
it might not even be better.

640
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,890
还会得到更多关注
It just might get more attention.

641
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,110
有时候  那个人就是你自己
And sometimes, that person is you.

642
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,100
是永远不满足于自己成果的你
The you that's never satisfied with what you just did

643
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,190
因为你很想继续往下探索
because you're obsessed with whatever is next.

644
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:19,410
这是唯一不变的
The one constant is this.

645
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,750
是你  是我们
It's you, it's us.

646
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,960
项目将我们与人联接
The project gets us to the people.

647
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,710
因为正是因为这些人  才有了现在的我
Because it's people that got me where I am,

648
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,540
比如黛安·古德
people like Diane Gould.

649
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,610
比如我丈夫
People like my husband

650
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:40,480
兼第一任合伙人  戈登·克拉克
and my first partner, Gordon Clark.

651
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:45,580
比如我最后一任也是最棒的合伙人
People like my last and best partner,

652
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,920
卡梅伦·豪伊
Cameron Howe.

653
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,160
对于其他所有人
And for all the rest of you,

654
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:54,910
我希望今晚能是一个开始
I hope that tonight can be the beginning of something,

655
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:58,020
今后就算我们
something so that even if we see each other

656
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,300
站在企业竞争的对立面
across the corporate battle lines one day,

657
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,250
你们也知道我支持你们
that you will know that I am rooting for you.

658
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,130
我必须支持
I can't help but not.

659
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,610
因为我的工作是合伙人
Because I am a partner by trade

660
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:13,630
但我天生是一名母亲和姐妹
and a mother and a sister by design.

661
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,940
我...
And I am --

662
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,290
我很自豪能与你们一起走这段路
I am so proud to be on this journey with you.

663
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,690
天啊
Oh, my God!

664
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,280
不  挺好的
No, this is good.

665
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,340
现在大家都知道你是疯姑娘了
Now everyone knows you were the crazy one.

666
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,190
太好了
Oh, good.

667
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,990
很高兴我能派上点用场
Well, I'm glad I could be of some service.

668
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,520
那...
So...

669
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,150
关于我们一起合作
About working together.

670
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,390
对不起
I'm sorry.

671
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,800
那是个糟糕的主意
It was a terrible idea.

672
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,910
我不该提起来的
I shouldn't have brought it up.

673
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,600
你提出这个提议对我来说
I can't tell you what it means to me

674
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,090
意义非常重大
that you asked.

675
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,020
我觉得我在某种意义上...
I think in some ways, I...

676
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,590
可能等这句话等了很多年了
probably have been waiting for years to hear that.

677
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,570
我是认真的
I meant it.

678
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,920
我知道
I know.

679
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,890
当然了  这是最绝对能
Of course, it is also the surest way

680
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,480
搞砸我们现状的办法
to screw up what we do have now.

681
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,290
我们现在是什么
What do we have now?

682
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,960
我们是朋友
We're friends.

683
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,990
也许我们该看看做朋友怎么样
Maybe we should try that for a while.

684
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,590
你掉进池子里
You falling in that pool

685
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,960
大概是我这辈子
was probably the funniest thing

686
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,920
见过的最搞笑的事了
I've ever seen in my entire life.

687
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,900
凯文去哪了
Hey, where's Kevin?

688
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,320
我把他甩了
I dumped him.

689
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,170
那真是  我很遗憾  你还好吗
Oh, that's -- I'm sor-- Are you okay?

690
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,390
挺好的
Yeah.

691
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,470
话说有时候我总是觉得
You know, sometimes I think maybe --

692
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,280
海莉是同性恋
Haley's gay?

693
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,370
-是啊  -是吧
- Yep. - Yeah.

694
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,120
这俩孩子真是  太了不起了
Oh, these girls, they're just...amazing.

695
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,360
话说原来的穆特尼大楼怎么样了
Hey, what's happening with the old Mutiny building?

696
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:31,720
我真不敢相信
I mean, I can't believe

697
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,120
他们花了这么多钱装修
they spent all this money redecorating

698
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,870
却没换锁
and didn't even change the stupid lock.

699
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,390
-还铺地毯了  -是啊
- Whoa, carpet. - Yeah.

700
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,520
看看这一排排玻璃
And look at all this glass.

701
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,630
是啊  这就是彗星
Yeah, this was Comet.

702
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,920
好吧  戈登用了你的办公室
Uh, okay, so Gordon was in your office.

703
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,220
当然了
Oh, of course.

704
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,480
而乔占了我的办公室
And Joe was in mine.

705
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,030
戈登改造了以太网
Gordon rewired the ethernet

706
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,670
从天花板上吊下来
so it patched down through the ceiling,

707
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,470
非常天才
which was really genius.

708
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,030
什么
What?

709
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,550
你记不记得莱夫和悠悠球
You remember when, uh, Lev and Yo-Yo

710
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,670
把装满了海猴子的浴缸
took the fish tank full of sea monkeys

711
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,130
-搬到冰箱旁边了  -记得
- and they moved it over by the fridge? - Oh, yeah,

712
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:15,030
卡尔从上面伸手
and Carl reached over it

713
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,560
过去想拿切达奶酪
trying to get to the Better Cheddars

714
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,410
结果把鱼缸翻在自己身上了
and he spilled it all over himself.

715
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,880
是啊  整条裤子都湿了
Yeah, and he ruined his pants.

716
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,690
-湿得透透的  -所以他不得脱了裤子
- He ruined his pants. - So he had to strip them off,

717
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,550
结果里面穿着  穿着什么来着
and he was wearing-- what was that?

718
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,180
-他穿着那个什么  -就像丁字裤那种
- He was wearing that thing. - It was like a jock strap.

719
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,370
不是不是  是一条比基尼短裤
No, no, no, it was bikini briefs.

720
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,060
天啊  简直像剃光了肉的排骨
Oh, my God. It was like a French cut.

721
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,460
当时他是不是就坐在这儿
Didn't he sit, like, right here?

722
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,520
不是  卡尔在这边  神童旁边
No, Carl, he was over here by Wonderboy.

723
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,850
话说安娜贝尔后来哪去了
Hey, whatever happened to Annabelle?

724
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,590
那个人偶吗
The mannequin?

725
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,740
是啊
Yeah.

726
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,970
博迪在月食之夜
Bodie took mushrooms

727
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,620
服了迷幻药
and immolated her on the roof

728
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,130
在屋顶上把她给献祭了
during a lunar eclipse.

729
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,110
这些人啊
Those guys.

730
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:05,430
你知道博迪都有四个孩子了吗
You know Bodie has four kids now, right?

731
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,210
扯吧你
Get out.

732
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,290
真的
Yes.

733
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:12,230
而且神童去纽约大学教书去了
And, uh, oh, Wonderboy teaches at NYU,

734
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,060
不过他教的是视频艺术
but he teaches, like, video art.

735
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,410
挺好的
Oh, cool.

736
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,560
那卡尔呢
What about Carl?

737
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,330
黄片
Porn.

738
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,650
当然了  他留胡子
Oh, of course, 'cause the mustache.

739
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:25,870
不是  他
No, he --

740
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:29,170
他在一个网站做主播  还收费的
he hosts it on a website and he charges.

741
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,390
他在阿卡迪亚还是哪来着有一栋大房子
He has a huge house out in Arcadia or somewhere.

742
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,010
会是什么样子呢
What would it be?

743
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,480
如果我们重新再来一次的话
If we were to do it all over again?

744
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,540
我已经想不出点子了
I'm out of ideas.

745
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,550
那我们要怎么经营
Okay, then, how would we run it?

746
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,670
这个嘛
Well...

747
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,230
我们会起名叫
we'd call it, um --

748
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,370
比如说
I don't know.

749
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,480
不死鸟
Phoenix.

750
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,400
我喜欢
Oh, I like it.

751
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,250
股权平分
Equal equity.

752
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,410
联合创始
Co-founders.

753
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,870
有平等的决策权
Equal say in everything.

754
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,680
而这一次我们要按自己的节奏扩张
And we'd just grow at our own pace this time.

755
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,410
认真享受这段历程
Like, really enjoy the ride.

756
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:29,330
如果我们做两年的纯研发呢
What if we did 24 months of pure R&D?

757
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:32,420
完全专注于各种超前的创想
Just focus on ideas way outside the box.

758
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,610
还记得我们在不死鸟的第一周吗
You remember our first week at Phoenix?

759
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,170
就你  我  还有那一个我们从
Just you, me, and that one guy we hired

760
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,590
加州理工雇来的人
out of Cal Poly.

761
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,700
我记得我们的首轮融资
I remember our Series A.

762
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,620
然后我们上市了
And then we went public.

763
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,430
嗯
Right.

764
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,780
我们得开始做艰难决定
We had to start making some hard decisions,

765
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,000
或许跟更大的公司合伙
maybe a partnership with a bigger company,

766
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,440
只能牺牲一些公司文化
and we had to sacrifice some of the culture.

767
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,360
嗯  但还是成功了一阵
Yeah, but it worked for a while.

768
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:05,250
但最终  我们只能解雇了一些人
But eventually we had to let some people go,

769
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,090
梳理组织结构
streamline some things.

770
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:11,740
但还是继续失地
And still we kept losing ground.

771
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,520
我们开始争论公司的走向
We started arguing about the direction of the company.

772
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,720
我制定了维持现状的安全计划
I strategized a safe play to keep things afloat.

773
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,750
而我则固执己见
And I dug my heels in.

774
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,280
我们争执不下
We fought about it.

775
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,260
但这次我们没有因此分裂
But it didn't destroy us this time.

776
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,880
是啊
No.

777
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,910
但我们还是陷入了僵局
But still, we were at an impasse.

778
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,590
不久后
And then soon enough,

779
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,850
就由不得我们决定了
the decision got made for us.

780
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,490
我们以朋友的身份道别了
And we walked away friends.

781
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:58,040
能跟你在不死鸟合作真是个荣幸
It was a pleasure working with you at Phoenix.

782
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,530
我享受其中的每一刻
I loved every minute of it.

783
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:40,030
8, 7, 6, 5,

784
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:44,850
4, 3, 2, 1.

785
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,910
怎么样了
Now, how we doing?

786
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:52,630
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

787
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:56,340
有什么奇怪的感觉吗
Does anything feel weird?

788
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:59,050
因为就是这样
'Cause that's what this is.

789
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:01,210
感觉奇怪
Feeling weird is --

790
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:04,470
才让你知道你还在
is how you know you're still here.

791
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,700
好了  你上次吃饭是什么时候了
All right, now, when was the last time you ate

792
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:17,000
因为人类只需要食物  水和休息
Because all a human needs is food, water, and rest.

793
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,440
你得提醒自己
You got to remind yourself

794
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,810
你只是72公斤的黏液
that you're just 160 pounds of goo

795
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:24,530
身处一个巨大的宇宙里
in the middle of a very big universe.

796
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,280
不管你现在为什么不舒服
So whatever's burning you up right now,

797
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:30,060
要知道那都会过去
just know that it'll fade.

798
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:33,720
每个问题  当时都感觉很大
Every problem feels big in the moment,

799
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,670
但是  戈登  你该懂的
but, Gordon, you know better.

800
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:39,770
所以
So...

801
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:44,580
专注于存在本身
focus on just being being.

802
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:50,610
偶尔把目光从电脑屏幕上挪开
And then try to look up from your computer every once in a while.

803
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,410
我想尽量去看你
I want to try and see you as much as I can,

804
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:06,420
但我接下来几周会穿过塔拉哈西
but I should be through Tallahassee in the next couple weeks, so...

805
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:11,670
我想过去一趟
you know, I thought I could, uh, come by.

806
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:16,680
嗯
Yeah.

807
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,420
好吧  到时见
Okay, well, then I'll see you then.

808
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,020
我会的  妈妈
Yeah, I will, Mom.

809
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,350
好
Okay.

810
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,040
-打通了吗  -嗯
- Did you get her? - Yeah.

811
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:46,550
-好  -嗯
- Good. - Yeah.

812
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,850
这周你挺忙吗
So, it's a busy week for you?

813
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,130
是啊
Oh, yeah, sort of.

814
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:58,880
有家3D成象公司要在计算机分销商展览上亮相
We got a 3-D imaging company presenting at COMDEX,

815
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,050
你懂的  计算机分销商展览嘛
so, you know, it's just COMDEX.

816
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,620
嗯
Yeah.

817
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:06,340
计算机分销商展览
Oh, COMDEX.

818
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:16,730
好了  那出发吧
Okay, well, let's do it.

819
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,180
你24小时前就该出发的
What you tried to do 24 hours ago.

820
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,400
我很高兴我耽搁了
I'm glad I got waylaid.

821
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,470
我也是
Yeah, me, too.

822
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,010
我来请早餐吧
Hey, I'll get breakfast.

823
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:25,940
不不  拿来
Oh, no, no. Give me that.

824
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,390
不不  我们分摊吧
No, no, no. Let's split it.

825
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:29,410
你没工作  省省钱吧
You're unemployed. Save your money.

826
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:31,480
好吧
Fair enough.

827
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,600
外面见
Meet you outside.

828
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:35,340
谢谢
Thank you.

829
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,270
卡梅伦
Cameron.

830
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:33,650
怎么了
What is it?

831
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,020
我有点子了
I have an idea.

832
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:34,270
我先问个问题
Let me start by asking a question.

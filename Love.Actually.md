	在我看来爱似乎无处不在
	Seems to me that love is everywhere.

	而是爱的信息

	如果你仔细找找 你会发现爱其实
	If you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling you'll find that love actually...

	比如说 她要求我 带名模克劳蒂参加葬礼
	that I should bring Claudia Schiffer as my date to the funeral...
	不过她知道我不会理她
	I was confident she expected me to ignore.
	但是有些要求她却坚持到底
	But others she was pretty damn clear about.
	她第一次提到这件事
	When she first mentioned what's about to happen,
	我就说 "除非我死了"
	I said, "over my dead body."
	她说 "不 丹尼尔 死的是我"
	And she said, "No, Daniel, over mine."
	我亲爱的妻子
	And, uh, as usual, my darling girl...
	山姆的妈妈 还是说对了
	and Sam's darling mum, was right.

	你爱他吗?
	Do you love him?
	什么？
	Uh, what?
	我只想问问 也许你很想跟谁聊聊
	No, I just thought I'd ask the blunt question in case it was the right one and you needed someone to talk to about it.
	你想吐露心声却没人敢问 你可能真的想吐露心声
	And no one had ever asked you, so you'd never been able to talk about it even though you might have wanted to.
	不 绝对不是
	No, no. No is the answer. Absolutely not.
	所以你并不爱他 是的
	So, that's a no then? Yes.
	嗯
	Um...
	这个DJ 你觉得怎么样？世上最烂的DJ？
	This D.J., what do you reckon? The worst in history?

	That's quite a few of you. I shouldn't be surprised and a half.

	Thought as much. Do you think everybody knows?
	- 知道 - 卡尔知道吗？- 知道
	- Yes. - Do you think karl knows? - Yes.
	这真是坏消息
	Oh, that is... that is bad news.
	我只觉得你该采取行动了
	Well, I just thought that maybe the time had come to do something about it.
	- 什么行动？- 先邀他喝酒
	- Like what? - Invite him out for a drink, and then after about 20 minutes,
	跟他说你想跟他结婚生宝宝
	casually drop into the conversation the fact that you'd like to marry him and have lots of sex and babies.
	- 你知道我想？- 对
	- You know that? - Yes.
	卡尔也知道
	And so does karl.
	为了大家考虑一下
	Think about it, for all our sakes.

	蜜雅 关小声点好吗
	Mia? Mia, could you turn that down?
	怎么了
	What is that?
	这是摇滚传奇麦比利的圣诞歌
	And that was the Christmas effort by the once-great Billy Mack.
	啊亲爱的 他早就过气了
	Oh, dear me, how are the mighty fallen.
	我敢拍胸脯打包票 这是本世纪最烂的曲
	I could safely put my hand up my arse and say that is the worst record I've heard this century.
	不过巧的是 比利呢
	Oh, and coincidentally, I believe Billy will be...
	是本台另一位DJ的来宾
	a guest on my friend Mike's show in a few minutes'time.
	欢迎你 比利
	Welcome back, Bill.
	欢迎你接受访问
	So, Billy, welcome back to the airwaves.
	你翻唱了"爱无处不在"
	New Christmas single, cover of"Love Is All Around."
	我们把爱改成圣诞节
	Except we've changed the word "love" to "Christmas."
	是的 圣诞节对你很重要吗
	Yes. Uh, is that an important message to you, Bill?
	并不是 麦克
	Not really, Mike.
	圣诞节要跟你爱的人一起过
	Christmas is a time for people with someone they love in their lives.
	- 你没有吗？- 我没有
	- And that's not you? - That's not me, Michael.
	我成名太早 贪图享乐
	When I was young and successful, I was greedy and foolish.
	现在只能孤老度过余生
	And now I'm left with no one, wrinkled and alone.
	多谢了
	Wow. Um, thanks for that, Bill.
	- 谢什么？- 谢谢你说老实话
	- For what? - Well, for actually giving a real answer to a question.
	偶像歌手很少说实话
	Doesn't often happen here at Radio Watford, I can tell you.
	- 你问什么我都老实回答 - 你最棒的炒饭对象？
	- Ask me anything you like, I'll tell you the truth. - Uh, best shag you ever had?
	- 小甜甜布兰妮 - 哇
	- Britney Spears. - Wow.
	开玩笑的啦 她逊毙了
	No, only kidding. She was rubbish.
	我再问你
	Okay. Um, here's one. How do you think...
	你的新歌比得上经典老歌吗
	the new record compares to your old classic stuff?
	拜托 你也知道这首歌逊爆了
	Oh, come on, Mikey. You know as well as I do the record's crap.
	我只希望 今年圣诞节冠军单曲得主 不是七年级偶像歌手
	But wouldn't it be great if number one this Christmas wasn't some smug teenager,
	而是一个想咸鱼翻身的老歌星
	but an old ex-heroin addict searching for a comeback at any price?
	那些男孩团体到了圣诞节
	All those young popsters, come Christmas Day,
	全都会把到漂亮美眉
	they'll be stretched out naked with a cute bird balancing on their balls.
	我却得跟经纪人老乔窝在家里
	And I'll be stuck in some dingy flat with me manager, Joe,
	全世界最丑的男人
	ugliest man in the world.
	唱片卖不好 哪儿都不能去
	Fucking miserable because our fucking gamble didn't pay off.
	小朋友 如果你跟欧巴桑一样 相信世上有圣诞老公公
	So if you believe in Father Christmas, children, like your Uncle Billy does,
	就去买我的烂单曲
	buy my festering turd of a record.
	听听我们是怎么硬拗的
	And particularly enjoy the incredible crassness of the moment...
	在第四句歌词多塞了一个音节
	when we try to squeeze an extra syllable into the fourth line.
	我猜你说的是 # 如果你爱圣诞节 #
	I think you're referring to... # lf you really love Christmas #
	祈祷天公下大雪
	"Come on and let it snow." ouch!
	我再播放一次
	So, uh, here it is one more time.
	今年应景的圣诞单曲
	The dark horse for this year's Christmas number one,
	"圣诞节无处不在"
	"Christmas Is All Around."
	谢谢你 接下来是整点新闻
	Thank you, Billy. After this, the news.
	首相已经有麻烦了吗
	Is the new Prime Minister in trouble already?
	(圣诞节前四周) - 接下来是什么？- 美国总统的来访
	- okay, what's next? - The president's visit. Ah, yes, yes.
	这件事很棘手
	I fear this is going to be a difficult one to play.
	党内同志强烈认为
	Alex? There's a very strong feeling in the party...
	不能像上任首相那样 被牵着鼻子走
	we mustn't allow ourselves to be bullied from pillar to post like the last government.
	这是首次重大的考验 态度必须强硬
	Hear. Hear. This is our first really important test. Let's take a stand. Right.
	没错 我了解 但是我决定
	Right. I understand that, but I have decided... not to.
	这次不要
	Not this time. We will, of course, try to be clever,
	我们不要忘记 美国是全球最强大的国家
	but let's not forget that America is the most powerful country in the world.
	我不要像个任性的小孩
	I'm not gonna act like a petulant child.
	我要跟谁上床才吃得到茶点？
	Who do you have to screw round here to get a cup of tea and a chocolate biscuit?
	是喔
	Right.
	请进
	Yeah, come in.
	这是财政部的文件
	These have just come through from the Treasury.
	- 嗯 嗯 - 这是给你的
	- Uh-huh. - And these are for you.
	- 太好了 谢谢 - 我就希望你会胜选
	- Excellent. Thanks a lot. - I was hoping you'd win.
	我也会对另一个傢伙不错 只是我不会给他巧克力饼干
	Not that I wouldn't have been nice to the other bloke too. Just always given him the boring biscuits with no chocolate.
	多谢了
	Thanks very much.
	娜塔莉
	Thanks, Natalie.
	天啊振作点 拜托 你是首相
	Oh God. Come on. Get a grip. You're the prime minister, for God's sake.
	你觉得我们的新首相怎么样?
	Raise the lamp a bit.
	哦 我挺喜欢他的
	So, what do you reckon to our new prime minister, then? Oh, I like him.
	只是想不通他为什么不结婚
	I can't understand why he's not married, though. Well, you know the type.
	他应该是个工作狂 工作就是他的妻子
	He's, uh, married to his job.
	要不然他就是个同性恋
	Either that or gay as a picnic basket.
	打扰一下
	Um, excuse me.
	茱蒂 你的乳头可不可以低一点 然后稍微向左倾斜
	Judy, if you could just lower the nipples and cheat them a bit to the left.
	好的

	You know perfectly well that any bar anywhere in America...
	至少都有十个辣妹
	contains ten girls more beautiful...
	会想要跟我嘿咻 全英国都没这么多
	and more likely to have sex with me than the whole of the United kingdom.
	屁啦 你疯了
	That is total bollocks.
	- 你是真的疯了 - 没有 她们会把我当成
	- You've actually gone mad now. No, I'm wise.

	我并不喜欢办圣诞派对
	Right, the Christmas party. Not my favorite night of the year...
	所以交给你去安排吧
	and your unhappy job to organize.
	- 说吧 - 很简单
	- Tell me. - Well, it's basic, really.
	先找到场地 多买几瓶酒 多准备一些吃的
	Find a venue, over order on the drinks, bulk buy the guacamole...
	警告女生别接近凯文的咸猪手
	and advise the girls to avoid kevin if they want their breasts un-fondled.

	你不会带
	Oh, Christ, you haven't got some horrible six-foot, tight-T-shirt-wearing
	打扮劲爆的男友吧

	真的吗?
	Really?
	真的
	Right.
	他整天都躲在房间 现在一定也在
	He now spends all the time in his room.
	那没什么 我家那小鬼
	I mean, he'll be up there now. There's nothing unusual about that.
	小柏?
	My horrid son... Bernard?
	他也成天躲在房间里 谢天谢地
	Bernard stays in his room all the time. Thank goodness.
	可是凯伦 他是寸步不离房间
	Yeah, but, Karen, this is all the time.
	我很怕他有问题
	I'm afraid that there's something really wrong, you know?
	这跟他妈的死有关
	I mean, clearly it's about his mum, but Christ, he...
	搞不好他在往眼球注射海洛因
	he might be injecting heroin into his eyeballs for all I know.
	- 十一岁就吸毒？- 也许不是眼球
	- At the age of 11? - Well, maybe not his eyeballs, then.
	是血管好吧
	Maybejust his veins.
	问题是都是他妈妈跟他谈心
	You see, the problem is, it was his mum who always used to talk to him, you know and...
	我不晓得 当继父这档事
	I don't know, the whole stepfather thing...
	突然变得很重要
	seems suddenly to somehow matter like it never did before.
	遇到这种事谁都会很难过
	Listen, it was always going to be a totally shit time.
	你要有耐心
	Just be patient.
	检查他房间有没有针头
	And maybe check the room for needles.
	他偶尔会出来
	And then when he sometimes does come out,
	看起来显然哭过
	it's obvious he's been crying.
	她死得太早了
	It's just such a ridiculous waste.
	现在山姆又这样
	And then if it's going to ruin Sam's life as well...
	我不知道如何是好
	I just don't know.
	振作点
	Get a grip.
	没有人喜欢爱哭鬼 你哭个不停没人会跟你上床的
	People hate sissies. No one's ever gonna shag you if you cry all the time.
	是呀 没错
	Yeah, absolutely.
	好建议
	Helpful.
	那
	So,
	怎么了？山姆
	what's the problem, Samuel?
	是因为妈妈
	Is it just Mum,
	还是别的事
	or is it something else, huh?
	是学校吗
	Maybe... school?
	你被同学欺负了？
	Are you being bullied?
	还是更严重的事
	Or is it something worse?
	你能给我点暗示吗
	Can you give me any clues at all?
	- 你真的想知道？- 我真的想知道
	- You really want to know? - I really want to know.
	就算你帮不上忙也想知道?
	Even though you won't be able to do anything to help?
	就算是这样
	Even if that's the case, yeah.
	是的
	Okay. Well,
	老实说 实际上
	the truth is,
	我爱上了一个人
	actually, I'm in love.
	什么
	Sorry?
	我应该为妈难过 我也难过 可是我爱上了一个人
	I know I should be thinking about Mum all the time, and I am,
	那是她死前的事 我也没办法
	but the truth is I'm in love, and I was before she died, and there's nothing I can do about it.
	你还太小了吧
	Aren't you a bit young to be in love?
	不小
	No.
	好 嗯
	Oh, well, okay, right.
	我真的松了一口气
	Well, I mean, I'm a little relieved.
	为什么
	Why?
	因为我 我以为是更惨的事
	Well, because I thought it would be something worse.
	有比受爱情煎熬更惨的事吗?
	Worse than the total agony of being in love?
	嗯…
	Um...
	没有 你说得对
	No, you're right.
	谈恋爱很痛苦
	Yeah, total agony.

	Thanks. Natalie.
	我开始觉得
	Um, I'm starting to feel...
	每天都见到你有点别扭
	uncomfortable about us working in such close proximity every day...
	因为我对你一无所知
	and me knowing so little about you.
	这是不对的
	It seems, uh... It seems elitist and wrong.
	我没什么特别的
	Well, there's not much to know.
	你住在哪儿呢
	Well, um, where do you live, for instance?
	旺斯沃斯 比较穷那一区

	Right at the end of the high street. Harris Street. Near the Queen's Head.
	是呀 那儿是比较穷
	Oh, yeah, yeah, that is dodgy.
	你跟老公或男友一起住吗
	Um, and, uh, you live with your husband... uh, boyfriend...
	有三个可爱的私生子？
	three illegitimate but charming children?
	没有啦 刚跟男友分手 回去跟爸妈住一阵子
	No, I've, um, just split up with my boyfriend actually, so I'm back with my mum and dad for a while.
	- 很遗憾 - 不 没什么 跟他分手也好
	- Ah. Sorry. - No, it's fine. I'm well shot of him.
	- 他说我太胖了 - 你说什么
	- He said I was getting fat. - I beg your pardon?
	他说没人喜欢有象腿的女人
	He said no one's gonna fancy a girl with thighs the size ofbig tree trunks.
	他并不是一个好人
	Not a nice guy, actually, in the end.
	啊
	Ah.
	你知道
	You know, um,
	身为首相我可以叫人刺杀他
	being prime minister, I could just have him murdered.
	谢谢你 我会考虑的

	- 这出乎意料 - 不应该是这样
	- That is unexpected. - Well, it shouldn't be.
	上一任政府说得很清楚
	The last administration made it perfectly clear.
	我们只是延用他们的政策
	We're just being consistent with their policies.
	恕我直言 这政策很烂
	Well, with all respect, sir, they were bad policies.
	谢谢你 亚历 这件事谈下去也不会有进展

	我们达到了目的
	We, uh, got what we came for,
	英美关系也跟以前一样特殊
	and our special relationship is still very special.
	首相呢?
	And Prime Minister?
	我喜欢关系 这个字眼 涵盖了各种罪恶
	I love that word "relationship." Covers all manner of sins, doesn't it?
	我恐怕它成了个坏关系
	I fear that this has become a bad relationship.
	美国总统想要什么就拿什么
	A relationship based on the president taking exactly what he wants...
	完全不理会对英国来说
	and casually ignoring all those things... that really matter to, um,
	很重要的事情
	Britain.
	英国虽不大 但也曾辉煌一时
	We may be a small country, but we're a great one too.

	David Beckham's right foot.
	贝克汉的黄金左脚
	David Beckham's left foot, come to that.
	欺负我们的朋友不算是朋友
	And a friend who bullies us... is no longer a friend.
	既然对方吃硬不吃软
	And since bullies only respond to strength,
	从现在起我也会更强势
	from now onward I will be prepared to be much stronger.
	请总统先生要有心理准备
	And the president should be prepared for that.
	总统先生 总统先生
	Mr. President. Mr. President.

	别一直猛吃
	Just don't go eating it all yourself,
	你会吃成胖子的
	you're getting chubbier every day.
	我很幸运
	I'm very lucky I've got a constitution...

	It's all just rubbish!
	别管它了
	Just leave it.
	天呀 她跳下去了
	Oh, God, she's in.
	我不下去 她会觉得我很蠢
	Right, and now she'll think I'm a total spaz if I don't go in too.
	靠超冷的!
	(Portuguese) Fuck it's cold.
	靠冷毙了!
	Fuck it's freezing. Fuck.
	这本书最好很赞
	(Portuguese) This stuff better be good.
	不值得
	It's not worth it,
	这可不是莎士比亚
	this isn't bloody Shakespeare.
	我可不想为了一本
	(Portuguese) I don't want to drown...
	我姥姥都能写出的书而淹死

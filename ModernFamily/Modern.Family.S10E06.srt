21
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,880
我不记得家里有买新鲜的蜜桃小翘臀啊
I don't remember buying these fresh peaches.

22
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,870
抱歉  瑟奇
Apologies, Serge.

23
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,310
我妻子克莱尔似乎忘记了
My wife, Claire, seems to have forgotten

24
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,430
我在家里办公
that I'm holding office hours

25
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,820
让房地产入门课的学生来学习
for my Intro to Real Estate class here at home.

26
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,700
所以我十分钟前
So, when I walked to the laundry room

27
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,030
只穿着文胸进洗衣房时...
10 minutes ago in my bra...

28
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,200
时机倒是再合适不过了
That was kind of perfect, actually.

29
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,710
我刚给他讲完  七十年代早期的"建筑"
I had just made a point about how buildings from the early '70s

30
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,630
至今仍出人意料地"坚挺"
were holding up surprisingly well.

31
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,750
或许我该...
So maybe I'll...

32
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,980
-是啊  -是啊
- Yeah. - Yeah.

33
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,980
上课时见  伙计
All right, see you in class, buddy.

34
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,560
多好的孩子
‭What a great kid.

35
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,030
这就是我献身学术界的原因  克莱尔
That's why I chucked it all for a life in academia, Claire.

36
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,740
这感觉太特别了
It's a special feeling

37
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,970
知道这世界某处有个年轻人
knowing that there's a young man walking around out there

38
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,830
是你帮忙打造他的品格  能让你骄傲
who you helped mold, who you can be proud of.

39
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,810
-爸  -你懂吗
- Hey, Dad. - Hey. You know?

40
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,910
你起得真早
You're up early.

41
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,260
你这话什么意思
What are you talking about?

42
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,780
刚才我还从背后抱你来着
I hugged you from behind earlier.

43
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,470
我说"我不记得家里有买六块腹肌[啤酒]啊"
You know, I said, "I don't remember buying this six pack."

44
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,990
然后你用很搞笑的东欧口音说
Then you did that funny Eastern European accent --

45
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,070
"我不想惹麻烦
"I don't want trouble.

46
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,650
我只想学习"
I just want to learn."

47
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,830
我们是否该担忧一下集体性骚扰瑟奇的事
Should we be concerned about group-molesting Serge?

48
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,690
而且你不是再少一个学生
And aren't you at the minimum number of students

49
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,560
-课程就会被取消吗  -不必担心
- before they cancel your class? - ‭Not to worry.

50
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,970
瑟奇很崇拜我  班上其余同学也很靠谱
Serge worships me, and the rest of the class is super solid.

51
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,950
再说  过了今天就不准弃课了
Plus, it's the last day to drop classes anyway.

52
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,910
说到弃课
Oh, speaking of that,

53
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,370
我在考虑放弃历史课
I'm thinking about dropping history.

54
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,680
-为什么  -我觉得很无趣
- How come? - It's not really exciting me.

55
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,560
再说  有份大论文今天该交
Plus, we've got this huge paper due today

56
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,580
我的开始动工计划还没结束
that I haven't quite finished starting.

57
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,390
要写门罗主义
It's on the Monroe Doctrine.

58
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,390
门罗主义
The Monroe Doctrine?

59
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,250
糟糕
Oh, no.

60
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,330
大三历史课
Junior year history class,

61
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,260
我写了一份完美的论文
I wrote the perfect paper.

62
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,070
强力的论点  无可挑剔的辅助论证
Strong thesis, impeccable supporting arguments.

63
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,610
我引用了一位白宫侍从的信件
I quoted from the letters of a White House footman

64
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,230
他回忆道  门罗在浴缸中叫他
who recalled Monroe calling to him from the bath,

65
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,920
"博勒加德  把我的马裤给我
"Beauregard, fetch me my breeches.

66
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,720
我想到了一个主义"
We have a doctrine!"

67
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,380
我只得了C
I got a "C."

68
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,320
你认为这成绩合理是吗
Oh, so you agree with that grade, huh?

69
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,020
别把我当小孩哄
Don't patronize me.

70
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,700
俱乐部的饮食变得清淡健康多了
The food at the club has gotten so much lighter and healthier.

71
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,370
好几个人心绞痛连续发作
We had a run of angina attacks,

72
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,900
所以我们不得不重视心脏健康
so we had to go heart-healthy.

73
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,050
我们在同一个周末先后失去了
We said goodbye to our social chairman, Herb,

74
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,420
社交主席贺布和黄油喷泉
and our butter fountain in the same weekend.

75
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,500
我很遗憾
Oh, I'm sorry.

76
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,700
普里契特先生
Hey, Mr. Pritchett.

77
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,750
您随时可以结账了
I'll take this when you're ready.

78
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,260
-谢谢你  玛利亚  -玛利亚
- Thank you, Maria. - ‭Oh, Maria,

79
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,480
很美的名字  所以常被歌唱
that's a beautiful name. That's why it's often sung.

80
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,030
但你不会唱的
But you're not going to --

81
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,200
♪万福玛利亚♪
♪ Ave Maria ♪

82
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,640
谢幕  行了  他们刚允许同性恋进门
And curtain. Okay, they just started letting gays in here.

83
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,650
别让他们后悔
Don't make them regret it.

84
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,030
你或许也该告诉夏罗娜[歌名]
You might also wanna tell Sharona

85
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,080
-不要靠近这张桌子  -没错
- to steer clear of the table. - ‭Yes.

86
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,910
反正我或许也该留着精力
Yeah, well, I should probably save my energy

87
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,610
为今晚的演出做准备
for my performance tonight anyway.

88
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,200
见鬼  歌洛莉亚和我买了票要去看...
Oh, darn. Gloria and I have tickets to, um...

89
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,740
别担心  杰  不用你去看
Don't worry, Jay. It's-it's not for you.

90
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,670
太好了  我还真编不下去了
Oh, good. I didn't know where I was going with that.

91
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,100
今晚是莉莉学校的募捐演出
Tonight is a fundraiser at Lily's school.

92
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,090
我们在为孩子们募捐
We're, you know, raising money for the kids.

93
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,270
歌唱与小品之夜
A night of song and sketch.

94
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,260
所有孩子爸爸都要演出  或者说
All the dads are performing. Well...

95
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,750
大多数爸爸
most of the dads.

96
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,670
为你骄傲  儿子
Proud of you, son.

97
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,020
我也不是彻底的胜利
Ah, it's not a complete victory.

98
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,130
我还是得去看的
I still have to watch it, so...

99
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,720
多谢你请客吃早饭  爸
Thanks for breakfast, Dad.

100
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,670
我喜欢和你们俩共度时光
I love spending time with you two!

101
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,500
我每个月在俱乐部有最低消费
Every month I've gotta burn off a minimum at the club,

102
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,250
而我认识的每个人居然都没空
and literally, everybody else I knew was busy.

103
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,270
这也是为什么我送出的好多生日礼物
That's also why I give a lot of birthday presents

104
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,710
都是俱乐部专卖店买的  马克杯
from the pro-shop. You know, mugs

105
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,300
遮阳帽  上面印着"跟我的推杆说去"
and visors that say "Kiss My Putter,"

106
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,740
"挑逗我  小鸟球"
"Talk Birdie To Me."

107
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,970
都是好产品  双赢
Quality items. Everybody wins.

108
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,330
假如你们不着急的话
So, if you're not rushed,

109
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,110
该去我们的水疗享受一下
you should treat yourself to our spa.

110
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,470
去试试看...
You know, get a couple of, uh...

111
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,730
标准按摩套餐
a couple of standard treatments.

112
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,000
你真慷慨
Oh, well, you're so generous.

113
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,140
我想说  我们圣诞时送你的这件衬衫
Might I say you look very handsome

114
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,170
你穿着十分精神
in that shirt we gave you for Christmas.

115
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,780
这款还有"皇后珊瑚粉"  糟糕
They also make it in "Queen's coral" -- oh, no.

116
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,080
我是不是剧透了你的生日礼物
Did I spoil your birthday?

117
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,390
听起来是的
Sounds like you might.

118
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,230
-什么事这么好笑  -不过是
- What's so funny? - Oh, it's just that

119
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,760
我和学校的一个孩子妈互通电邮
I've been e-mailing this mom at school.

120
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,320
我和她一起做志愿者
We both volunteer together.

121
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,820
-你发电邮  -没什么的  听着
- You-you e-mail? - It's harmless. Listen.

122
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,090
"杰  在天文馆和你说笑很开心
"Hey, Jay, enjoyed laughing around the planetarium with you.

123
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,910
你的笑话能把人笑到天外"
Your jokes were out of this world."

124
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,000
好吧  假如没有什么
Hm, okay. So, if it's so harmless,

125
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,950
歌洛莉亚肯定也知道这位妙语撩骚的女士
I'm sure Gloria knows about this flirty quipstress.

126
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,750
别添油加醋
Don't make something out of this.

127
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,900
我的天
Oh, my God.

128
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,550
所以他才穿了这件衬衫
That's why he's wearing the shirt.

129
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,760
因为它能衬托出你的蓝眼睛
Because it makes your blue eyes pop.

130
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,750
我不会让你们俩八婆把这潭水弄浑
I'm not letting you magpies dirty this up.

131
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,370
"把车停在秋千那
"Park by the swings

132
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,350
好帮你把东西拿进来"
so I can help you carry stuff in."

133
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,660
"把车停在秋千那
"Park by the swings

134
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,850
好帮你把东西拿"进"来"
so I can help you carry stuff in."

135
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,700
你们这是抹黑  我走了
You're sullying this, and I'm leaving!

136
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,820
-向你女朋友带好  -她不是我女朋友
- Okay, well, say "Hi" to your girlfriend. - She's not my girlfriend.

137
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,800
我们俩会配成一组的唯一理由
The only reason we're paired together

138
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,430
就是因为我们的孩子在同一个阅读小组
is because our kids are in the same reading group.

139
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,720
去你们的
Damn it!

140
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,390
我太喜欢我们的"哦哟哟"了
I love when we "Ooh."

141
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,660
以前我们经常这样  后来不了
We used to do that all the time, and then we stopped.

142
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,000
-为什么  -我不知道
- Why? - ‭I don't know.

143
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,660
乔
Joe!

144
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,760
为什么我在垃圾桶里
Why did I find your eye patch

145
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,910
-发现了你的眼罩  -我不知道
- in the garbage? - ‭I don't know.

146
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,260
因为你又去扔了一张停车罚单吗
Were you throwing away another parking ticket?

147
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,580
你必须戴上
Okay, you have to put it on.

148
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,050
为什么  我的弱视已经好了
Why? My lazy eye is fixed.

149
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,080
好啦  有我在呢
Okay, I'm over here,

150
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,300
再坚持一周
and it's only one more week.

151
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,680
你看起来很硬汉
And you look tough,

152
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,970
像个小战神
like a little warlord.

153
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,470
利亚姆的妈妈到了
Oh, that's Liam's mom.

154
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,890
放学见
See you after school.

155
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,780
好的宝贝  不过答应我
Okay, papi, but promise me

156
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,280
你一整天都会乖乖
that you're going to wear the eye patch

157
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,990
-戴眼罩  -我会戴的
- the whole day. ‭- I will.

158
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,590
真不敢相信你不信任我
I can't believe you don't trust me.

159
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,790
两天前
Two days ago,

160
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,330
我抓到你想
I caught you trying to copy

161
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,870
用打印机复印20美元
a $20 bill in the printer.

162
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,160
爸爸说等我能自己赚钱[造钱]的时候
Dad says I get to pick what we watch on TV

163
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,270
我就能决定我们看什么节目
when I start making my own money.

164
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,430
上学去吧
Go to school.

165
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,780
要是你们准备好了
If you guys are ready,

166
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,110
我和胡里奥就开始了
me and Julio will get started.

167
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,430
对了  你们是不是在校园操场遇到的呢
Oh, by any chance, did you guys meet down by the schoolyard?

168
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,190
{\an8}"我和胡里奥在操场"是保罗·赛门知名歌曲的歌名

169
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,190
-♪ 我 ♪  -别  别  好了
- ♪ Me ♪ - ‭No -- No. Okay.

170
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,630
就是这里
Oh, that's the spot.

171
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,270
现在我想起来为什么我们
Now I'm remembering why we haven't had

172
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,750
蜜月之后就没有一起做过按摩了
a couples massage since our honeymoon.

173
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,630
阿鲁巴[阿鲁巴岛]
Aruba.

174
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,170
那不是我们度蜜月的地方
That's not where we went.

175
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,000
那是他发出的噪音
That's the noise he made.

176
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,970
阿  鲁  巴
Arrruuuubaaaa.

177
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,130
小卡  你能稍微
Cam, could you just...

178
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,420
稍微  嘘
just...shh.

179
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,220
-抱歉  -谢谢
- I'm sorry. - ‭Thank you.

180
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,490
好了  够了  我今天就到这了
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna call it.

181
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,100
-不做了  -怎么了  他太过火了吗
- Mm-hmm. Nope. - What happened? Was he forward?

182
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,980
不是  我只是无法
No, I just can't relax

183
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,550
在你发出那些声音的时候放松下来
with you making these noises.

184
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,620
那我不发出那些声音就放松不下来
Well, I can't relax without making the noises.

185
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,510
所以我要走了  谢谢你  胡里奥
Which is why I'm leaving. Thank you, Julio,

186
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,210
不好意思  我没记住你的名字
and I'm sorry. I-I didn't catch your name.

187
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,310
我叫啊喂吗喂
It's A-weema-weh.

188
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,310
{\an8}《狮子王》主题曲歌词

189
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,700
祝你们俩好运
Good luck to you both. Okay.

190
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,270
卢克  亲爱的  
Oh, Luke! Honey, hi.

191
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,810
你好啊  妈  一切都好吗
Hey, Mom. Everything all right?

192
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,670
当然  我就是想过来看看
Of course. I just felt like making a stop

193
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,290
社区大学的神圣殿堂
by the hallowed halls of community college.

194
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,110
那些封条是怎么回事
What's with the police tape?

195
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,540
有一些兄弟会的人想把
Oh, some frat guys decided

196
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,760
院长的车开到火人节去
to drive the dean's office to Burning Man.

197
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,630
好吧  反正
Okay. Well, anyhoo,

198
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,920
既然来都来了
since we're here,

199
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,520
在你弃掉历史课之前
before you drop that history class,

200
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,280
能不能把我以前的论文交上去呢
could you possibly turn in an old paper of mine?

201
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,250
我想看看别人的评分
I would love to get a second opinion on it.

202
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,110
当然
Sure,

203
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,130
但是你知道你对我提了一个很奇怪的要求
but you know you just did something weird

204
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,250
而我一个问题都没多问吧
and I didn't ask a single follow-up question?

205
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:39,960
对
Yeah.

206
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,260
你欠我一次这样的请求
You owe me one of those.

207
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,360
你是怎么把以前的论文导进U盘里的
How'd you even get an old paper on a thumb drive?

208
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,560
很容易...
It was easy.

209
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,170
吧
Ish.

210
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,280
那篇久远的论文是老旧的格式
The old paper was on an old format,

211
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,470
但是把几台老机器连接起来
but it was a simple matter

212
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,420
就能很容易地得到
of stringing a couple of old machines together

213
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,630
我需要的东西了
to get what I needed.

214
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,910
好了
All right.

215
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,500
我一直因为完美主义
Yes, I have been accused of having

216
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,750
饱受诟病
a little problem with perfectionism...

217
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,190
♪ 它在运作 ♪
♪ It's working ♪

218
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,360
但是我对于不公也有意见
...but I also have a little problem with injustice,

219
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,660
就像某位美国总统
much as a certain U.S. President had a little problem

220
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,550
对欧洲帝国主义的看法一样  棒
with European Imperialism. Yes!

221
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,650
当然当一个男人这么做的时候  那是教义
Of course when a man does it, it becomes a doctrine.

222
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,020
而当一个女人这样做
and when a woman does it,

223
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,490
她就是歇斯底里
she's hysterical.

224
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,620
我希望你们喜欢数"乌鸦"
I hope you guys like counting "crows".

225
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,600
"一只乌鸦"[第三方契约] 
Es-crows, that is.

226
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,590
这已经成了熟悉的声音
It had become a familiar sound --

227
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,310
我的18个投入的学生笑声合一
my 18 devoted students laughing as one.

228
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,200
只是这次有些不对劲
Only something was different this time.

229
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,480
听起来像是17个
It sounded like 17.

230
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,280
难道中间有人动摇了
Could it be that I had a wobbler in my midst?

231
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,900
果然  佩奇·史蒂文斯
Sure enough, Paige Stevens

232
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,930
正在翻阅课程目录
was going through the course catalog.

233
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,310
要是她走了  我的课程就不足最小人数
If I lost her, I'd be below my minimum 

234
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,720
这门课就会被停
and lose the class.

235
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,380
为了其他17个追梦者
For the sake of those 17 dreamers,

236
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,240
我别无选择  只能施展我的邓菲魅力
I had no choice but to unleash the Dunphy charm.

237
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,080
-佩奇·史蒂文斯  -到
- Paige Stevens. - ‭Present.

238
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,210
我们已经点过名了  你表现得很好
Oh, we already did that part, and you nailed it.

239
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,220
我昨天晚上读了你的文章
I read your essay last night.

240
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,870
你私下跟谁一起学习了
Whom did you study privately with?

241
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,180
-不好意思你说什么  -别装了  佩奇
- I'm sorry? ‭- Come, now, Paige.

242
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,480
你的见解  你的遣词造句
Your insight, your grasp of the vernacular.

243
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,630
是弗里蒙特吗
W-Was it Freemont?

244
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,040
还是某一位欧洲人
Or perhaps one of the Europeans?

245
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,470
沙尔芬贝格
Scharfenbrugen?

246
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,030
-不是  -当然不
- No.‭ - Oh, of course not.

247
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,080
他过着隐居的生活  多年没有收学生了
He lives as a recluse. He hasn't taken students in years.

248
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,290
我是想表达
I'm simply saying

249
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,000
你天生的直觉
that your raw instincts

250
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,740
可能是1994年允许佣金分割以来
may be the best thing to happen to real estate

251
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,890
房地产界的最强福音
since the allowing of split commissions in 1994.

252
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,040
你不是跟我们说那是
Didn't you tell us it was --

253
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,860
我们就不能有一会儿
Can we for one moment

254
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,850
能不是你的瑟奇个人秀吗
have a break from the Serge show?!

255
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,720
向我保证几年后
Just promise me that in a few short years

256
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,300
当你成为下一个弗莱德·邓纳姆时
when you become the next Fred Dunham,

257
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,000
你会回来看我们
that you'll come visit us?

258
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,130
你真的觉得
Do you really think...

259
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,290
我不是觉得
I don't think.

260
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,290
我知道会
I know.

261
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,060
就是那儿  一点奉承
From there, it was a bit of flattery,

262
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,770
一丝鼓励
a dash of encouragement,

263
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,620
佩奇就回心转意了
and Paige was turned.

264
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,840
让我把我们的明星学员
So, if I could paraphrase

265
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,120
刚才指出的点改述一下
what our star pupil just pointed out,

266
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,010
有时候问题只是要
sometimes it's just a matter

267
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,940
找到愿意买复式住宅的复式傻子
of finding the "Dupe" in "Duplex."

268
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,170
那个声音又出现了
And there it was again,

269
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,600
那动听的音乐
that sweet music --

270
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,770
18个人的欢笑声
18 people laughing.

271
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,490
所有人下周再见
I'll see you all next week.

272
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,070
肯定的
Definitely.

273
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,530
还有  我会在家办公
Oh, and I am holding office hours at my house,

274
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,190
欢迎你们随时来访
so feel free to come by any time.

275
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,470
没问题
Oh, cool.

276
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,040
你...
Oh, you --

277
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,640
佩奇
Uh, Paige.

278
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,410
"佩奇·邓菲夫人"
"Mrs. Paige Dunphy"?

279
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,770
诅咒啊
Curses.

280
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,840
我鼓励地太过了
I'd over-wooed my wobbler.

281
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,880
我们今晚还一起吃晚餐吗
Are we still on for dinner tonight?

282
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,040
当然  我大概能在我外公的俱乐部
Yeah, I can probably get us in

283
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,230
弄到打烊前用餐的座位名额
to the late seating at my grandpa's country club.

284
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,610
你能等到六点半吗
Can you hold off 'ti:30?

285
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,930
其实  我在想
Actually, I thought

286
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,010
也许我可以去你家给你做饭吃
maybe I could come over and cook for you.

287
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:30,870
太棒了
Awesome.

288
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,980
这不是我最喜欢的班级爸爸吗
Hey, there's my favorite class dad!

289
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,770
你好啊
Oh, hey. ‭Hey.

290
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,030
帮我系下围裙  好吗
Tie my apron, will you?

291
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,110
我的荣幸
My pleasure.

292
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
不  不是我的荣幸[舒服]  当然不是
Uh, not my -- not my pleasure, of course.

293
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,710
这听起来太奇怪了
That sounds weird,

294
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,290
而我不是奇怪的人
and I'm not a weird man.

295
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,980
米奇和小卡搅乱了我的心
Mitch and Cam got in my head.

296
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,480
我本来和那个有趣妈妈有一段完全无害的关系
I'd had a perfectly innocent relationship with the fun mom,

297
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,430
结果被他们弄得我老有负罪感
but then they got me feeling all guilty.

298
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,610
突然间我在学校提到的每件事
Suddenly I couldn't mention one thing in that school

299
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,630
听起来都像是双关语
without it sounding like a double entendre.

300
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,690
"睡觉"时间
Nap time?

301
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,330
乐趣"地带"
Fun zone?

302
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,800
盒装[阴部]果汁
Juice box...

303
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,150
我有鲜嫩多汁的番茄呢
I got some nice tomatoes.

304
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,430
好
Oh, yep.

305
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,270
-你是不是弄洒了什么  -没有
- Did you spill something? - ‭Huh? No.

306
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,240
我只是在很用心地做披萨
I'm just working hard on this pizza.

307
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,650
我想我得把这个取下来
Guess I ought to take this off.

308
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,720
天啊  没了戒指感觉像裸体了一样
Boy, feels naked without it.

309
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,460
你有过这种感觉吗  像裸体了一样
You ever feel that way? Naked?

310
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,520
我真心想相信乔有戴着他的眼罩
I really wanted to trust that Joe was wearing his eye patch,

311
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,510
但是自从在垃圾箱里发现眼罩之后
but after finding it in the garbage,

312
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,770
我必须得来确认
I had to make sure.

313
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,330
我不想让他把视力给毁了
I didn't want him to mess up his vision.

314
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,860
我认为在这个国家  视力是一个很重要的问题
I think it's a big problem in this country.

315
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,510
我所到之处  总有眯着眼看的男人
Everywhere I look, there are men with googily eyes.

316
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,720
我们来自拍吧
Let's take a selfie

317
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,270
是给学校期刊拍的
for the school newsletter, so...

318
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,640
所以显出那对蓝眼睛来
Flash those baby blues.

319
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,650
你给我的烤箱[子宫]预热了吗
Did you preheat my oven?

320
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,830
我不是故意的
Not on purpose.

321
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,500
你刚才反应可真不小啊
Well, that was quite a little snitfit back there.

322
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
你是想要让我出丑  还是怎么了
Were you trying to embarrass me, or...?

323
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,520
还能有让你更出丑的事吗
Mm, is that even possible?

324
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,810
要赢过在餐厅唱歌
The singing in the restaurants,

325
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,790
或者按摩时为广告的"试音"可不容易啊
your Herbal Essence audition during the massage?

326
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,890
你知道吗  你才是应该羞愧的那个人
You know, you're the one who should be embarrassed.

327
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,230
我的确感到了羞愧  这不正是吵架的原因吗
I am. Isn't that what we're fighting about?

328
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,110
看看你自己  你甚至不敢
Look at you. You can't even put on

329
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,670
在男士换衣间里
your boxer-briefs in a men's locker room

330
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,400
不用遮羞毛巾小短裙就穿上四角裤
without your little terrycloth shame skirt.

331
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,960
这叫做有涵养  小卡
It's called modesty, Cam.

332
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,330
你能把声音放小点儿吗
Can you please just keep your voice down?

333
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,680
好吧  你知道吗  这都是
Yeah, yeah. You know what? Well, it's all

334
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,020
同样的事
part of the same thing.

335
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,750
你知道吗  我一点都不尴尬
You know, I'm not embarrassing.

336
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,830
你就是个无论做什么都会尴尬的人
You're the one that's just embarrassed by everything.

337
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,040
简直是神经病啊
That is crazy --

338
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,010
-感觉这一撞很值得呢  -我很好
- This seems worth it. - ‭I'm fine.

339
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,220
不  你不好  而这影响了我们所有人
No, you're not, and it's affecting all of us.

340
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,100
你总是让我和莉莉闭嘴
You're constantly shushing Lily and me,

341
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,310
责骂我们就因为我们活得大声
scolding us just for living out loud. ‭

342
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,140
我们就不能晚点再说这件事吗
Can we please have this conversation later?

343
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,640
不  不能  因为我会忙着
No, we can't, because I'll be busy

344
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,860
在父亲节目中演出
performing in Fathers' Follies --

345
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,950
另一件因为你太扭捏而不敢做的事
something else you're too self-conscious to do.

346
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,850
你错过了生活  米奇尔
You're missing out on life, Mitchell.

347
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,450
你得不再那么拘束自己
You need to take off your shackles.

348
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,850
让人们看见
Let people see

349
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,530
你是谁
who you are.

350
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,240
我受够了  闪躲的眼神  那些谎言
I've had enough -- the wandering eye, the lies.

351
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,770
我为什么这么紧张  我什么都没做错
Why was I so nervous? I had done nothing wrong.

352
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,820
好吧  我确实有开一些无害的邮件玩笑
Sure, I engaged in some friendly e-mail banter.

353
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,650
我想我意识到了蓝色衣服能衬托我的蓝眼珠
I guess I realized blue shirts make my eyes sparkle.

354
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,540
披萨派对开始前  也许还在停车场
Might have done a few push-ups in the parking lot

355
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,350
做了几个俯卧撑  但那是给所有人看的
before the pizza party, but that's for everybody.

356
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,650
他就是把我当傻瓜
He's trying to make a fool of me.

357
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,570
索尼娅  我得挂了
Sonia, I have to go.

358
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,000
你一整天都到哪里去了
Where have you been all day?

359
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,730
我明白你在暗示什么了  好吧
I see what you're implying. Fine.

360
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,020
她的名字是劳拉  她对我来说什么都不是
Her name is Laura, she means nothing to me,

361
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,190
我把婚戒取掉的唯一原因
and the only reason my wedding ring is off

362
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,650
是我怕戒指丢在她的"面团"里
is 'cause I was afraid I would lose it in her dough.

363
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,010
对不起
I'm sorry.

364
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,730
你到底在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

365
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,110
几封邮件  完全无害的小玩笑罢了
Couple of e-mails. Harmless stuff.

366
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,250
"把车停在秋千那  好帮你把东西拿进来"
"Park by the swings so I can help you carry stuff in."

367
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,130
你就在担心这些啊
These are what you're worrying about?

368
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,070
这些什么都不是啊
There's nothing there.

369
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,280
是吗  米奇和小卡在暗示
Yeah, Mitch and Cam were implying

370
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,850
我跟她之间有不寻常的事情
there was something weird going on.

371
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,710
怎么可能嘛
That's crazy.

372
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,280
她才35岁  还貌美如花
She's, like, 35 and gorgeous.

373
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,520
就是啊
Exactly.

374
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,290
不过  我想你念邮件时
Although, I don't think you read that e-mail

375
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,660
没念出它本身的语气
the only way it could have been read.

376
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,740
其实是这种语气
I mean, it could've gone,

377
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,910
"把车停在秋千那
"Park by the swings

378
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:56,460
好帮你把东西拿"进"来"
so I can help you carry stuff in."

379
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,040
听上去她知道你背不好
Sounds like she knows about your bad back.

380
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,760
杰  小撩一下无伤大雅
Jay, there's no harm in a little flirting,

381
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,000
-特别是你  -此话怎讲
- especially you. - What is that supposed to mean?

382
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,040
你是个好人  你体内自带警报系统
You're a good man. You have, like, a built-in alarm system.

383
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,940
不会让你行差踏错
It keeps you in the right path.

384
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,700
那你在学校为什么那样瞪我
Then why did you shoot me that look at school?

385
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,320
我那是在瞪乔
It was meant for Joe.

386
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,500
我担心他没有你那种强烈的道德心
I worry that he doesn't have your strong conscience.

387
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,070
我害怕他遗传了我家的基因
I worry that he has my family genes

388
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,530
我们说谎都不打草稿
where we can lie and lie and lie and lie

389
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,690
而且不会有丝毫愧疚
without feeling one ounce of guilt.

390
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,660
但你平时没对我说谎吧
Y-You don't lie to me, though, do you?

391
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,800
从没有过
Never.

392
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,580
他来了  我猜他一定会进来
Here he is now. I'll bet he comes in here

393
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,310
为自己说谎道歉
and apologizes for lying.

394
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,390
前提是他遗传了你们家的正直基因
Yeah, if he's like one from your family.

395
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,850
但如果他进来  像个没事人一样
But if he walks in here all easy-breezy

396
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,280
假装自己没做错过任何事
pretending that he didn't do anything wrong,

397
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,030
那他就是百分百拉米雷兹家的人
he's 100% Ramirez,

398
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,540
或者这也不是我们真正的姓
or whatever our real name is.

399
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,380
儿子
Hey, buddy.

400
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,740
对不起  行了吗
I'm sorry, okay?!

401
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,780
戴眼罩的事我说谎了
I lied about wearing my eye patch,

402
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,650
那还只是一系列谎言的开始
and that's only the beginning!

403
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,780
我自行车怎么坏的  我说谎了
I lied about how my bike broke.

404
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,210
我从没遛过斯黛拉
I never walk Stella.

405
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,950
我把她拴在跑步机上
I tie her to the treadmill.

406
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,860
我之前放在枕头底下的三颗掉牙
The last three teeth I put under my pillow

407
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,030
其实都是薄荷糖
were Tic-Tacs.

408
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,620
我是个无可救药的男孩
I'm a terrible boy.

409
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,900
太好了
Oh, good.

410
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,620
他跟你一样软弱
He's weak like you.

411
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,620
{\an8}疯狂爸爸世界

412
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,460
谢谢你  蒂凡尼的爸爸
Thank you, Tiffany's dad!

413
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,980
接下来  请掌声欢迎
And now, please put your hands together

414
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,880
莉莉  哈珀  扎克和丹妮尔的爸爸们
for Lily, Harper, Zack, and Danielle's dads --

415
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,800
"蜜蜂之膝[生意]"组合
The Bees Knees!

416
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,070
爸爸加油  
Go, Dad! Woot, woot!

417
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,420
我是观众席里唯一的爸爸
I was the only dad in the audience.

418
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,040
台下坐着的都是女性和孩子  就我一个男人
It was just me and a bunch of women and children.

419
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,340
{\an8}发生危难时  通常先救妇女和儿童

420
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,340
我感觉自己就像硬挤上救生艇的懦夫
I felt like a coward on a life boat.

421
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,720
小卡说得对  我错过了很多
I mean, Cam was right -- I-I was missing out.

422
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,820
鲍勃  帮我个小忙
Hey, Bob. A quick favor to ask.

423
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,270
如果哈珀不介意
If you don't think Harper would mind,

424
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,510
你能不能把蜜蜂表演服给我穿一下
do you think maybe I could wear the bee costume?

425
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,490
拿去吧  反正我之后还有表演
Take it. I'm in the show later anyways,

426
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,370
在"感恩之父"组合里唱低音部
playing bass with the Grateful Dads.

427
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,660
那就给我吧
Then good, yeah.

428
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,980
天啊  我真为你感到骄傲
Oh, my God. I'm so proud of you!

429
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,610
谢谢  谢谢各位
Thank you. Thank you!

430
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,300
现在请大家安静片刻
And now we'd like to take a moment

431
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,640
我们一起缅怀亲爱的食堂阿姨
to remember our beloved lunch lady,

432
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,310
佩妮·米勒太太
Mrs. Penny Miller.

433
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,610
老天
Oh, my gosh.

434
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,090
你居然这么做了
I can't believe you did that!

435
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,360
-太棒了  -哎呀别夸了
- That was amazing! - Oh, stop it.

436
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:20,870
不
No!

437
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,800
天啊
Oh, God.

438
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,830
我们还没吸取手套的教训吗
Did we learn nothing from the gloves?!

439
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,740
抱歉  抱歉  抱歉  我来  我来
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I got it. I got it.

440
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,470
我来弄  我来处理
I got it. I got it. I got it.

441
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,350
头盘
For starters,

442
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,160
是用我祖母配方做的意大利饺子
my grandmother's ravioli.

443
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,150
看起来很好吃
It looks amazing.

444
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,100
我房间里存着一些红酒  以备不时之需
I've been saving some occasion wine in my room.

445
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,040
盒子上的葡萄特性一栏写着"妈妈咪呀"
The grape character on the box is saying "Mamma Mia!"

446
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,040
{\an8}意语的"我的天啊"

447
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,050
所以应该跟意大利料理很搭
so it should go well with Italian.

448
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,870
教授  您好
Hello, Professor.

449
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,600
我...
I, uh...

450
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,170
看来你接受了我提议的"门户开放政策"
I see you took me up on that open-door policy I mentioned.

451
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,140
我不是来问你学习的事
Oh, I'm not here for office hours.

452
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,490
-这是个约会  -毫不意外
- This is a date. ‭- Of course.

453
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,390
我听说披头士乐队的保罗·麦卡尼当红时
I've heard things like this happened to Paul McCartney

454
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,670
也遇到过这种事
at the height of his Beatles fame.

455
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,850
{\an8}电影讲述有幸福家庭的老帅哥一夜风流后
小三发疯  不断骚扰他全家的故事

456
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,850
典型的《致命诱惑》套路
It was a classic fatal-attraction situation.

457
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,850
我必须做两件事
I had to do two things.

458
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,690
第一  撑过接下来的十分钟
One -- get through the next 10 minutes

459
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,500
拖到弃我课的截止时间过了为止
'til the deadline to drop my class had passed

460
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,380
方法是用诙谐的玩笑转移她的注意力
by distracting her with light banter

461
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,990
和享用她做的托斯卡纳料理  第二
and enjoying her Tuscan cooking, and, two --

462
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,060
{\an8}《致命诱惑》里的情节

463
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,060
确认下她有没有暴打克莱尔并把她绑了起来
check to see if she had beaten and restrained Claire.

464
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,110
我会不会用力过猛了
I'm not coming on too strongly,

465
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,940
穿这条裙子来约会
am I, with this dress?

466
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,330
不会
Oh. No.

467
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,260
很可爱
Lovely.

468
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,610
我对自己的烹饪很没自信
I'm really nervous about my cooking.

469
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,190
如果一个男人没有吃光
If a guy doesn't eat every bite

470
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,850
我祖母的意大利饺子
of my grandma's ravioli,

471
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,060
我会发疯
I go nuts.

472
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,060
我们当然
Well, we certainly...

473
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,380
不希望有这种事发生
don't want that to happen,

474
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,220
对吧
do we?

475
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,790
话说
Now, uh...

476
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,850
你是哪里人
where are you from?

477
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,610
老家在哪里
Originally.

478
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,890
我猜是意大利
I would say Italy,

479
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,140
但你没有口音
but there's no accent,

480
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,410
所以你肯定不是
so, obviously, that's not the case.

481
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,170
卢克
Luke.

482
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,460
卢克  我关于门罗主义那篇论文有消息了吗
Luke, any word on my Monroe Doctrine paper?

483
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,630
其实  我决定
Oh, actually, I decided

484
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,750
不弃那门课了
not to drop that class,

485
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,860
所以把论文交上去好像不太好
so it didn't feel right turning it in.

486
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,040
不过发生了有趣的事
But something funny did happen.

487
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,440
我在电脑上打开了你写的论文
I had your paper open on my computer.

488
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,890
佩奇看到了  以为是我写的
Paige saw it and thought it was mine.

489
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,310
她做了一些很棒的改动
She made some really good changes.

490
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,920
-改动  -是啊
- Changes? ‭- Yeah, well,

491
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,480
她在几个地方直接切入正题
she cut to the chase in a few places,

492
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,730
把结尾部分做了精简
cleaned up the ending.

493
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,290
她其实是历史专业的学生呢
She's a history major, you know.

494
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,140
-懂了  -妈  我...
- Get it. - ‭Mom, I'm...

495
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,670
跟人家还在晚餐约会中呢
kind of in the middle of a dinner date.

496
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,970
是吗  如果你继续约会
Are you? By now you might be

497
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,370
你们说不定电影已经看一半  或者在玩桌游了
in the middle of a movie or a board game.

498
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,080
毕竟我们都知道她这人有多爱做改变
We all know how obsessed she is with changing things.

499
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,510
去把论文给我拿来  卢克
Go get the paper, Luke.

500
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,190
太好了  你没事
Oh, good, you're okay.

501
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,630
谁说老娘没事了
I'm not that okay.

502
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,920
我对这佩奇可不太感冒
I'm not a fan of this Paige.

503
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,660
-她挺狗胆包天  -所以你知道了
- She's got some nerve. - So you're aware.

504
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,170
我当然知道  我清楚知道她毫不介意
Oh, I'm aware. I'm aware that she has no problem

505
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,650
把自己的贱爪伸向
putting her grubby, little paws all over

506
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,100
不属于她的事物上
something that doesn't belong to her.

507
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,980
-我看出你很不爽  -是的
- I can see you're upset. ‭- I am.

508
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,050
我不爽的原因是因为
I'm upset because I basically took

509
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,700
我把史上最无聊的东西拿来并弄得有趣
the most boring thing in history and made it interesting.

510
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,800
她大摇大摆走过来就当成自己的东西拿走
She thinks she can just come in here and just make it hers.

511
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,010
-做梦吧  -我有点被伤到
- No. - ‭Feels a little hurtful,

512
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,500
但她是我的学生  这事对我影响巨大
but she is my student, and I have a lot at stake here,

513
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,570
能求你把这件事留给我自己处理吗
so can I please just handle this myself?

514
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,510
你没吃到意大利饺也不算亏
You didn't miss much with the ravioli.

515
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,730
真正的好戏是我的海鲈鱼
The showstopper is my branzino.

516
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,640
闻起来好香啊
It smells great.

517
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,140
我们家平常没机会吃到鱼
We don't get to have fish around here.

518
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,130
我爸超讨厌吃鱼
My dad hates it.

519
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,680
这是我们的家传食谱
Well, this one's a family recipe,

520
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,870
如果你不爱吃  我可能就得抛弃你了
so if you don't like it, I'll pretty much have to drop you.

521
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,270
既然如此
Well...

522
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,320
那我们还是
let's not have

523
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,700
不要再说
any of that

524
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,250
任何疯话了
crazy...talk.

525
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,470
离时限还有2分钟
Two minutes to deadline.

526
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,340
我不能让她弃了我的课
I couldn't let her drop my class!

527
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,530
现在
Now

528
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,860
继续
...back...

529
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,420
说你是从哪里来的
... to where you're from.

530
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,880
加州恩西诺
Encino.

531
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,090
靠
Damn it.

532
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,820
妈  别生她气  她只是...
Mom, don't be mad at her. She was just --

533
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,280
没  她真的改良了许多
No, she made it better.

534
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,040
我写这句的时候脑子里想什么呢
What was I thinking with this sentence?

535
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,590
"受人敬仰的大律师的论点
"The esteemed barrister's argument was as layered

536
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,130
充满层次  仿佛他的晚宴后马裤一般"
as the cuffs on his after-dinner breeches"?

537
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,470
这是我第三次提到马裤了
That is the third time I mentioned breeches.

538
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,740
我当年是在闹哪样啊
What was I going through?

539
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,310
-我可以走了吗  -可以
- Can I go now? - Yeah.

540
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,940
等等  宝贝
Oh, wait, honey.

541
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,450
我觉得这姑娘挺好
I like this girl for you.

542
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,600
她值得你请她喝比盒装红酒更好的酒
She deserves better than boxed wine.

543
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,610
海莉有瓶好酒藏在床底下了
Haley keeps a nice bottle under her bed.

544
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,110
你好像很喜欢吃这道菜
You really seemed to like that.

545
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,330
-是的  -我可以再去做一份
- Oh, yeah. - ‭I could make another one,

546
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,490
但需要花一点时间
but it would take a while.

547
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,150
我看看  现在是7点了
Let's see. It's 7:00 now --

548
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,710
谢天谢地啊
Oh, thank God.

549
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,450
佩奇  我们得聊聊
Paige, we have to talk.

550
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,110
我可能无意间发出了让你误会的信号
I-I may have sent some signals I didn't mean to send.

551
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,780
尽管如此  你的一些举动
Nonetheless, some of your behavior

552
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,920
老实说  稍微有点不太合适
has been a little inappropriate, frankly,

553
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,740
而且也对我妻子有点不敬
kind of disrespectful to my wife.

554
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,250
等等  别急  别说下去
Oh, wait, hang on. Hang on.

555
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,700
这件事我其实改变心意了
I changed my mind about that.

556
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,420
我不生你气
I am not mad at you.

557
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,030
你所做的事只不过是对
All you did was take an interest in something

558
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,080
我25年前就该丢弃的一件事物起了兴趣
that I should have dropped 25 years ago.

559
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,780
-克莱尔  -我能跑题一下吗
- Um, Claire. - And can I say something else?

560
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,700
我十分支持你们交往
I'm all in favor of this relationship.

561
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,490
-克莱尔  -我不想话说太早带来坏运
- Claire? - ‭I don't want to jinx it,

562
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:33,150
但我觉得你可能真的是他的真命天女
but I think you could be exactly what he needs.

563
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,860
我懂  虽然他看起来像个男人
I know, he may look like a man,

564
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,050
但老实说  在很多方面
but, honestly, in a lot of ways,

565
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,270
他还只是个小男孩
he's still just a little boy.

566
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,860
"房"里的事只能用一团乱来形容
Complete mess in the bedroom.

567
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,880
不过我可以给你个小秘诀
Although, here's a tip for you.

568
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,640
如果你能"驾驭"在他之上  他表现会变好
He actually does respond well if you stay on top of him.

569
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,240
-所以你不介意我跟...  -完全不介意
- So, you're okay with... - Absolutely.

570
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,630
如同某位美国早年前总统说过的
As a certain U.S. President once said,

571
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,130
"让感觉良好的年代开始吧"
"Let the era of good feelings commence."

572
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,930
天啊  这真是我最开心的一天了
Oh, my God! This is the best day ever!

573
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,140
原来佩奇给我做晚餐
So, it turns out Paige was only making dinner for me

574
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,890
纯粹是因为想接近我爸
so she could get close to my dad.

575
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,550
抱歉了  小兄弟  但我警告过大家
I am sorry, buddy, but I did warn everyone

576
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,800
我强大的邓菲魅力了
about the Dunphy charm.

577
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,180
另一件有趣的事情是
It's also a little interesting

578
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,260
佩奇的房产中介父亲在她12岁时
that Paige's Realtor dad abandoned the family

579
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,310
-抛妻弃女跑了  -感觉没关联啊
- when she was 12. - Seems irrelevant.

580
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,810
他也对魔术有过涉猎
He also dabbled in magic.

581
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,060
感觉我们现在完全是在聊两个不同的话题啊
Now we're just having two separate conversations.

582
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,190
你知道她前3任男友都是50岁以上人士吗
Did you know her last three boyfriends were 50?

583
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,580
我劝你还是少花时间去读
Maybe spend a little less time with your nose

584
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,290
你那些心理学的书  多花点时间变性感吧
in that psych book and a little more time being sexy.

585
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,170
等你写完作业了才还给你
You will get this back when your homework is done.

586
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,290
乔  这是什么
Joe, what is this?

587
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,240
我朋友汉娜给我的纸条
Just the notes from my friend Hannah.

588
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,290
朋友吗  我感觉可不是这么一回事
Friend? This doesn't sound to me like that.

589
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,560
这些字条很挑逗呢
This is very flirty.

590
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,300
让我看看
Let me see that.

591
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,740
"亲爱的乔  你想跟我分着吃水果软糖卷吗"
"Dear Joe, wanna share a half of my fruit roll-ups?"

592
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,360
这只是小孩子的童言童语嘛
This is just kids being kids.

593
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,700
好傻好天真
Don't be a fool.

594
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,580
"亲爱的乔  你想跟我
"Dear Joe, wanna share a half 

595
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,190
分着吃水果软糖卷吗"
of my fruit roll-ups?"

596
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,690
你这角度看确实不一样
That's a different spin on it.

597
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,100
你这性感声线以前都躲哪了
Where's that voice been?

598
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,870
念念这条
Done this one.

599
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,820
"下课时间一起跑来跑去好好玩啊"
"It was so fun running at recess."

600
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,850
"兰迪的疹子真的好恶心啊"
"Randy's rash is really gross."

601
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,100
或许我们该上楼"谈谈"
Maybe we should go upstairs.

602
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,400
看你的电影吧  乔
Watch your movie, Joe.

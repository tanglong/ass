	算了 太冒险了 我不干这鸟事了
	Forget it  It's too risky  I'm through doing that shit 
	你每次都这样说
	You always say that, the same thing every time
	我不干了…再也不干了…太危险了…
	I'm through, never again, too dangerous
	我知道我老这么说 可我也一直都是对的
	I know that's what I always say  I'm always right, too 
	但是你过两天就会忘了
	But you forget about it in a day or two 
	“忘记”的日子结束了 “记住”的日子刚刚开始！
	Well, the days of me forgetting are over and the days of me remembering have just begun 
	知道么 你每次这样说的时候听起来像什么?
	You know when you go on like this what you sound like?
	像他妈个明智的人
	Sound like a sensible fucking man,that's what I sound like. 
	你像只鸭子 嘎嘎嘎……
	You sound like a duck  Quack, quack, quack   
	相信我 你不会再听到了 以后我再也不冒险了
	Take heart, cause you're never gonna have to hear it again since I'm never gonna do it again
	所以你再也不会听到我叫唤为什么不想冒险了
	you're never gonna have to hear me quack about how I'm never gonna do it again
	得过了今晚
	After tonight
	那我还有一整晚可叫呢
	Correct  I got all tonight to quack 
	再来点咖啡吗?
	Can I get anyone more coffee?
	谢谢你！
	Oh, yes  Thank you 
	不客气
	You're welcome 
	我说 现在这样冒险无异于抢银行
	I mean, the way it is now you're taking the same risk as when you rob a bank 
	甚至风险更大 抢银行还容易些
	You take more of a risk  Banks are easier 
	遇到抢劫 联邦银行根本就不作为
	Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you in any way during a robbery 
	他们有保险的 何必来找死？
	They're insured  Why should they give a fuck?
	你甚至连枪都不用带
	You don't even need a gun in a federal bank 
	听说有个家伙走进银行把大哥大交给出纳员 
	I heard about this one bloke He walks into a bank with a portable phone  He gives the phone to the teller   
	电话那头的人说…
	bloke on the other end of the phone says 
	我们抓住了这个家伙女儿
	We got this guy's little girl
	如果不把所有钱给他 我们就把她杀掉！
	If you don't give him all your money we're gonna kill her
	管用吗?
	Did it work?
	当然管用啦！一个傻瓜拎着支大哥大走进银行…
	Fucking way, it works  That's what I'm talking about! Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone
	一根指头都他妈不必动！
	They don't even lift a fucking finger
	那小女孩呢?
	Did they hurt the little girl?
	谁知道? 也许根本就没有什么小女孩
	I don't know  Probably never was a girl in the first place 
	这故事的重点不是那个小女孩 重点是…
	The point of the story isn't the girl  The point of the story is   
	他们抢银行居然用的是一部大哥大！
	they robbed a bank with a telephone 
	你想抢银行?
	You want to rob banks?
	我没想抢银行 我只是说抢银行比我们之前的活容易多了
	I'm not saying I want to rob banks  If we did, it would be easier than what we been doing 
	不再抢酒行了?
	No more liquor stores?
	刚刚我说的是废话吗？当然不再抢酒行了！
	What we been talking about? Yeah, no more liquor stores 
	越南人、韩国人 他们连英文都他妈不会说！
	Vietnamese, Koreans, they don't even speak fucking English 
	你叫他们“倒空收银机”？他们听得懂个屁啊!
	You tell 'em, Empty out the register  they don't know what the fuck you're talking about 
	和他们根本没法沟通 到时候就只有干掉他们！
	They make it too personal  We keep on, one of these gook fucker's gonna make us kill him 
	我不想杀人
	I'm not gonna kill anybody 
	我也不想
	I don't want to kill anybody, either 
	但是他们会把我们逼到那种你死我亡的境地
	But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us or them 
	如果不是亚洲猪 就是他妈的老不死的犹太佬！
	And if it's not the gooks, it's these old fucking Jews who've owned the store for fifteen fucking generations
	他们经营这些店都他妈十五代了！
	who've owned the store for fifteen fucking generations
	想象下 一个臭老头坐在柜台里
	You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the counter
	（一种大威力手枪）…
	with a fucking Magnum in his hand
	你什么都不带拿支大哥大走进去试试……
	Try walking into one of those places with nothing but a phone 
	看看会是什么结果？我们可不能这么干！
	See how far that gets you  Fuck it  We're out of it 
	那还能干什么？乖乖地找工作么？
	Yeah, well, what then? Day jobs?
	死也不要        那怎么办?
	Not in this life  What, then?
	小弟！咖啡！
	Garcon! Coffee!
	这里
	This place 
	我是小妹！
	Garcon means  boy 
	这里?一间咖啡店?
	This place? A coffee shop?
	有问题吗?
	What's wrong with that?
	没人抢过餐厅   有何不可？
	Nobody ever robs restaurants  Why not?
	酒吧、酒行和加油站
	Bars, liquor stores, gas stations
	抢其中任何一个都会脑袋搬家
	you get your head blown off sticking up one of them
	可是你想想 抢餐馆呢？
	Restaurants, on the other hand,
	肯定打他们个措手不及!
	you catch with their pants down
	因为他们绝对想不到会有人来抢劫
	They're not expecting to get robbed  Not as expecting, anyway 
	我敢打赌这种地方也没人会逞英雄…
	I bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this 
	没错！
	Correct！
	这种地方和银行一样是有保险的
	Same as banks, these places are insured 
	经理 他何必自找麻烦
	Manager    he don't give a fuck 
	他只想在你影响到他晚上的生意之前赶快把你弄走
	He's just trying to get you out the door before you start plugging the diners 
	服务员？少他妈扯了！
	Waitresses? Fucking forget it
	她们才不会为了老板吃子弹
	No way they're taking a bullet for the register
	还有小工 累死累活地工作50小时才挣1美元
	Busboys, some wetback getting paid $1 50 an hour
	会他妈介意你拿他老板的钱？
	really give a fuck you're stealing from the owner?
	那些嘴里含着食物的客人根本就反应不过来 
	Customers sitting with food in their mouths,They don't know what's going on,
	前一分钟还在吃丹佛煎蛋 后一分钟就被人用枪指着脸
	One minute they're having a Denver omelette next minute, someone's sticking a gun in their face 
	所以…我有个主意…
	See, I got the idea
	上次抢酒行的情况还记得吗？
	last liquor store we stuck up  Remember? 
	顾客一直上门
	All the customers kept coming in?
	记得
	Yeah 
	你想到要抢他们的钱包 
	You got the idea taking their wallets 
	那主意很棒！      谢谢！
	Now, that was a good idea  Thank you 
	钱包里的钱比收银机的还多！      没错！
	Made more from the wallets than we did from the register  Yes, we did 
	餐厅里有很多很多顾客……
	A lot of people come into restaurants 
	很多很多钱包……
	A lot of wallets 
	聪明吧?
	Pretty smart, huh?
	太聪明了！
	Pretty smart 
	我准备好了 行动吧 就现在 来吧！
	I'm ready  Let's do it  Right now, right here  Come on 
	好吧! 老规矩 你控制顾客 我搞定雇员
	All right  Same as last time, remember? You're crowd control  I handle employees 
	我爱你南瓜仔！
	I love you, Pumpkin
	我爱你小兔兔！
	I love you, Honey Bunny
	都别动 抢劫了！
	Everybody, be cool! This is a robbery!
	谁他妈敢乱动一下 我就把你们这些杂种统统杀光！
	Any of you fucking pricks move and I'll execute every motherfucking last one of you!
	那么 再跟我讲讲那些地下酒吧
	OK, so tell me again about the hash bars 
	想听点什么?
	OK  What you want to know?
	在那儿吸大麻是合法的对吗?
	Hash is legal there, right?
	没错 不过不是100%合法 你不能走进一家餐馆 
	Yeah, it's legal, but it ain't 100% legal  You just can't walk into a restaurant   
	然后卷支大麻烟就开始吸
	roll a joint, and start puffing away 
	我的意思是 他们希望你在家里或者指定场所吸
	I mean, they want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places 
	就是那些地下酒吧吗?
	And those are hash bars?
	这么说吧 买大麻烟是合法的 持有大麻是合法的
	Yeah, it breaks down like this  It's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it
	如果你是地下酒吧的老板 出售大麻也是合法的
	and if you're the proprietor of a hash bar it's legal to sell it 
	携带大麻也行 但这并不重要 因为 听好了…
	It's legal to carry it, but    but that doesn't matter cause, get a load of this, all right?
	要是被阿姆斯特丹的条子拦下来 他们搜你身是违法的
	If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam it's illegal for them to search you 
	在阿姆斯特丹警察没有搜身的权力
	I mean, that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have 
	靠 伙计 我要去 这就是我想要的 我他妈也要去！
	Oh, man, I'm going  That's all there is to it  I'm fucking going 
	我就知道你会喜欢这个！
	I know, baby  You'd dig it the most 
	你知道欧洲什么最有意思吗?
	But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?
	什么?      就是那一点点的小差异
	What? It's the little differences 
	就是和我们这里一模一样的东西
	I mean, they got the same shit over there that they got here
	到了他们那里就会有一点点小差异
	but it's just a little different
	举个例?
	Example?
	你可以在阿姆斯特丹的电影院买到啤酒 
	You can go to a movie theater in Amsterdam and buy a beer,
	我说的不是纸杯的那种 他们是用玻璃杯装的
	And I don't mean just like in no paper cup I'm talking about a glass of beer 
	你在巴黎的麦当劳也能买到啤酒
	And in Paris, you can buy a beer at McDonald's 
	（在中国叫吉士汉堡，麦当劳的招牌之一）
	And you know what they call a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in Paris?
	不叫“四分之一磅吉士汉堡” ?
	They don't call it a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese?
	不 伙计 他们那里用公制的 不知道四分之一磅是他妈多重
	No, man, they got the metric system there  They wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter-Pounder is 
	那叫什么?
	What do they call it?
	皇家吉士堡
	They call it a  Royale with Cheese 
	皇家吉士堡?          没错
	Royale with Cheese  That's right 
	巨无霸叫什么呢?
	What do they call a Big Mac?
	巨无霸还是巨无霸不过前面加一个乐字
	Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac 
	乐巨无霸
	Le Big Mac 
	（汉堡王的招牌堡）
	What do they call a Whopper?
	不知道 我没去吃过汉堡王
	I don't know  I didn't go into Burger King 
	你知道荷兰人在薯条加什么代替番茄酱吗？
	You know what they put on French fries in Holland instead of ketchup?
	加什么?          美奶滋（既蛋黄酱）
	What? Mayonnaise 
	我操！           呵呵……
	Goddamn！     Ha ha ha…
	我看他们这么吃的 伙计
	I've seen 'em do it, man. 
	他们他妈的把薯条浸在那鸡巴玩意儿里吃
	They fucking drown 'em in that shit.
	我们真该带带猎枪来处理这种事情
	They fucking drown 'em in that shit  We should have shotguns for this kind of deal
	上面有多少人？
	How many up there?
	三、四个吧
	Three or four 
	包括我们的人?
	That's counting our guy?
	不确定
	I'm not sure 
	所以有可能五个人
	So that means it could be up to five guys up there?
	很有可能
	It's possible 
	真他妈该拿猎枪来的！
	We should have fucking shotguns 
	她叫什么?
	What's her name?
	米娅        米娅?
	Mia  Mia?
	马瑟勒斯怎么认识她的
	How did Marsellus and her meet?
	谁知道呢 就这么认识的
	I don't know  However people meet people 
	她当过演员
	She used to be an actress 
	是吗?她演过什么?
	Oh, really? She do anything I'd have seen?
	我想她最重要的演出就是一个样片儿吧
	I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot 
	“样片”是什么玩意?
	Pilot? What's a pilot?
	呃…看过电视剧吧?
	Well, you know the shows on TV?
	我从不看电视的
	I don't watch TV 
	那你知道有一种发明叫电视机…
	Yeah, but you are aware that there's an invention called television
	电视机上面要演电视节目吧？
	and on this invention they show shows, right?
	知道
	Yeah 
	他们选择电视剧的方式就是先拍一集 这第一集就叫"样片"
	The way they pick TV shows, they make one show  That show's called a pilot 
	拍好就给选片的人看
	Then they show that one show to the people who pick shows   
	根据样片决定哪个可以继续拍下去
	and on the strength of that one show they decide if they want to make more shows 
	被选中的就成为电视节目
	Some get chosen and become television programs
	没被选上就什么也不是
	Some don't, become nothing 
	她演的就什么也不是
	She starred in one of the ones that became nothing 
	你记得那个安特万·罗卡莫拉吗？
	You remember Antwan Rockamora? 
	黑人和萨摩亚人混血的绰号叫“恐怖东尼”的那个
	Half-black, half-Samoan used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror".
	呃…那个胖子吗?
	Yeah, maybe  Fat, right?
	我才不会叫这哥们儿胖子呢 他确实有点超重
	I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat  I mean, he got a weight problem
	（萨摩亚裔通常都超肥的）
	What's the nigger gonna do, he's Samoan
	我知道你说的是谁了他怎么了？
	Yeah, I think I know who you mean  What about him?
	马瑟勒斯把他修理惨了
	Well, Marsellus fucked him up good 
	据说是因为马瑟勒斯·华莱士的老婆
	Word around the campfire is it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife 
	他做了什么？操她了？      不不不 没这么糟
	So, what'd he do, fuck her? No, no, no, no, no  Nothing that bad 
	那是怎么一回事?
	Well, then, what, then?
	替她做了脚部按摩
	Gave her a foot massage
	脚部按摩？
	A foot massage?
	仅此而已?
	That's it?
	马瑟勒斯怎么整的他?
	Then what did Marsellus do?
	派了几个手下去他的住处把他弄到公寓楼的露台上
	Sent a couple of cats over to his place They took him out on his patio, 
	然后拖上阳台 黑鬼从四楼摔了下来
	threw his ass over the balcony  Nigger fell four stories
	楼下有个玻璃顶棚的小花园 像一个温室
	They had a little garden down at the bottom enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse
	那黑鬼就摔里面去了
	Nigger fell through that 
	从那以后 他就变得口吃了
	Since then, he kind of developed a speech impediment 
	太丢脸了！
	That's a damn shame 
	不过他这叫玩火自焚
	But still, I have to say you play with matches, you get burned 
	怎么说?
	What do you mean?
	傻逼才敢替马瑟勒斯·华莱士的老婆做脚部按摩
	You don't be giving Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage 
	是马瑟勒斯太小题大作了吧?
	You don't think he overreacted?
	安特万大概没有料到马瑟勒斯的反应这么强烈
	Well, Antwan probably didn't expect Marsellus to react the way he did,
	但应该知道他肯定会有所反应
	but he had to expect a reaction
	只是脚部按摩 这能有什么？
	It was a foot massage  A foot massage is nothing
	我都会替我老妈做脚部按摩
	I give my mother a foot massage
	不 这是用手暧昧地抚摸马瑟勒斯的新婚妻子 
	No, it's laying hands in a familiar way on Marsellus' new wife,
	有直接吃她的鲍鱼那么严重吗？没有
	is it as bad as eating her pussy out? No,
	不过他妈的性质也差不多了
	but it's the same fucking ballpark
	 噢！噢！噢！就此打住…
	Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop right there 
	口交和脚部按摩太他妈不同了
	Eating a bitch out and giving a bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fucking thing 
	是不同… 不过也差不多了
	It's not It's the same ballpark 
	不！性质他妈的完全不同！
	Ain't no fucking ballpark, neither 
	也许你按摩的方式和我不同 
	Now, look, maybe your method of massage differs from mine   
	不过把手放在他脚上和把舌头插入她的神仙洞里
	but you know touching his wife's feet and sticking your tongue in her holiest of holies
	不是他妈的相同的性质 是他妈完全不同的两码事！
	ain't the same fucking ballpark It ain't the same league It ain't even the same fucking sport
	脚部按摩根本没什么！
	Look, foot massages don't mean shit 
	你替人脚部按摩过吗?
	Have you ever given a foot massage?
	别在我面前说脚部按摩 我他妈是按摩大师！
	Don't be telling me about foot massages  I'm the foot fucking master 
	经验丰富?
	You given a lot of 'em?
	当然 技术高超 不是盖的
	Shit, yeah  Got my technique down and everything  I don't be tickling or nothing 
	那你会替男人做脚部按摩吗?
	Would you give a guy a foot massage?
	去你的！
	Fuck you 
	你常做吗?          操！
	You given 'em a lot? Fuck you 
	我很累 想来点脚底按摩
	You know, I'm kind of tired  I could use a foot massage myself 
	你再闹 我就要翻脸了
	Yo, yo, yo, man  You best back off  I'm getting a little pissed here 
	就是这里 没错
	This is the door  There it is 
	几点了
	What time you got?
	七点二十二分
	7:22 in the a m 
	还早 来 我们走走
	No, it ain't quite time yet  Come on  Let's hang back 
	我不给男人做脚部按摩不代表马瑟勒斯是对的 
	Just 'cause I wouldn't give no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus
	把安特万从楼上仍进该死的玻璃花房摔成结巴太他妈过份了
	to throw Antwan off a building into a glass motherfucking house fucking up the way the nigger talks
	谁他妈要敢这样对我 他最好快来添我的屁股
	That shit ain't right Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass
	因为我绝对要杀了那狗杂种报仇懂吗？
	cause I'd kill the motherfucker you know what I'm saying?
	我没说他是对的 
	I ain't saying it's right 
	但是你说脚部按摩根本没什么 这我不同意
	But you're saying a foot massage don't mean nothing and I'm saying it does 
	我替很多女人做过脚部按摩 都“有什么”！
	I've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant something 
	大家都心照不宣 所以才他妈很爽！
	Now, we act like they don't, but they do  That's what's so fucking cool about 'em 
	大家都能感觉到那种情欲 但不会说破
	There's a sensuous thing going on where, you know you don't talk about it
	男女各自心知肚明
	but you know it, and she knows it 
	马瑟勒斯很清楚 安特万更他妈清楚
	Fucking Marsellus knew it and Antwan should've fucking better known better 
	伙计 那可是他老婆！可不能拿这事儿开玩笑！
	I mean, that's his fucking wife, man  This ain't a man with a sense of humor about this shit 
	懂我的意思了吗?
	You know what I'm saying?
	很有意思…走吧 该干活了
	It's an interesting point  Come on  Let's get into character 
	她叫什么来着?
	What's her name again?
	米娅  米娅
	Mia  Mia 
	干嘛对老大的女人感兴趣?
	Why you so interested in big man's wife?
	老大要去趟弗罗里达 叫我搞定她
	Well, he's going out of town, Florida and he asked me if I'd take care of her while he's gone 
	搞定她?      别想歪 老兄
	Take care of her? No, man  Just take her out 
	我只是负责陪她寻乐子 不让她无聊而已
	You know, show her a good time  Make sure she don't get lonely 
	你要带米娅·华莱士出去约会?
	You're gonna be taking Mia Wallace out on a date?
	不是约会
	It is not a date 
	就像陪好友老婆出去玩玩
	It's just like if you were going to take your buddy's wife to a movie or something 
	大家开开心罢了
	It's just good company, that's all 
	这不算约会 绝对不算
	It's not a date  It's definitely not a date 
	小崽子们 你们好吗?
	Hey, kids  How you boys doing?

	I can't usually get 'em ' cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian
	她很想把我也变成素食主义者
	which pretty much makes me a vegetarian

	Ooh  This doesn't sound like the usual mindless, boring gettin'-to-know-you chitchat 
	你好像真有话要说
	That sounds like you actually have somethin' to say 
	好吧 没错 没错
	Well, well, I do  I do 
	不过你得保证不能生气
	But you have to promise not to be offended 
	不不不不！
	No! No, no, no 
	我不能做保证
	You can't promise somethin' like that 
	我又不知道你要问什么 
	I have no idea what you're gonna ask me
	我的本能反应可能会生气
	and my natural response could be to get offended 
	所以我不能保证不生气
	I would've broken my promise 
	那就忘了它吧
	Let's just forget it 
	不可能的试图忘记任何有趣的事情都是徒劳的
	That's an impossibilityTrying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility 
	是吗?
	Is that a fact?
	况且 没我允许 问起来会更刺激
	Besides, isn't it more exciting when you don't have permission? 
	好吧 好吧 我就问了
	All right  All right  Well, here it goes 
	安特万是怎么回事?
	What did you, uh, think about what happened to Antwan?
	谁?      “恐怖东尼” 你认识他
	Who's Antwan? Tony Rocky Horror  You know him 
	他从窗台摔下去了
	He fell out of a window 
	嗯 没错 有这种说法 但是另一种说法是他“被”摔下去了
	Mmm  Mmm  Well, that is one way to say it  Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out 
	这种说法还说是马瑟勒斯干的 
	Another way would be was he was thrown out by Marsellus
	甚至说马瑟勒斯把他扔下窗台是因为你
	and yet even another way is to say he was thrown of a window by Marsellus because of you 
	真的吗?
	Is that a fact?
	不 我只是听说而已
	No, no  It's not a fact  It's just what I heard 
	听谁说的?
	Who told you?
	他们
	They 
	他们还真是八卦
	They talk a lot, don't they?
	确实八卦 确实八卦
	They certainly do  They certainly do 
	别害羞 文森特 他们还说了什么?
	Don't be shy, Vincent  What else did they say?
	我不是害羞…呃……
	Well, I'm not    I'm not shy  Um   
	有没有涉及到“F”开头的词?
	Did it involve the F word?
	没有 没有……
	No  No, no, no 
	他们只说安特万替你做脚部按摩
	They just said that Antwan had given you a foot massage 
	还有呢?
	And?
	没啦 没有了
	And    and nothin'  That's it 
	你听说马瑟勒斯把“恐怖东尼”从四楼窗台扔下去
	You heard Marsellus threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a four-story window
	就因为他给我做了脚部按摩？
	for giving me a foot massage?
	对  那你相信吗?
	Mm-hmm  And you believe that?
	听起来似乎有可能
	Well, I mean at the time I was told, it sounded reasonable 
	马瑟勒斯把东尼从四楼窗台扔下去
	Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four-story window 
	就因为他按摩了我的脚 这合理吗?
	for massaging my feet seemed reasonable?
	是有点过 但并不是不可能 我懂的
	No, it seemed excessive but that doesn't mean it didn't happen  I mean, I understand
	我知道马瑟勒斯非常非常爱护你
	that Marsellus is very, very protective of you 
	丈夫爱护老婆是一件事
	A husband being protective of his wife is one thing 
	老婆被人碰了脚就要杀人是另一回事
	A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else 
	不是这样吗?
	But did it happen?
	安特万唯一一次碰我 是握我的手…在我的婚礼上
	Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it…at my wedding 
	真的?
	Really?
	没人知道为什么马瑟勒斯要把东尼从四楼窗台扔出去除了他们自己
	Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus threw Tony out of that four-story window except Marsellus and Tony 
	但是你们这群小流氓比妇女缝纫小组还三八！
	But when you little scamps get together you're worse than a sewing circle

	OK  You're giving her an injection of adrenaline straight to her heart, but she's got a breastplate 
	她隆过胸 你得插深点
	You've got to pierce through that  
	你得快速地刺下去
	You gotta bring the needle down in a stabbing motion 
	我得刺三次吗?
	I gotta stab her three times?
	蠢蛋！一次就够了！
	No! You don't gotta stab her three times  Just once 
	不过你得用力刺穿她的假奶
	But hard enough to get through her breastplate into her heart 
	然后按下针筒
	Once you do that, you press down on the plunger 
	然后会怎样?
	OK, then what happens?
	我也很想知道
	I'm kind of curious about that myself 
	别他妈开玩笑伙计！我会害死她吗?
	This ain't no fuckin' joke, man! Am I gonna kill her?

	我的意见是马瑟勒斯的整个一生
	Well, I'm of the opinion that if Marsellus lived his whole life
	都没有必要知道今天的事
	he don't need to know nothin' about this incident
	要是他知道 我也会和你一样有麻烦
	If Marsellus knew about this incident I'd be in as much trouble as you 
	我看不见得
	I seriously doubt that 
	你不说 我也不会讲
	I can keep a secret if you can 
	握个手？
	Shake on it?
	一言为定
	Mum's the word?
	如果你不怪罪我 那我得回家犯心脏病去了
	Now, if you'll excuse me I'm gonna go home and have a heart attack 
	文森特！想听我的霹雳五狐笑话吗?
	Vincent! Do you want to hear my Fox Force Five joke?
	想… 不过我吓傻了 怕是笑不出来了
	Sure  Except that I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh 
	不 你不笑是因为根本不好笑

	这是昆斯上尉   他和你爸被关在一起
	Well    this here is Captain Koons  He was in the P O W  Camp with Daddy 
	嗨   小伙子  我早就听过你了

	我是你爸爸的好友
	See, I was a good friend of your dad's 
	一起被关在越南五年
	We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together over five years 
	好在你绝不会再去经历这一切
	Hopefully you'll never have to experience this yourself 
	当两个人同甘共苦像我和你爸这么久时
	but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were for as long as we were
	那就必然会承担起另一个人所肩负的责任
	you take on certain responsibilities of the other 
	如果是我没能回来…
	If it had been me who'd not made it
	今天一定是库利奇少校在对我儿子说这番话   吉姆
	Major Coolidge would be talkin' right now to my son    Jim 
	但现实是咱俩在谈话
	But the way it turned out I'm talkin' to you   
	布奇…
	Butch 
	我要给你一样东西
	I got somethin' for you 
	我给你的这块表是你曾祖父在第一次世界大战时买的
	This watch I got here was first purchased by your great-grandfather during the First World War 
	在田纳西诺克斯维尔的小杂货店买的
	It was bought in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee 
	这是首批出厂的手表
	Made by the first company to ever make wristwatches 
	当时的人们还在使用怀表
	Up till then, people just carried pocket watches 
	二等步兵厄瑞纳·库利奇从海上出发去巴黎那天买的
	It was bought by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge on the day he set sail for Paris 
	这就成为那次战争中他不曾离手的战表
	This was your great- grandfather's war watch and he wore it every day he was in that war 
	服完役  他带着这表回老家找你曾祖母
	And when he'd done his duty he went home to your great-grandmother took the watch off   
	把表放在一个旧咖啡罐里 一直放到你祖父戴恩·库利奇
	put it in an old coffee can and in that can it stayed Till your gr anddad, Dane Coolidge   
	又应征入伍 远赴海外再次同德国人作战
	was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the Germans once again 
	这次是第二次世界大战
	This time they called it World War II 
	你曾祖父把表交给你祖父当作吉祥物
	Your great-grandfather gave this watch to your granddad for good luck 
	不幸的是 戴恩没他老爸幸运
	Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's
	他所在的海军陆战队在威克岛一役中全体阵亡
	Dane was a marine, and he was killed along with all the other marines at the Battle of Wake Island
	你祖父知道自己面临死亡
	Your granddad was facing death  He knew it 
	所有的陆战小伙们对活着离开那岛都不存任何幻想
	None of those boys had any illusions about ever leaving that island alive 
	日本军进攻前三天你祖父请求一名空军运输机的枪炮手
	so, three days before the Japanese took the island your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport
	一个叫维努奇的陌生人
	name of Winocki a man he had never met before in his life
	把金表带给他还未曾谋面 刚刚出生的幼子
	to deliver to his infant son who he had never seen in the flesh his gold watch 
	三天后 你祖父牺牲了 维努奇很守信
	Three days later, your granddad was dead but Winocki kept his word 
	战后他去拜访你祖母
	After the war was over he paid a visit to your gr andmother
	给你襁褓中的父亲送去他父亲的金表
	delivering to your infant father his dad's gold watch 
	就是这支表
	This watch 
	你父亲在河内上空被击落时 就带着它
	This watch was on your daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi 
	他被俘后 关进了越南战俘营
	He was captured, put in a Vietnamese prison camp 
	他知道这支表如果被越南猪发现了会被抢走充公
	He knew that if the gooks ever saw the watch they'd confiscate it take it away 
	在你爸看来 这表就是你的传家宝
	The way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright 
	如果被那些猪的脏手碰了他会被诅咒的 于是他藏了起来
	He'd be damned if any slopes put their greasy yellow hands on his boy's birthright, so he hid it 
	有个地方最保险 就是他的屁眼
	in one place he knew he could hide somethin'    his ass 
	五年来他的屁眼一直塞着这玩意
	Five long years he wore this watch up his ass 
	他死于痢疾后 把表交给我
	Then he died of dysentery, he give me the watch 
	我也把这不舒服的金属块儿塞我屁眼两年
	I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass, two years 
	被关七年后 我被送回到家人身边
	Then    after seven years I was sent home to my family  And   
	现在…
	now
	小子 我把表交给你
	little man, I give the watch to you 
	该出场了 布奇
	It's time, Butch 
	正式宣布：威尔森死了
	It's official  It's official  Wilson is dead!
	丹 这是我见过最血腥、最残酷的拳赛！
	Dan, that had to be the bloodiest and the most brutal fight this city has ever seen 
	库利奇已经跑了出去 我从未见过获胜的拳击手这么快地离开拳击场
	Coolidge left faster than I've ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring 
	你认为他知道威尔森死了吗?
	Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?
	我猜他知道 理查德 我能看到他眼神中的疯狂
	My guess would be yes, Richard  I could see the frenzy in his eyes   
	我想无论是谁在这种情况下都会像他那样快速地逃出拳击场
	give way to the realization of what he was doing  I think any man would have left the ring that fast 
	你认为这场悲剧会影响世界拳坛吗?
	Do you feel this tragedy is gonna have an effect on the world of boxing?
	这样的悲剧对拳坛很不利 而且动摇了世界拳坛的基础
	Such a tragedy can't help but shake the boxing world to its very foundations
	但是在接下来的令人难过的几星期中 最重要的是WBA的眼睛仍然紧紧地盯着…

	Well, there's this passage I got memorized  It sort of fits the occasion 
	《以西结书》二十五章十七节
	Ezekiel 25: 17 
	正直之人的道路
	The path of the righteous man
	被小人的自私贪婪和恶人的暴虐专政所笼罩
	is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
	以仁慈善良之名引领弱小穿越黑暗之谷的“牧羊人”
	Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will
	必将得到神的护佑
	shepherds the weak through the Valley of Darkness
	因为他守护兄弟同胞、拯救迷途羔羊
	for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children

	去死吧！狗娘养的 死吧！
	Die, you motherfuckers! Die!
	你怎么没告诉我们厕所里头有人?
	Why the fuck didn't you tell us somebody was in the bathroom?
	你忘了有人在里面还拿着把大枪吗?
	You forget someone was in there with a goddamn hand-cannon?
	你看这枪的尺寸了吗 那把枪比他人还大
	You see the size of that gun he fired at us? It was bigger than him 
	我们早该被射死了 伙计
	We should be fucking dead, man 
	我知道 我们很走运
	 I know  We was lucky 
	不不不 我们不是走运
	No, no, no, no  That shit wasn't luck 
	是吗 也许吧
	Yeah, maybe 
	这是神的干预   知道“神的干预”是什么吗?
	This was divine intervention  You know what divine intervention is?
	知道
	I think so 
	就是神从天上下来 替我们挡住了子弹
	That means that God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets 
	完全正确 就是这意思
	That's right  That's exactly what it means
	神从天上下来替我们挡住了该死的子弹
	God came down from Heaven and stopped these motherfucking bullets
	我想我们该走了 朱尔斯
	I think it's time for us to leave, Jules 
	别不把它当回事
	Don't do that  Don't fucking blow this shit off 
	刚刚在这里发生的是他妈个神迹！
	What just happened here was a fucking miracle 
	算了吧 朱尔斯 只是凑巧罢了
	Chill, Jules  This shit happens 
	错了 你错了！这事绝非偶然
	Wrong  Wrong  This shit doesn't just happen 
	你想在车上 继续研究神学…
	Do you want to continue this theological discussion 
	还是和条子 在监狱里?
	in a car or in a jailhouse with the cops?
	我们应该被打死的伙计
	We should be fucking dead, my friend 
	我他妈要你承认刚刚发生的事是个神迹
	What happened here was a miracle and I want you to fucking acknowledge it 
	好吧 这是个神迹 可以走了吗?
	All right, it was a miracle  Can we go now?
	走吧 小子 快点
	Let's go, nigger  Come on 
	你看过《警察》那片子吗?
	You ever seen that show Cops?
	我看过一集 是有个警察
	I was watching it one time, and there was this cop on
	说他在过道里和歹徒进行的一场枪战
	and he was talking about this gunfight he had in a hallway with this guy, right?
	他对着这家伙打空了子弹 却什么都没打到
	And he just unloaded on this guy and nothing happened  He didn't hit nothing 
	好吧？而他们仅仅是在一条走廊里
	OK? It was just him and this guy 
	我的意思是 虽然很诡异 但就是发生了
	I mean, you know it's freaky, but it happens 
	如果你想当盲人 就跟着牧羊人走 但是我他妈算是想清楚了
	You want to play blind man, go walk with the shepherd but me, my eyes are wide fucking open 
	你他妈说的是什么意思?
	What the fuck does that mean?
	我的意思就是 从现在起 我要退休了
	It means that's it for me  From here on in, you can consider my ass retired 
	我的老天爷      别亵渎神明
	Jesus Christ  Don't blaspheme 
	去他妈的神!     我让你别说了！
	God damn it  I said don't do that 
	你他妈的让我很抓狂
	Why are you fucking freaking out on us?
	我马上告诉马瑟勒斯我不干了
	Look, I'm telling Marsellus today  I'm through 
	你为什么不同时告诉他理由?
	Why don't you tell him at the same time why?
	别担心 我会的
	Don't worry  I will 
	我赌一万块他会笑破肚皮
	Yeah, and I'll bet you $ 10,000 he laughs his ass off 
	我才不在乎
	I don't give a damn if he does 
	马文 你怎么认为?
	Marvin, what do you make of all this?
	我没什么看法
	Man, I don't even have an opinion 
	你肯定有想法的 你认为是神下凡挡住…
	You got to have an opinion  Do you think that God came down from Heaven and stopped   
	你在搞什么鬼? 他妈的!
	What the fuck's happening? Oh, shit, man!
	天啊 我把马文的脸 轰掉了
	Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face 
	你他妈的在干嘛?
	Why the fuck did you do that?
	我不是故意的 纯粹是意外
	Well, I didn't mean to do it  It was an accident 
	什么他妈的屁事我都见过   可是这…
	Oh, man, I've seen some crazy-ass shit in my time
	冷静点伙计 我说了这是意外
	Chill out, man  I told you it was an accident
	很可能 你很可能碾到什么东西了
	You probably You went over a bump or something
	嘿 这车子根本没有撞到什么东西
	Hey, the car didn't hit no motherfucking bump 
	嘿 伙计 我不是故意射这个杂种的 枪突然走火了
	Hey, look, man, I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch  The gun went off  I don't know why 
	很好 瞧你搞得一团糟! 这可是大白天 在城里
	Well, look at this fucking mess, man! We're on a city street in broad daylight 
	我不敢相信      现在就得信 混蛋
	I can't believe it, man  Well, believe it now, motherfucker 
	我们要让这车远离公路
	We got to get this car off the road 
	开着满是血的车会引起警察注意的
	You know, cops tend to notice shit like you're driving a car drenched in fucking blood 
	找个朋友的地方避避不就行了
	Just take it to a friendly place, that's all 
	这里是山谷地带文森特 马瑟勒斯才不会和山谷里的人有交情
	This is the Valley, Vincent  Marsellus ain't got no friendly places 
	朱尔斯 这里他妈也不是我的地盘 伙计
	Jules, this ain't my fucking town, man!
	妈的!
	Shit!
	你在干嘛  打电话给我托卢卡湖的朋友
	What you doing? I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake 
	托卢卡湖在哪？  
	Where's Toluca Lake?
	翻过这座山 布班制片厂旁边
	It's just over the hill here, over by Burbank Studios 
	要是吉米不在家 我真他妈不知到该去哪儿
	If Jimmie's ass ain't home I don't know what the fuck we going to do,
	在818我没有其他朋友了
	man cause I ain't got no other partners in 818
	吉米! 在忙什么?我是朱尔斯
	Jimmie, yo, how you doing, man? It's Jules  Just listen up, man 
	听我说 我和搭档遇到点儿麻烦
	Me and my homeboy are in some serious fucking shit, man
	我们在车里 必须离开公路 马上!
	We're in a car, and we got to get off the road pronto
	我得借你的车库用几小时
	I need to use your garage for a couple hours 
	我们实在应该体谅吉米的处境
	We got to be real fucking delicate with this Jimmie situation
	他一句话就可以把我们赶出去
	He's one remark away from kicking our asses out the door
	如果他那么做了我们该怎么办?
	If he does, what do we do?
	打电话找到救兵前我们不能走 不过我觉得这事不会到那地步
	We ain't leaving till we made a couple calls but I don't want it to reach that pitch 
	吉米是我的朋友 所以你别他家里指手画脚的
	Jimmie's a friend  You don't come into your friend's house and start telling him what's what 
	叫他别太过分就好了
	Just tell him not to be abusive, that's all 
	他看到马文时差点要抓狂
	He kind of freaked out back there when he saw Marvin 
	站在他的角度想想 早上8点 才刚睡醒 对这事丝毫无心理准备
	Well, put yourself in his position  It's 8:00 in the morning  He just woke up  He wasn't expecting this shit 
	别忘了是谁惹的祸 又是谁是在帮忙
	Shit, we got to remember here who's doing who a favor 
	若这意味着我必须讨好他的话 不帮也罢
	If that favor means that I got to take shit then he can stick that favor straight up his ass 
	妈的！你对这毛巾做了什么?
	Nigger, what the fuck did you just do to his towel?
	我只有擦手而已
	I was drying my hands 
	你得先洗了手再擦
	You're supposed to wash them first 
	你看到我洗了的啊
	You watched me wash them 
	我只看到你湿了湿手
	I watched you get them wet 
	我洗了 这玩意很难洗干净
	I was washing them  This shit's hard to get off 
	如果他有熔岩皂 我可能会洗得干净点
	Maybe if he had Lava, I could've done a better job 
	我他妈跟你用的同一块肥皂 我怎么没把毛巾弄得像卫生巾一样?
	I used the same fucking soap you did and the towel didn't look like no goddamn maxipad 
	要是被他进来看见成了这模样怎么办?
	What if he was to come in here and see his towel like this?
	搞得这么糟糕会惹来大麻烦 老兄！
	It's shit like this that'll bring this situation to a head, man 
	我没逼你 好吗?你知道我一直很尊重你
	I ain't threatening you with nothing, all right? You know I respect you and all
	可是别让我难做人 好吗?
	but just don't put me in this position, all right?
	好的好的 你这样好好地说就没事
	All right  Fine  Fine  Ask me nice like that, no problem 
	把你的朋友搞定就好 我无所谓
	Just go handle your friend  Go ahead  I don't care 
	该死的 吉米 这咖啡真是人间美味
	Mmm  Goddamn, Jimmie  This is some serious gourmet shit 
	我们以为有速溶咖啡就很好了
	Me and Vincent would've been satisfied with some freeze-dried Taster's Choice, right?
	嘿 他居然为我们准备这么棒的 这是什么口味的?
	Heh! And he springs this serious gourmet shit on us.What flavor is this? 
	少来这套 朱尔斯
	Knock it off, Julie 
	怎么了?
	What?
	我不需要你告诉我我的咖啡有多好
	I don't need you to tell me how fucking good my coffee is 
	我自己买的我自己知道
	I'm the one who buys it  I know how good it is 
	要是邦妮去买 只会买一堆垃圾货
	When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit 
	我买讲究昂贵的咖啡 因为我不仅是喝 还要品尝
	I buy the gourmet expensive stuff because when I drink it, I want to taste it 
	但你知道现在我关心的是什么吗？不是我厨房里的咖啡
	But you know what's on my mind right now? It ain't the coffee in my kitchen 
	而是我车库里的死黑鬼
	It's the dead nigger in my garage 
	噢 吉米 别担心
	Oh, Jimmie, don't even worry about it 
	我什么都不关心 我只想问你一个问题
	I don't think about anything  I want to ask you a question 
	你开车来的时候看到我家门口写着“黑鬼停尸房”的指示牌了吗?
	When you came pulling in here did you notice a sign out in the front of my house that said Dead Nigger Storage?
	吉米 你知道我没有…
	Jimmie, you know I didn't see no shit   
	你看到我家门口写着“黑鬼停尸房”的指示牌了吗?
	Did you notice a sign in the front of my house that said Dead Nigger Storage?
	没 我没有
	No  I didn't 
	你知道为什么没看到吗? 为什么?
	You know why you didn't see that sign? Why?
	因为根本没写 因为给黑人收尸不关我鸟事
	Cause it ain't there cause storing dead niggers ain't my fucking business!
	吉米 我们不想把那狗杂种放…
	Jimmie, we're not going to store the motherfucker 
	难道你们不了解吗老兄?要是邦妮回到家
	Don't you fucking realize, man, that if Bonnie comes home
	看到房子里的尸体 就会跟我离婚
	and finds a body in her house, I'm going to get divorced?
	不用离婚顾问 不必试验分居 就能直接离婚 懂吗?
	No marriage counselor, no trial separation  I'm going to get fucking divorced, OK?
	我他妈的不想离婚!
	And I don't want to get fucking divorced 
	老兄 你知道的 我想帮你 但我不想失去我老婆 明白吗？
	Now, man, you know, fuck, I want to help you but I don't want to lose my wife doing it, all right?
	吉米 她不会离开你的
	Jimmie, she ain't going to leave you 
	别他妈叫我吉米 朱尔斯 懂吗？别他妈叫得这么亲密
	Don't fucking Jimmie me, Jules! OK? Don't fucking Jimmie me 
	不管你说什么 我都不会忘记我爱着我的妻子
	There's nothing you're gonna say that's gonna make me forget that I love my wife, is there?
	现在 离他下班回家还有一个半小时
	Look, you know she comes home from work in about an hour and a half 
	她在医院上夜班 你需要打电话吗?
	Graveyard shift at the hospital  You got to make some phone calls?
	你能通知什么人吗?赶快去做 在她回家之前把那尸体弄走
	You got to call some people? Well, then do it, and get the fuck out of my house before she gets here 
	我们人手很多 没问题 我们不会害你的
	That's Kool and the Gang  We don't want to fuck your shit up 
	我只想叫我的人来 替我们解围
	I want to call my people, get them to bring us in 
	你已经他妈的把我害惨了！
	You're fucking my shit up right now!
	要是邦妮回来了 你们还会把我害得更惨！
	You'll fuck my shit up big time if Bonnie comes home 
	所以 请帮个忙好吗?电话在卧室里 我建议你快点去
	So just do me that favor, all right? The phone is in my bedroom  I suggest you get going 
	好吧 说说要是她回到家里 她会怎么做?
	Well, say she comes home  What do you think she'll do?
	噢 这不是废话吗!她会抓狂的 毫无疑问
	Oh, no fucking shit, she'll freak  That ain't no kind of answer 
	我是说 她会有点抓狂 还是很抓狂?
	I mean, you know, I don't  How much? A lot or a little?
	你得了现在邦妮的状况是多么紧急
	You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is 
	她忙了整晚回到家里
	I mean, if she comes home from a hard day's work
	发现一伙歹徒在厨房里为非作歹…
	and finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen doing a bunch of gangster shit
	她会有什么反应还用说吗？
	there ain't no telling what she's liable to do 
	嗯 我了解 朱尔斯 我只是在设想各种可能性
	Yeah, I've grasped that, Jules  All I'm doing is contemplating the ifs 
	我不想听什么狗屁可能性
	I don't want to hear about no motherfucking ifs  
	你要听到的是你说：你不会有麻烦的朱尔斯 我会搞定
	All I want to hear from your ass is You ain't got no problem Jules  I'm on the motherfucker 
	回去把那黑鬼弄出来 然后等救兵来 很快就到
	Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which will be coming directly 
	你不会有麻烦的朱尔斯 我会搞定
	You ain't got no problem, Jules  I'm on the motherfucker 
	回去把那黑鬼弄出来 然后等“头狼”来 很快就到
	Go back in there and chill them niggers out and wait for The Wolf, who should be coming directly 
	你会派“头狼”来?
	You're sending The Wolf?
	怎么 感觉好些了 混蛋
	Oh, you feel better, motherfucker?
	黑鬼 你早该这么说！
	Shit, negro, that's all you had to say 
	她是那种歇斯底里的人吗? 她几点回家?
	Is she the hysterical type? When is she due?
	再念一次人员名单
	Give me the principals' names again 
	朱尔斯（黑人） 嗯
	Jules  Mm-hmm
	文森特（白人）
	Vincent
	吉米  邦妮  好的
	Jimmie  Bonnie  Mm-hmm 
	三十分钟车程   我十分钟就到
	It's thirty minutes away  I'll be there in ten 
	你是吉米吗? 这是你家?
	You're Jimmie, right? This is your house?
	当然
	Sure is 
	我是温斯顿·沃夫 来解决问题
	I'm Winston Wolf  I solve problems 
	太好了 我们刚好碰到麻烦
	Good  We got one 
	我听说了 我能进来吗?
	So I heard  May I come in?
	请进
	Yeah, please do 
	你一定是朱斯 所以你是文森特
	You must be Jules which would make you Vincent 
	让我们进入正题吧先生们
	Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen
	如果我得到的信息无误 时间非常紧 对吗吉米?
	If I was informed correctly the clock is ticking, is that right, Jimmie?
	非常正确
	100%
	尊夫人邦妮九点半到家对吗?
	Your wife Bonnie comes home at 9:30 in the a m , is that correct?
	对
	Uh-huh 
	我们有理由相信她回来看到这些 应该不会欣赏吧？
	I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here she wouldn't appreciate it none too much?
	她不会欣赏的
	She wouldn't at that 
	我们只有40分钟时间把尸体搬走
	That gives us forty minutes to get the fuck out of Dodge   
	照我说的做 时间充足
	which, if you do what I say when I say it, should be plenty 
	现在 车上有具无头尸体 带我去看看
	Now, you got a corpse in a car minus a head in a garage  Take me to it 
	吉米?
	Jimmie?
	我想我闻到了咖啡香 能给我倒一杯吗?
	I thought I smelled some coffee back there  Would you make me a cup?
	没问题
	Yeah, sure 
	你要加什么?
	Oh, how do you take it?
	多点奶 多点糖
	Lots of cream, lots of sugar 
	这辆车的性能有什么要交代的？
	About the car is there anything I need to know?
	看外表就知道这车很不俗
	Aside from how it looks, the car is cool 
	确定吗? 别开出去发现没刹车灯
	Positive? Don't get me out there on the road I find out the brake lights don't work 
	老兄 据我所知 这玩意状况绝佳
	Man, far as I know, the motherfucker's tiptop 
	很好 我们先回厨房
	Good enough  Let's go back to the kitchen 
	你的咖啡 沃夫先生
	Here you go, Mr  Wolf 
	谢谢你 吉米
	Thank you, Jimmie 
	首先 你们两个把尸体塞进行李厢
	OK, first thing you two, take the body, stick it in the trunk 
	吉米 这房子这么干净
	Now, Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house
	让我相信车库或者水槽下面一定有很多清洁剂之类的
	That would lead me to believe that in the garage or under the sink, you got a bunch of cleaners and shit?
	是的 沃夫先生 在洗脸槽底下
	Yeah, Mr  Wolf  Under the sink 
	很好 我要你们俩做的是拿着这些清洁用品去把车里打扫干净
	Good  What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car 
	动作要快、快、快
	I'm talking fast, fast, fast 
	得把后座上的脑浆和头骨碎片都清理出来
	Go in the back seat scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull 
	舀出来后 把车内擦干净 不必太仔细
	Get it out of there  Wipe down the upholstery  Now, it don't need to be spick-and-span 
	你们又不需要吃光它们 所以看上去过得去就行了
	You don't need to eat off it  Just give it a good once over 
	真正需要下功夫的是那些一团糟的地方
	What you need to take care of are the really messy parts 
	一滩滩的血迹一定要彻底吸干净
	The pools of blood that have collected you got to soak that shit up 
	吉米 我们到你的储物间去
	Now, Jimmie, we need to raid your linen closet
	我需要毯子 棉被 床单之类的东西
	I need blankets I need comforters I need quilts I need bedspreads
	越厚越黑越好 白的不行
	The thicker the better, the darker the better No whites  Can't use 'em 
	我们得掩饰车子内部
	We need to camouflage the interior of the car 
	前座、后座还有地板都铺上被子和毯子
	We're going to line the front seat and back seat and the floorboards with quilts and blankets 
	要是被警察拦下仔细检查的话恐怕会穿帮
	So if a cop stops us and sticks his big snout in the car the subterfuge won't last
	可是乍看之下这车都很正常
	but at a glance, the car will appear to be normal 
	吉米 你带路 开工了
	Jimmie, lead the way  Boys, get to work 
	说声“请”会更好
	Please would be nice 
	你说什么?
	Come again?
	我说：说声"请"会更好
	I said a please would be nice 
	我直说吧混球 我来这里不是为了说“请”
	Get it straight, buster  I'm not here to say please 
	我是来这是告诉你们该怎么做
	I'm here to tell you what to do 
	如果你还有自救的本能 你他妈最好快动手去干
	And if self-preservation is an instinct you possess you better fucking do it and do it quick

	叫我温士顿

	看见了吗小姐? 尊敬长者才有品格
	You see that, young lady? Respect  Respect for one's elders shows character 
	我很有品格
	I have character 
	你有性格不代表你有品格
	Because you are a character doesn't mean that you have character 
	一起搭车吧?
	Want to share a cab?
	我饿了 要一起吃早餐吗?
	I could go for some breakfast  Feel like having breakfast with me?
	好啊
	Cool 
	我以为他是欧洲人
	I don't know why, I thought he'd be European
	（“英国鲍勃”是经典西部片《不可饶恕》里的角色）
	Yo, man, he's about as European as English Bob 
	我知道……不过
	I know that now, but   
	他是不是很酷?
	Was he cool or what?
	他妈的酷呆了 一切都在掌控之中
	Totally fucking cool, in control 
	甚至你惹他的时候他都没真的生气 我非常惊讶
	Didn't even really get pissed when you were fucking with him  I was amazed 
	来点培根吧
	Want some bacon?
	我不吃猪肉
	No, man  I don't eat pork 
	你是犹太人吗?
	Are you Jewish?
	不是  我只是不喜欢猪
	Naw, I ain't Jewish  I just don't dig on swine, that's all 
	为什么?
	Why not?
	猪是龌龊的动物  我不吃龌龊的动物
	Pigs are filthy animals  I don't eat filthy animals 
	可是培根和猪排都很好吃
	Yeah, but bacon tastes good  Pork chops taste good 
	阴沟里的老鼠可能和南瓜饼一样香 但我永远不会知道
	Hey, a sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie but I'd never know
	因为我也不会吃那肮脏的烂东西
	cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers
	猪在大粪里吃喝睡觉 是龌龊的动物
	Pigs sleep and root in shit  That's a filthy animal 
	别想让我吃那些连自己的粪便都不在乎的东西
	I ain't eating nothing that ain't got sense enough to disregard its own feces 
	那狗呢? 狗吃自己的屎
	How about a dog? A dog eats his own feces 
	我也不吃狗肉
	I don't eat dog, either 
	可是你觉得狗龌龊吗?
	But do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?
	我还不至于把狗当作污秽的动物 不过狗确实很脏
	I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy but they're definitely dirty 
	但狗具有人性 这就够了
	But a dog's got personality  Personality goes a long way 
	照你这么说 如果猪稍有人性 它就不龌龊了是吗？
	Ah, so by that rationale if a pig had a better personality he would cease to be a filthy animal Is that true?
	那我们说的一定是一头万人迷猪
	We'd have to be talking about one charming motherfucking pig 
	（阿诺德是电影《绿色田野》里的粉红小猪）
	He'd have to be ten times more charming than Arnold on Green Acres, you know what I'm saying?
	噢 老兄 妙极了
	Oh, man, that's good 
	笑死人了  你开始放松心情了
	That's good, man  You're starting to lighten up 
	刚才你绷着脸好沉闷
	You been sitting there all serious and shit 
	我只是在想事情
	Man, I've just been sitting here thinking 
	想什么?
	About what?
	我们目睹的神迹
	About the miracle we witnessed 
	神迹是你目睹的  我只是看见恐怖的巧合
	The miracle you witnessed  I witnessed a freak occurrence 
	神迹是什么? 文森特?
	What is a miracle, Vincent?
	神做的事
	An act of God 
	神做的事是什么?
	And what's an act of God?
	神把不可能的事变成可能
	God makes the impossible possible 
	不过早上的事不能算
	But this morning I don't think qualifies 
	你不明白吗？这都不重要 你思考的方法都是错的
	Don't you see? That shit don't matter  You're judging this shit the wrong way 
	神可以挡住子弹也可以把可口可乐变成百事
	I mean, it could be God stopped the bullets or he changed Coke to Pepsi，
	他让我开窍了
	he found my fucking car keys
	不能仅用世俗的眼光去看这事
	You don't judge shit like this based on merit 
	这件事是不是神迹 并不重要
	Now, whether or not what we experienced was an According to Hoyle miracle is insignificant
	有意义的是我感觉到了神的存在 神的干预
	but what is significant is I felt the touch of God  God got involved 
	但是为什么?
	But why?
	我就是不知道为什么才操蛋 但是我不能回去睡大觉
	Well, that's what's fucking with me  I don't know why, but I can't go back to sleep 
	你不是真的想放弃吧?
	You're really thinking about quitting?
	这种生活? 对呀
	The life? Yeah 
	非常肯定
	Most definitely 
	那你打算做什么?
	What you going to do, then?
	我就是在想这个
	Well, that's what I've been sitting here contemplating 
	首先 我得先把皮箱送回去给马瑟勒斯
	First, I'm going to deliver this case to Marsellus 
	然后 基本上 就是行走江湖
	Then, basically, I'm just going to walk the earth 
	你什么意思 行走江湖?
	What you mean,walk the earth?
	像凯恩在电影《功夫》里一样
	You know, like Caine in Kung Fu
	从一个地方到另一个地方 到处交友和历险
	Walk from place to place,meet people,get in adventures meet people,get in adventures 
	你打算云走多久?
	 And how long do you intend to walk the earth?
	直到神指示我停下
	Till God puts me where he wants me to be 
	要是他没指示呢?
	And what if he don't do that?
	那我就永远走下去
	If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever 
	所以你打算当个乞丐?
	So you decided to be a bum?
	我打算当我自己文森特 就这么简单
	I'll just be Jules, Vincent    no more, no less 
	不 朱尔斯 你打算当个乞丐！
	No, Jules  You decided to be a bum 
	像外面那些狗屎般一样
	Just like all those pieces of shit out there
	乞讨零钱 睡在垃圾袋 吃别人扔的东西
	who beg for change who sleep in garbage bins, eat what I throw away 
	他们有个名字朱尔斯 叫做：叫花子
	They got a name for that, Jules  It's called a bum 
	没工作、没住所、没有钱
	And without a job, a residence, or legal tender that's what you're going to be
	老兄 你将会变成他妈的叫花子
	man  You're going to be a fucking bum
	朋友 这就是我们看法的不同
	Look, my friend, this is just where you and I differ 
	小弟！咖啡！
	Garcon! Coffee!
	我承认早上的事的确很罕见 
	What happened this morning, man, I agree it was peculiar 
	但并不像水掺在酒里难以分辨
	Garcon means boy  But water into wine  I   
	不管什么样的都能分辨 文森特
	All shapes and sizes, Vincent 
	别他妈这么和我说话老兄！
	Don't fucking talk to me that way, man 
	如果我的答案吓到你了文森特 就不要再问那些让你害怕的问题
	If my answers frighten you, Vincent then you should cease asking scary questions 
	我要去撇大条
	I'm going to take a shit 
	你什么时候决定的?刚才吃松饼的时候？
	When did you make this decision? When you were sitting there eating that muffin?
	对啊我边喝咖啡 边吃松饼 边回想刚才的一幕
	Well, yeah  I was sitting here eating my muffin and drinking my coffee and replaying the incident in my head
	就有了酒鬼所谓的"片刻清醒"
	when I had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity

	But I don't want that,
	你也不想这样
	and you don't want that
	这位林戈也肯定不想这样
	and Ringo here definitely doesn't want that 
	所以让我们看看能做些什么
	So let's see what we can do
	情况是这样的
	Now,here's the situation 
	通常你们两个会像炸鸡一样被我宰掉
	Normally both your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken
	不过恰好我正想改过自新
	but you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period
	我不想杀你  我想帮你
	and I don't want to kill you  I want to help you 
	但这皮箱不能给你 它不是我的
	But I can't give you this case, 'cause it don't belong to me
	况且为这皮箱  你们这些蠢蛋让我受了太多罪
	Besides, I been through too much shit over this case to just hand it over to your dumb ass 
	文森特  冷静点
	Vincent! Be cool!
	尤兰达 没事的  宝贝  没事
	Yolanda, it's cool, baby! It's cool!
	继续谈  把枪指住我  对了
	We still just talking! Come on, point the gun at me! Point the gun at me! There you go 
	文森特  停手 别做傻事       跟她说没事
	Now, Vincent, you just hang back and don't do a goddamn thing  Tell her we're still cool 
	没事的  小兔兔
	We're still cool, Honey Bunny 
	你还好吧宝贝儿?
	How we doing, baby?
	我想尿尿  我想回家
	L    I gotta go pee  I want to go home 
	坚持住宝贝儿 你做得很好 我很骄傲
	Just hang in there, baby  You're doin' great  I'm proud of you 
	林戈也为你骄傲  就快没事了
	And Ringo's proud of you  It's almost over 
	跟她说你很骄傲
	Tell her you're proud of her 
	我很骄傲  小兔兔
	I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny 
	我爱你
	I love you
	我也爱你  小兔兔
	I love you, too, Honey Bunny 
	现在把我的钱包找出来
	I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet 
	哪一个?
	Which one is it?
	上面写"混帐东西"那个
	It's the one that says Bad Motherfucker 
	那就是我的混帐东西
	That's my Bad Motherfucker 
	打开它  把钱拿出来
	Open it up  Take out the money 
	数一数
	Count it 
	有多少?
	How much is there?
	一千五
	About $1,500 
	拿去  全都给你
	OK, put it in your pocket  It's yours 
	加上其他人的钱  收获算丰富了
	With the rest of those wallets and the register that makes this a pretty successful little score
	朱尔斯  你拿一千五给他  按我原则我就毙了他
	Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod $ 1,500 and I'll shoot him on general principle 
	优兰达  他不会的  文森特 闭上嘴！
	No, Yolanda, Yolanda! He ain't gonna do a goddamn motherfuckin' thing  Vince, shut the fuck up!
	别激动 尤兰达 继续指着我 宝贝
	Come on, Yolanda, stay with me, baby  Now, I ain't givin' it to him, Vincent 
	我不是给他  我是向他买东西
	I'm buyin' somethin' for my money  
	想知道我买什么吗?
	Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?
	什么?
	What?
	你的命 我给你钱 就不用杀你
	Your life  I'm givin' you that money so I don't have to kill your ass 
	你读过圣经吗?
	You read the Bible, Ringo?
	不常读
	Not regularly, no 
	有段经文  我熟记在心
	Well, there's this passage I got memorized 
	《以西结书》二十五章十七节
	Ezekiel 25:17 
	正直之人的道路
	The path of the righteous man
	被小人的自私贪婪和恶人的暴虐专政所笼罩
	is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
	以仁慈善良之名引领弱小穿越黑暗之谷的“牧羊人”
	Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will 
	必将得到神的护佑
	shepherds the weak through the Valley of Darkness
	因为他守护兄弟同胞、拯救迷途羔羊
	for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children 
	我将对那些毒害和屠杀我同胞的人
	And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger 
	充满巨大的仇恨和爆裂的怒火
	those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers 
	当我复仇之焰吞噬你的那刻 你会知道我的名字 叫做上帝
	And you will know I am the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon you 
	这段话我说了很多年 听过的人都会死
	Now, I been sayin' that shit for years  And if you heard it, that meant your ass 
	我从未仔细想过其中的涵意
	I never gave much thought to what it meant
	只觉得是干掉某个混蛋前冷血的说辞
	I just thought it was some cold-blooded shit to say to a motherfucker before I popped a cap in his ass
	但今早发生了一件事  让我开始反省
	But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice 
	之前我认为你是恶人 我是正直的人
	See, now I'm thinkin' maybe it means you're the evil man and I'm the righteous man 
	我的9毫米口径手枪像牧羊人般保护我穿越黑暗之谷
	and Mr  Nine-millimeter here he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the Valley of Darkness 
	或者你是正直之人 我是“牧羊人”
	Or it could mean you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd 
	而邪恶自私的是这个世界
	and it's the world that's evil and selfish 
	我很喜欢这个解释 但是也不对
	Now, I'd like that  But that shit ain't the truth 
	事实是你是弱者  而我是那暴虐的恶魔
	The truth is you're the weak and I am the tyranny of evil men 
	但我很努力…林戈
	But I'm tryin', Ringo
	我真的非常努力想成为慈悲的“牧羊人”
	I'm tryin' real hard to be the shepherd
	走吧
	Go on 
	我们最好赶快走人
	I think we should be leaving now 
	真是个好主意
	Yeah, that's probably a good idea

	- Sure. Yes. - OK, we'll be here.
	再见\N
	Good-bye.
	我要去见盖文·贝尔森了\N
	Uh, I have a meeting with Gavin Belson.
	他喜欢魔笛手\N
	He likes Pied Piper.
	我拥有魔笛手百分之十的股份\N
	I own 10 percent of Pied Piper.
	你说它是个糟糕的想法\N
	You said it was a shitty idea.
	它曾经是个糟糕的想法\N
	It was a shitty idea.
	但我不确定它现在算什么\N
	I'm not sure what it is now.
	-什么时候开会  -现在\N
	- What time's the meeting? - Right now.
	我得去找件好点的衬衫\N
	I'm gonna need a better shirt.
	天呐\N
	Holy shit.
	我还在这儿等什么呢  再见\N
	What the fuck am I waiting for? See ya.
	就像盖文经常说的那样\N
	Well, it's like Gavin always says,
	"改变需要代价"\N
	"It takes change to make change."
	好像到处都写满了这句话\N
	Yeah, I think I've seen that written around.
	盖文大概要迟到三十分钟\N
	Gavin is running 30 minutes late
	但他非常期待见到你  理查德\N
	but you should know he is very excited to see you, Richard.
	他和他的精神导师在一起呢\N
	He's with his spiritual advisor.
	他不会用那么久的\N
	He shouldn't be that much longer.
	我是公司的副总裁\N
	I'm a VP here
	但我每月能见到他的时间也就十分钟左右\N
	and I only get to see him about ten minutes a month.
	但这十分钟就已让人受益无穷\N
	But that 10 minutes is just incredible.
	我听说理查德·亨德里克斯来了\N
	I heard Richard Hendricks was here.
	你以前见过盖文吗\N
	Have you ever met Gavin before?
	-没有  -没有吗\N
	- No. - No?
	我刚告诉过他  真是超凡体验\N
	Oh, I told him, it's amazing.
	那种感觉真是无以言表\N
	That hardly begins to describe it.
	我发现了一个奇怪的现象\N
	It's weird.
	这些程序员  他们总是五人同行\N
	They always travel in groups of five.
	其中总有一个高高瘦瘦的白人\N
	These programmers, there's always a tall skinny white guy,
	一个瘦瘦小小的亚洲人\N
	short skinny Asian guy,
	一个扎马尾的胖子\N
	fat guy with a ponytail,
	一个胡子剃成奇怪形状的人\N
	some guy with crazy facial hair
	和一个东印度人\N
	and then an East Indian guy.
	就好像他们为了得到这种分组\N
	It's like they trade guys
	而特意换过人一样\N
	until they all have the right group.
	看来你已经深谙人性之道\N
	You clearly have a great understanding of humanity.
	然后盖文说  我不是在羞辱你\N
	And Gavin said: I'm not humiliating you,
	我是在点拨你\N
	I'm elevating you.
	盖文\N
	Ah, Gavin.
	我是理查德\N
	This is Richard.
	是彼得·格里高利打来的\N
	It's Peter Gregory.
	没有\N
	Ah, no.
	快点  大头\N
	Come on, Big Head.
	我来了  慢点...\N
	Yeah, I'm coming. Slow...
	走那么快干嘛\N
	Why are you going that fast?
	因为我们要去见盖文·贝尔森  快走\N
	Cause we've got a meeting with Gavin Belson. Pick up the pace.
	-事实上我们没有  -快点\N
	- We honestly don't. - Come on.
	事实上我现在正在\N
	I'm actually outside of
	盖文·贝尔森办公室外  格里高利先生\N
	Gavin Belson's office right now, Mr. Gregory.
	他来了  我能过会儿再...\N
	Uh, here he comes, so can I call you back in...
	这位就是理查德·亨德里克斯吧\N
	So, Richard Hendricks is here!
	你在这儿呢  理查德\N
	There you are, Richard.
	非常抱歉让你等了这么久\N
	So sorry these gentleman have kept you waiting.
	-没关系  -事情是这样的\N
	- That's fine. - So here's the thing.
	我简直爱死你做的东西了\N
	I love what you did.
	-真的吗  -给他讲讲  贾里德\N
	- Really? - Fill him in, Jared.
	如你所知  互利大概是\N
	Now, as you know, Hooli is seen as possibly
	世界上最先进的公司\N
	the most progressive company in the world.
	一半归功于盖文对社会公平的恪守\N
	Part of that is Gavin's commitment to social justice,
	但另一半归功于他个人\N
	but part of it is his personal commitment
	对互利员工的不懈栽培\N
	to the people that work at Hooli.
	怀着同样的心情\N
	In that spirit Gavin is
	盖文打算付给你实质的奖金\N
	prepared to give you a very substantial raise...
	并提拔你到相应的职位\N
	and a promotion to go with it.
	我有百分之十的股份呢\N
	I own 10 percent.
	他是住在我家时创建的魔笛手\N
	He created it while living in my incubator.
	我是埃利希·巴赫曼  这位是大头\N
	Erlich Bachman. This is Big Head.
	我不知道你们在说些什么\N
	I don't know what any of that means,
	不过我出六十万美元买你的网站\N
	but I'll give you six hundred thousand dollars for it.
	我们有平台和资源来接手你的网站\N
	We have the reach and the resources to take what you have done
	并让它红遍全球\N
	and push it to the global level.
	你的报价非常慷慨\N
	That is a generous offer.
	不好意思  你好\N
	Shit, sorry. Hello.
	真的吗  开玩笑吧\N
	Really? No shit, that's...
	给你  是彼得·格里高利打来的\N
	Uh, yeah, yeah. No here. It's Peter Gregory.
	不知道他是怎么弄到我的号码的\N
	Not sure how he got my number?
	你好  我是理查德\N
	Uh, this is Richard.
	我可以现在就给你三百万美元\N
	I'll give you three million dollars for it right now!
	盖文·贝尔森刚刚\N
	Ah, Gavin Belson just offered
	出价三百万美元买我的魔笛手\N
	me three million dollars for Pied Piper.
	我打算出价三十万美元\N
	I'm prepared to give you three hundred thousand dollars.
	彼得·格里高利出价三...\N
	Peter Gregory just offered me 300, um...
	你说的是三十万美元吗\N
	Did you say thousand dollars?
	三十万美元买你公司百分之十的股份\N
	For ten percent of your company.
	好吧  四百万\N
	OK, four million.
	二十万\N
	200 thousand.
	-买百分之五  -什么\N
	- For five percent. - Huh?
	你刚刚降价了\N
	You just went down.
	不  你公司的估价仍为四百万美元\N
	No, you're still valued at four million dollars.
	但是这个潜在价值\N
	But you own ninety-five
	为数十亿美金的公司95%的股份都归你\N
	percent of a potential billion-dollar company.
	不仅如此  我还将帮你打造这个公司\N
	And not just that, I will help you build this company.
	我会帮你拓展人脉\N
	I will introduce you to the people you need to know
	为你提供咨询\N
	and provide the counsel that you need.
	我只会分走很小一部分  公司还是你的\N
	I will take a small piece, but the company will belong to you.
	而不是盖文·贝尔森\N
	not Gavin Belson.
	你必须明天之前给我答复\N
	You have until tomorrow to decide.
	好吧\N
	Ah, OK.
	-你知道...  -放聪明点  理查德\N
	- Um, you know... - Pull your head out of your ass, Richard.
	我开的价可是四百万美元\N
	I'm offering you four million dollars right now.
	我...\N
	I'm....
	那不是笔小数目\N
	That is a lot of money.
	实际上我得...\N
	You know, I actually have to...
	我得去下洗手间\N
	I've got to go to the bathroom.
	去尿尿\N
	I've got to pee.
	憋死了  膀胱要炸了\N
	It's desperate. I'm bursting.
	我马上就回来  但现在\N
	I'll be right back, but right now...
	好吧  一千万\N
	OK, 10 million.
	不行  也许吧\N
	No. Maybe.
	我并没想对你无力\N
	I didn't mean to snap at you.
	我们等下再谈\N
	I'll talk... in a bit.
	很快回来\N
	Won't be long.
	简单介绍下我自己\N
	Little more about me.
	我是亚威亚托的创始人\N
	I am the founder of Aviato.
	而且我拥有很小一部分'基达'的股份\N
	and I own a very small percentage of Grindr.
	这是个男男交友网站\N
	It's a men to men dating site
	通过它你可以找到方圆十六公里内\N
	where you can find other men within 10 miles of you,
	愿意与你在公厕里做爱的男人\N
	interested in having sexual intercourse in a public restroom.
	在同性恋的圈子里  有时会要匿名...\N
	In the homosexual community there's sometimes anonymous...
	我知道'基达'是什么\N
	I know what Grindr is.
	我也有基友\N
	I have gay friends.
	你会没事的\N
	So you will survive.
	只是很常见的恐慌发作\N
	It's just a garden-variety panic attack.
	欢迎来到硅谷\N
	Welcome to Silicon Valley.
	像你这种人我们见多了\N
	We see people like you all the time.
	-真的吗  -当然\N
	- Really? - Yes.
	我得在明天之前做决定\N
	It's just I have to make this decision by tomorrow.
	是啊  这里曾经有个病人\N
	Yeah. You know, a while back, we had a guy in here,
	和你的状况几乎一样\N
	in almost the exact same situation,
	跟别人干或是自己干\N
	"Take the money or keep the company."
	发生了什么\N
	What happened?
	几个月后\N
	Well, a couple months later
	他被送入急诊室  因为试图开枪自杀\N
	he was brought into the ER with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
	看来他真的很懊悔没要那笔钱\N
	I guess he really regretted not taking that money.
	他因为没拿钱就崩了自己一枪\N
	He shot himself because he turned down the money?
	是啊\N
	Yeah.
	不对  他拿了钱\N
	Or no, he took the money.
	不对\N
	Or no.
	他没拿  我也...\N
	No, he did not. I don't... You know what?
	其实我也忘了  不管他选了什么\N
	I don't remember. But whatever it was,
	他都悔不当初  然后崩了自己一枪\N
	he regretted it so much that he ended up shooting himself.
	-结果现在瞎了  -他瞎了\N
	- And now he's blind. - He's blind?
	是啊  顺便说一句\N
	Yeah, just FYI,
	如果你想开枪自杀的话\N
	if you're ever gonna shoot yourself,
	不要朝着太阳穴开枪\N
	don't hold the gun up to your temple, OK?
	那样你的两根视神经\N
	Because that just basically just took out
	就都完蛋了  然后\N
	both of his optic nerves and then, you know,
	还要再赔上这半边脸\N
	half of his face.
	他老婆后来不要他了  因为  你知道\N
	And then his wife left him, because, you know.
	-吓死人了  -是啊\N
	- Yikes. - Right.
	他可能确实是个编程天才\N
	He may have been a genius programmer
	但人体解剖他就不行了\N
	but not so much in human anatomy.
	在做决策上也不怎么明智\N
	Or decision making, for that matter.
	现在他就得带着张烂脸\N
	Now he's got to live with all that
	还有为钱做的糟糕决定度过一生\N
	and whatever terrible decision he made about the money.
	如果我又要恐慌发作了该怎么办\N
	Uh. And what do I do if I feel another panic attack coming on.
	你有没有兴趣买一个装置\N
	Would you be interested in a device
	与你的智能手机相连\N
	that links up to your smartphone
	能时刻监控你的体征\N
	and it keeps track of your vitals
	它甚至能赶在发生之前探测到\N
	and it tells you, even before it's happening,
	你是要恐慌发作  还是心脏病发作\N
	whether you're having a panic attack or an actual heart attack?
	听起来不错\N
	Yeah, that sounds great.
	你会买的  对吧\N
	You would, right?
	很好  这是个好消息\N
	OK, that's great news.
	因为现在这个装置还处于试验阶段\N
	Because it's still in prototype phase right now,
	我和我的创业伙伴在找投资者\N
	but my start-up partners and I are looking for investors.
	比如说现在\N
	Like today.
	所以如果你接受了那一千万美元\N
	So will you please let me know...
	我把我的电话给你\N
	I'm going to give you my number.
	请你一定要通知我\N
	If you do end up taking that 10 million dollars
	因为我们可以创建一个更美好的未来\N
	because we could really make the world a better place.
	老天\N
	Whoa! Oh, jeez!
	理查德\N
	Richard.
	我叫莫妮卡  我为彼得·格里高利工作\N
	Hi, Monica. I work with Peter Gregory.
	我们在TED论坛场外见过\N
	We met outside the TED...
	对  我记得你\N
	Yeah, I remember you.
	怎么  你怎么知道我在这\N
	What... How'd you know I was here?
	彼得·格里高利正在投资一家公司\N
	Peter Gregory is investing in a company
	能利用手机的定位系统来追踪人\N
	that uses GPS in phones to track people.
	好恐怖\N
	That's creepy.
	你根本不知道有多恐怖\N
	You don't know the half of it.
	国会也不知道\N
	And neither does Congress.
	你还好吧\N
	Are you OK?
	听着  我不想浪费你的时间\N
	Look, I don't want to waste your time.
	我准备接受盖文·贝尔森的钱了\N
	I think I gotta take the money from Gavin Belson.
	这样当我的眼球被自己打爆时\N
	At least this way when I blow my eyeballs out
	还能给我的家人留点钱\N
	I'll have some money left for my family.
	老天\N
	Jesus.
	抱歉  那个医生可真不怎么样\N
	Sorry. That is a terrible doctor in there.
	理查德  在你那个简陋的用户界面之下\N
	Richard, buried in that clunky UI of yours
	是一个甩了我们几条街的压缩算法\N
	is a compression algorithm that blew our engineering team away.
	你觉得互利准备用它来做什么\N
	And what do you think Hooli is going to do with it?
	不知道  这不关我的事\N
	I don't know. That's their business.
	这是你一手开发的\N
	This is your baby.
	你有没有意识到这么好的算法\N
	Do you even realize the impact that a compression
	会对世界产生多大的影响\N
	this good could have on the world?
	能瞬间下载文件到你的手机里\N
	Getting any file on your mobile phone in an instant.
	给自动驾驶车辆提供导航信息\N
	Navigation data for self-driving cars,
	移动设备上传输医学影像\N
	mobile medical imagery,
	这些数据都不会在传输时损失其质量\N
	all transmitting with no quality loss.
	这将颠覆一切\N
	This is game-changing.
	当这一切发生时  你不想成为其主宰者吗\N
	Don't you want to be in the driver's seat when that happens?
	你真的想把机会让给互利\N
	You really want to just turn it all over to Hooli
	彻底离开这个舞台吗\N
	and walk away?
	你说这么多并没有缓解我的压力\N
	Well, you are not making this easier for me.
	我也没这个打算\N
	I'm not trying to.
	我的意思是你其实让事情变得更糟了\N
	I mean you're actually making it worse.
	我现在手麻了  嘴里一股金属味\N
	My hands are tingling. I have this metal taste in my mouth.
	我不能再进去了  我要回家了\N
	Actually, I can't go back in there, so I'm going to go home.
	-让我送你一程  -很高兴再见到你\N
	- Let me give you a ride home. - Good to see you again.
	好吧  谢谢\N
	Uh, OK. Thanks.
	老兄  你去哪了\N
	Dude, where have you been?
	怎么不接电话\N
	Why won't you answer your phone?
	老兄  这已经超出天使名单的范围了\N
	Man, this has grown way beyond AngelList.
	安德鲁森  上升和其他一堆\N
	Andreesen, Elevation and like a bunch of
	种子基金都虎视眈眈\N
	other seed funds are piling onto this thing.
	我是说  他们一直在给埃利希打电话\N
	I mean, they've been calling Erlich.
	他现在已经失控了\N
	He's out of control.
	如果我们拿彼得·格里高利的二十万\N
	What if we took Peter Gregory's 200K
	来成立我们自己的公司怎么样\N
	and built our own company?
	不好意思  你刚刚说我们\N
	I'm sorry. You said we.
	这到底指的是谁\N
	Who's that in reference to exactly?
	你  我  迪尼希  大头  我们\N
	You, me, Dinesh, Big Head, us.
	我是说  现在魔笛手只是做音频\N
	I mean, right now Pied Piper just does audio,
	但我正在想方法压缩图片  视频\N
	but I'm thinking of ways to compress images, video...
	我是说  也许彼得·格里高利是对的\N
	I mean, maybe Peter Gregory's right.
	也许这能做得很大\N
	Maybe this could be huge.
	听着  伙计们  几千年来\N
	Look, guys, for thousands of years
	我们这种人一直都被别人踩在脚下\N
	guys like us have gotten the shit kicked out of us.
	但现在  第一次  我们生活在一个\N
	But now, for the first time, we are living in an era
	我们能主宰和构建帝国的时代\N
	where we can be in charge and build empires.
	我们能成为这个时代的维京海盗\N
	We could be the Vikings of our day.
	-维京海盗  -你感觉怎么样\N
	- Vikings? - How are you feeling?
	你看起来一团糟  老实说\N
	You look super fucked up, to be honest.
	谁他妈的又吃了我的藜麦面\N
	Who ate my fucking quinoa again?
	所以你真的打算去告诉埃利希\N
	So you're really about to go tell Erlich
	他拿不到他的一百万美元了\N
	that he's not going to get his one million dollars?
	千万找个我不在的时候告诉他\N
	Yeah, I don't want to be there when you do that.
	找个我在的时候\N
	I would like to be there when you do that.
	别  就待在这  拜托\N
	No, just stay here, please.
	我一直在考虑\N
	Um, so, I've been thinking about
	彼得·格里高利  盖文·贝尔森的事\N
	this whole Peter Gregory, Gavin Belson thing.
	我想我要选择彼得·格里高利\N
	And, um, I think I'm going to go with Peter Gregory.
	-我的意思是  -理查德\N
	- Uh, which I know means... - Richard.
	我知道每当你看着我\N
	I know that you look at me,
	你看到的是一个对一切都了如指掌的人\N
	and see a guy who has it all figured out.
	很大程度上  你是对的  我说真的\N
	And for the most part, you're right, I do.
	当我卖掉亚威亚托的时候\N
	When I sold Aviato,
	它给了我房子  金钱  好看的衣服\N
	it gave me a house, money, fancy clothes,
	所有女人对我的尊重\N
	the universal respect of all the ladies.
	但我的心里一直有一个洞\N
	But there's always been a hole in my heart.
	不是字面上的洞  像你能\N
	Not a literal hole like you would find
	在有先天疾病的孩子身上找到的\N
	in some babies with congenital diseases,
	而是一个比喻的洞\N
	but a metaphorical hole.
	我觉得那个洞就是"如果"\N
	I guess that hole is the "What if".
	如果我没有卖会怎么样\N
	What if I didn't sell?
	我永远都不会知道\N
	I'll never know.
	所以我现在要和你说的就是\N
	And so I guess what I'm saying to you now is,
	你像我一样  理查德\N
	you're like me, Richard.
	你想创一番事业\N
	You want to build something
	并奋战到底\N
	and see it through.
	所以  让我们说清楚\N
	So, just to be clear.
	你不介意我拒绝一笔\N
	You're all right with me saying no to a deal
	能一下子给你一百万美元净利的生意\N
	that will net you a million dollars outright?
	不  理查德  我不是不介意\N
	No, Richard. I'm not all right with it.
	我是非常激动\N
	I'm excited about it.
	我们一起见证这艘火箭能飞多高  合伙人\N
	Let's see how high this rocket can fly, partner.
	好的\N
	OK. Great.
	太好了\N
	That's great.
	我指得不是合伙人\N
	Not partners, exactly.

	多少下  17\N
	What was that, 17?
	-相当不错  -伙计们\N
	- Pretty good. - Hey, guys...
	伙计们  我能简短地说几句话吗\N
	Guys, can I just kind of say something real quick?
	我知道这很蠢但是\N
	I know it's stupid but, um...
	我想说\N
	I just want to say, uh,
	我希望这家公司和互利\N
	I'd like for this company to be different than Hooli
	顾利拜还有其他的都不一样\N
	and Goolybib and all the rest, you know?
	我们不要让它变成有骑车开会\N
	Like, let's like not turn this into a corporate cult
	把强制性解雇\N
	with bike meetings and voluntary retreats
	说成是自愿辞职\N
	that are actually mandatory.
	还一直声称要创造更美好的世界的那种公司\N
	And claiming to make the world a better place all the time.
	让我们  让我们非同凡想\N
	Let's, uh, let's just think different.
	不要非同凡想  那是苹果的\N
	Don't think different. That's Apple.
	让我们就  想做就做吧\N
	Let's just... let's just do it.
	-那是耐克  老兄  -我知道是耐克\N
	- That's Nike, man. - I know that's Nike.
	我擦  我不知道\N
	Fuck it. I don't know.
	我们就  让它美梦成真\N
	Let's just make it... Let's just make it happen.
	好  同意\N
	Yeah, agreed.

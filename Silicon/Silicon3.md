	老兄  老兄  我要向你道歉\N
	Dude! Dude, hey. I owe you a big apology, man.
	我之前没认出来你  我看到了网上\N
	I had no idea who you were before and I read all this coverage
	关于你公司的报道  才反应过来\N
	about your company online, and I was like,
	是'魔笛手'\N
	"Hey, Pied Piper!
	我见过这位仁兄  他来过商店\N

	'微程序'  怎么样\N
	All right, what about Smaller,

	and this would be like a smaller version of the word "Smaller".
	-看起来像"体臭"的缩写  -好吧\N
	- It looks like "Smeller". - OK.
	那如果拼成\N
	What if we spell it...
	"S-M-L-R"呢\N
	..."S-M-L-R"?
	因为这是"微程序"这个词更缩小的版本\N

	So now I have to come up with a new name
	然后去找彼得·格里高利要一张新支票\N
	and take that to Peter Gregory and ask for a new check.
	然后他会撤资\N

	强悍到他所有的朋友都在告他\N
	that now all of his friends are suing him.

	你宁可什么都不做也不愿尝试做一些事\N
	you would rather do nothing than something?
	因为那个屋子里的那帮人\N
	Because all the guys in the other room
	尽管想出了一些类似于'小成器'的\N
	coming up with shitty names like,
	恶心名字  但他们至少做了些什么\N

	What about, "Dwarfism 2.0"?
	'小矮子1.0'在哪\N
	Where's "Dwarfism 1.0"?
	就在这世界中\N
	Just in the world.
	这是歧视\N
	That's prejudice.
	-太伤人了  -对不起\N
	- That's hurtful. - I'm sorry.
	小个子  快回来  你在吗\N
	Small, come back now, are you here?

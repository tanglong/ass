	但前七个星期里你整整老了四十岁\N
	but you have essentially aged 40 years in the last seven weeks.
	真的吗\N
	Wow. Really?
	我们这今早来了个瘾君子\N
	We had a meth addict in here this morning
	他的生理年龄都比你年轻  他都58岁了\N
	who was biologically younger than you are, and he's 58.
	是个'我的空间'的家伙\N
	MySpace guy.
	到底怎么回事\N
	So what is going on?
	都是因为那个配置云服务\N
	Uh... It's this cloud service configuration,
	我已经在这上面卡了一个多星期了\N
	I've been stuck on it for over a week.
	我是个好程序员\N
	I'm a good programmer.
	这是我唯一擅长的事\N
	I mean, it's the only thing I am good at.
	就去年  我扔飞盘结果敲碎了自己的牙\N
	I mean, last year, I threw a Frisbee and it chipped my tooth.
	你要看的可不止是牙医\N
	That's more of a dental issue.
	好吧  我\N
	Yup, OK, I...
	我要说的是  我17岁时\N
	The point is, I learned
	用一个周末就掌握了基于Rails平台的Ruby语言\N
	Ruby on Rails over a weekend when I was 17.
	我肯定能学会云计算  我必须学会\N
	I should be able to learn cloud, I have to.
	你想听听我作为你医生的专业意见吗\N
	Can I give you my professional opinion, as your doctor?
	你应该收下盖文·贝尔森那一千万美元\N
	You should have taken that ten million dollars from Gavin Belson,
	知道吗\N
	OK?
	但你会因后悔而自杀的\N
	But regrets will kill ya
	所以千万别太沮丧\N
	so try not to dwell on it.
	我之前就提醒过你的\N
	I tried to tell you.
	外援  我们才不要什么外援\N
	Outside help? No, we're not getting any outside help.
	还有一周就是'科技博客'创业展会\N
	It's a week until TechCrunch,
	理查德  不能再等下去了\N
	Richard. We can't wait any longer.
	理查德  你看看这块板\N
	Richard, look at the board.
	云架构就像是\N
	OK, cloud architecture is
	堵住了下水道的一大坨大便\N
	just a giant turd that is clogging up our pipes.
	我们得找水管工来疏通下\N
	We have to call in a plumber to fix it.
	我讨厌这个比喻  但埃利希说得没错\N
	OK, I hate that metaphor, but Erlich is right.
	吉尔弗约尔和我几天前\N
	Gilfoyle and I finished
	就把分配服务这块搞定了\N
	the distribution services days ago
	我们就一直干坐着等你\N
	and we're just sitting around waiting for you.
	我自己能解决\N
	I can solve it.
	理查德  你他妈绝对是编程好手\N
	Richard, you're a fucking rock star, OK?
	但你就是学不会云计算\N
	You just don't know cloud,
	就这么个微不足道的破领域\N
	this tiny, little, shitty area,
	现在已经变得举足轻重\N
	which is becoming super important,
	在很多方面都称得上是计算机业的未来\N
	and in many ways is the future of computing.
	我有点跑题了\N
	That sort of went south on me,
	但你明白我的意思\N
	but you understand what I'm saying.
	我已经跟彼得·格里高利\N
	I've already talked to
	谈过要引入一位顾问\N
	Peter Gregory about insourcing a consultant.
	我和一位程序员联系过\N
	I've made contact with a programmer
	他在云架构上的造诣\N
	whose cloud architecture
	可算得上是登峰造极  人称'雕刻者'\N
	is supposed to be insane. They call him The Carver.
	'雕刻者'  那个黑帽黑客\N
	The Carver? That Black Hat guy
	黑进了'美国银行'\N
	who apparently hacked into the Bank of America
	搞垮了他们整个系统  就那个'雕刻者'\N
	and took down their entire system, that The Carver?
	如果可以一定要拉他入伙\N
	We should get him if we can.
	好吧  我们可以跟他谈谈\N
	OK, we can talk to the guy,
	但他得让我信服才行\N
	but, I mean, he's really gonna have to sell me.
	半年前  这帮家伙赚了三千五百万\N
	Six months ago, these guys had 35 million
	拿到了新一轮融资\N
	and Series B Financing.
	而现在'雕刻者'正在对它进行分拆\N
	Now The Carver's here doing teardown.
	他把全部精力都投入到云计算了\N
	He's basically moving their carcass to the cloud.
	什么都不要碰  失败是会传染的\N
	Don't touch anything. Failure is contagious.
	应该就是他\N
	I think that's him.
	打扰下  雕刻者先生\N
	Excuse me, Mr. Carver?
	对  大家都称我为雕刻者\N
	Yeah, uh, people refer to me as The Carver,
	但没人当面这样叫我\N
	but no one actually calls me that,
	那就是个网名\N
	it's what people call a screen name.
	你们懂的\N
	You know.
	我叫凯文\N
	I'm Kevin.
	好吧  凯文  我们是'魔笛手'的\N
	OK, Kevin, um, we're from Pied Piper,
	之前跟你聊过\N
	we spoke earlier.
	对  你们这帮人搞砸了  对吧\N
	Yeah, so you guys are fucked, huh?
	不  我们才没搞砸\N
	No. No, we're not fucked.
	没错  我们简直失败透顶\N
	Yes, we are totally fucked.
	我们一星期后要做展示程序\N
	We have a live demo in one week
	结果云计算这块便秘了\N
	and our cloud is in the shitter.
	-正是如此  -等等  你是理查德\N
	- That's accurate. - Wait, are you Richard?
	对  是我\N
	Yes, I am.
	你的算法很不错  架构相当完美\N
	Yeah, your algorithm is solid. It's a really good schema.
	多谢夸奖\N
	OK, thanks.
	你比我想象中老  你多大  25\N
	I did think you'd be younger. What are you, 25?
	26\N
	Twenty-six.
	妈呀\N
	Yikes.
	我周一时要参加个模拟联合国会议[学术性活动]\N
	Uh, so I have a model U.N. thing on Monday,
	但我应该这个周末能把你们的活搞定\N
	but maybe I could burn through your gig over the weekend.
	你觉得你能在两天内把活都干完\N
	You think you can do our whole job in two days?
	我知道自己两天内能搞定\N
	I know I can do it in two days.

	奥利奥和阿德拉过活  做不完我不睡觉\N
	Oreos and Adderall and I don't sleep until I'm done.
	好吧\N
	Ok.
	但你们知道吗  '基塔翁克'这周末\N
	But you know what? I also have an offer to do some migration
	请我去做跨平台移植\N
	at Gittawonk this weekend.
	还挺让人兴奋的\N
	It's... it's kind of chill,
	而且说实话  他们的技术更强一些\N
	and frankly, their tech's a little stronger.
	什么  你说什么\N
	Whoa. What? What?
	你觉得'基塔翁克'的技术比我们强\N
	You think Gittawonk's tech is stronger than ours?
	真是抱歉  但我可没在PandoDaily[科技网站]上看过\N
	I'm sorry, I don't remember reading in PandoDaily
	盖文·贝尔森和彼得·格里高利\N
	that Gavin Belson and Peter Gregory
	争抢'基塔翁克'的报道\N
	were fighting over Gittawonk.
	从没有人为购买'基塔翁克'开价一千万\N
	No one offered ten million dollars to acquire Gittawonk.
	对  我同意理查德说的\N
	Yeah, I agree with Richard,
	你应该来为我们工作\N
	you should come work for us.
	-什么  -你想要什么  给你咬吗\N
	- What... - What's it gonna take, a blow-job?
	因为理查德绝对会吸到你精尽人亡为止\N
	Because Richard will suck the dick right off of your pelvis.
	你逗笑我了  狮头男\N
	Now you make me laugh, shaggy man.

	would you guys be interested in buying some candy
	这样我们教堂才能凑够钱去野营\N
	so you can send my church group to camp?
	没兴趣\N
	Nope.
	埃利希  拜托\N
	Erlich, come on.

	她明明就有\N
	Yeah, she did.
	怎么回事\N

	我的老天  伙计\N
	Jesus Christ, man,
	你裹着浴巾我都感觉没法靠近你\N
	I could barely stand next to you when you're in your towel.
	我可不想跟你们搞3P\N
	I don't want to have a threesome with you.
	我不是指3P\N

	塔拉\N
	Tara.
	首先\N
	First of all...
	那么\N
	So, um...
	我仔细考虑过了\N
	I have thought about it.
	想了很多\N
	A lot.
	说实话  这整件事的安排\N
	To be honest, elements of this arrangement
	还是让我不放心\N
	still trouble me.
	但是  我的性经验并不是很丰富\N
	However, I have not had a lot of sexual experiences.
	我觉得要是错过这次机会就太傻了\N
	So I feel it may be foolish to turn this down.
	所以只要吉尔弗约尔不在屋里\N
	So as long as Gilfoyle is not in the room
	能让我检查屋门是否上锁\N
	and I can verify that the door is locked...
	我的结论就是\N
	...then I have concluded that...
	我愿意\N
	...yes...
	我愿意跟你上床\N
	...I would love to have sexual relations with you...
	塔拉\N
	...Tara.
	我愿意\N
	Yeah.
	你在说什么呢\N
	Uh, what are you talking about?
	吉尔弗约尔告诉我了\N
	Gilfoyle told me.
	我知道你想跟我滚床单\N
	I know you want to have sex with me.
	吉尔弗约尔\N
	Gilfoyle?
	你能稍微过来下吗\N
	Would you come in here for a second?
	你告诉迪尼希我想跟他上床吗\N
	Did you tell Dinesh that I want to have sex with him?
	没有\N
	No.
	等下  哦对  我说过  都快忘了\N
	Oh, wait, yeah, I totally did. I forgot about that.
	我当时嗑了药  就是逗他玩呢\N
	I was really high. I was just fucking with him.
	他相信我了\N
	Did he believe me?
	你刚刚是来向我女人约炮吗\N
	Did you just present yourself to my woman?
	你真是太脱俗了\N
	Oh, this is outstanding.
	我的天  你真恶毒\N
	Oh, my God, that is so mean of you!
	你看他多可爱\N
	Look at how cute he is.
	他超可爱  你很可爱\N
	He's adorable. You're adorable.
	别说我可爱  这让我显得很娘炮\N
	Don't call me ador... It's very emasculating.
	怎么会有人傻逼到相信吉尔弗约尔的话\N
	What kind of fucking idiot listens to what Gilfoyle has to say?
	好了  塔拉  就这么办\N
	OK, Tara, here's what it is.
	如果你当着我的面告诉我\N
	If you can tell me to my face
	你真的认为迪尼希比我更有魅力\N
	that you seriously find Dinesh more attractive than me,
	只有这样我才认输\N
	then and only then will I concede defeat.
	怎么了\N
	What?
	我们的回归测试  已经完成\N
	And our regression test is... done.
	好极了  已经完成  全都测试过了\N
	Yes. It's clear, we all test out.
	系统又稳定了\N
	The system's stable again.
	谢天谢地  现在我们可以进行\N
	Thank God. Now we can move on to
	下一个模块  之后我就可以忘记你的存在\N
	the next module and I can forget you ever existed.
	你能帮我个忙吗\N
	Can you do me a favor?
	别告诉别人是我把系统搞垮了\N
	Don't tell anyone I cratered this bad?
	如果你不告诉别人你在这里工作过\N
	I won't tell anyone I hired you
	我就不会告诉任何人我雇过你\N
	if you won't tell anyone you worked here.
	跟'美国银行'的处理一样\N
	Oh, the BofA deal.
	没问题\N
	Got it.
	我去给我妈妈打电话  叫她来接我\N
	Well, I'm gonna call my mom and have her pick me up.
	你妈妈\N
	Your mom?
	顺便说一句  你欠我两万美元\N
	Oh, by the way, you owe me 20 thousand dollars.
	真是个混球\N
	What a dick.
	这事你得跟贾里德谈\N
	You have to talk to Jared about that.
	贾里德人呢\N
	Where is Jared?
	打扰下  你能帮帮我吗\N
	Excuse me. Can you help me?
	绕过障碍  恢复运行\N
	Obstacle averted. Resuming operations.
	请注意安全\N
	Please be careful.
	请注意安全  请注意安全\N
	Please be careful. Please be careful.

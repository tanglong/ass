片名：《安妮.霍尔》

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
有个老笑话是这样说的
There's an old joke.

4
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,920
有两位老妇人去卡茨基尔山旅游
Two elderly women are at a Catskill mountain resort.

5
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,080
其中一个说："哎，这地方的食物可真够糟的！"
One says, "The food at this place is really terrible. "

6
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,040
另一个说： "可不是嘛，给的份量又那么少"
The other says, "I know, and such small portions. "

7
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,960
你瞧，我对生活的看法基本上也是如此
That's essentially how I feel about life:

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,600
尽管充满了寂寞、痛苦、悲惨和不幸
full of loneliness, misery, suffering and unhappiness

9
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,720
但又觉得一切都逝去得太快
and it's all over much too quickly.

10
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,440
另一个对我来说比较重要的笑话出自于
The other important joke for me...

11
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,080
格劳乔·马克斯(美国谐星) 一般是这样认为的
is one usually attributed to Groucho Marx

12
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,880
但是我想它最初来自于弗洛伊德的 《智慧以及它与无意识的关系》
but it appears originally in Freud's Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious.

13
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,080
是这样的，我来简要复述一下
It goes like this, I'm paraphrasing:

14
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,320
我永远也不想加入这样的俱乐部 它的会员是像我这样的人
I never want to belong to any club that 
would have someone like me for a member.

15
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,080
这是我成年生活的关键笑话 它说明了我和女人之间的关系
That's the key joke of my adult life in terms of my relationships with women.

16
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,200
你知道，近来我头脑里总有些 奇怪的念头挥之不去
Lately the strangest things have been going through my mind

17
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,760
因为我刚过四十，我想我正经历我一生中的 一个危机，诸如此类的事，我不知道
because I turned 40, and I guess I'm going through a life crisis.

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,440
我并不担心变老 我不是那样的人，你知道
I'm not worried about aging. I'm not one of those characters.

19
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,960
当然，我头顶的头发开始变得稀疏 那可能是你可以看到的我最糟糕的方面了
But I'm balding slightly on top. That's about the worst you can say about me.

20
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,200
我想我是年纪越大状态越佳，你知道
I think I'm going to get better as I get older.

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,120
我想我会成为头上光光 阳刚十足的的那种类型，你知道
I think I'm going to be the balding, virile type

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,880
而不是，譬如说 满头银发、有款有型的那种
as opposed to the distinguished gray.

23
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,440
也有可能我两种都不是
Unless I'm neither of those two.

24
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,520
弄不好我会变成那样一种人 嘴角哩哩啦啦流着哈喇子
Unless I'm one of those guys with saliva dribbling out of his mouth

25
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,520
手里拎着购物袋，颤颤巍巍走进自助餐馆 口中高呼着社会主义
who wanders into a cafeteria with a shopping bag, screaming about socialism.

26
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,280
安妮和我分手了 对此我仍然耿耿于怀
Annie and I broke up, and I still can't get my mind around that.

27
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,760
我一直想梳理出点头绪 在心里拾掇着我们之间关系的点点滴滴
I keep sifting the pieces of the relationship through my mind

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,520
检讨着自己的生活 试图弄明白究竟哪儿搞糟了，你知道
examining my life and trying to figure out where did the screwup come.

29
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,400
一年以前，我们还相爱着，你知道
A year ago we were in love.

30
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,440
有点滑稽，我不是个抑郁的人 我的性格也不乖僻
It's funny. I'm not a morose type. I'm not a depressive character.

31
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,080
你知道，我以前是个 相当快乐的孩子，我想是的
I was a reasonably happy kid.

32
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,080
我在布鲁克林长大，那是二战期间

他最近情绪很低落
He's been depressed.

34

Suddenly he can't do anything. - Why are you depressed, Alvy?

35
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,760
快告诉弗利克医生 可能是他读了什么东西了
Tell Dr. Flicker. It's something he read.

36
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,760
读了什么东西，呃?
Something he read, huh?

37
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,920
宇宙正在膨胀 - 宇宙正在膨胀?
The universe is expanding. - The universe is expanding?

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,640
宇宙代表世间万物 如果它正在膨胀
The universe is everything, and if it's expanding...

39
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,440
那么总有一天，它会四分五裂 那就会是世界末日
someday it will break apart, and that will be the end of everything.

40
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,720
那和你有什么关系? 他不再做作业了！
What is that your business? He stopped doing his homework!

41
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,160
还有什么做头? - 宇宙和作业有什么关系啊?
What's the point? - What's the universe got to do with it?

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,440
你现在在布鲁克林 布鲁克林没有膨胀！
You're here in Brooklyn. Brooklyn is not expanding!

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,360
再过亿万年它都不会膨胀啊！艾尔维
It won't be expanding for billions of years!

44
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,120
我们应该乘着我们还在这儿 尽情享受生活才对！啊，啊，哈哈…
We've got to try and enjoy ourselves while we're here! Huh?

45
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,960
我的心理医生说我夸大了我童年的记忆
My analyst says I exaggerate my childhood memories...

46
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,400
但是我可以告诉你 我是在过山车下长大的
but I swear I was brought up underneath the roller coaster

47
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,560
它位于布鲁克林的科尼岛那一块
in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn.

48
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,760
或许这造成了我的性格 就是有点神经质，我想
Maybe that accounts for my personality, which is a little nervous.

49
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,360
你知道，我有极度亢进的想象力 我的心思总是跳来跳去
I have a hyperactive imagination. My mind tends to jump around a little.

50
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,760
有时会分不清幻想和现实的界限
I have some trouble between fantasy and reality.

我父亲经营着一家碰碰车游乐场
My father ran the bumper-car concession.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,560
那个就是他，我在这儿
There he is, and there I am.

53
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,960
我经常利用碰碰车来发泄我的进攻性
I used to get my aggression out through those cars.

54
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,640
我也记得我们公立学校的那些老师
I remember the staff at our public school.

55
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,920
你知道有这样的说法 那些干不了啥事的，就去教书
We had a saying, "Those who can't do, teach...

56
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,120
那些教不了啥书的，就去教体育
and those who can't teach, teach gym. "

57
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,400
当然，那些啥事都干不了的，我想 都被派到我们学校来了
And those who couldn't do anything, I think, were assigned to our school.

58
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,600
我得承认，我一直认为 我的同学都是些白痴
I must say, I always thought my schoolmates were idiots.

59
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,480

And Ivan Ackerman, always the wrong answer. Always!

62
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,040
七加三等于九
Seven and three is nine.

63
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,200
那时我就知道他们都是些混球
Even then I knew they were just jerks.

64
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,640
早在1942年，我就开始对女性发生兴趣

That's the second time this month! Step up here.

67
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,360
我做错什么了? - 快站过来！
What did I do? - Step up here.

68
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,920
我做错什么了? - 你应该为自己的行为感到羞耻
What did I do? - You should be ashamed of yourself.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,800
为什么啊?我只不过表达了一种 健康的异性好奇而已
Why? I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.

70
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,160
六岁的男孩不会对女孩产生好奇
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.

71
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,120
我会啊
I did.

72
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,200
拜托，艾尔维 即使弗洛伊德都说有性潜伏期！
For God sakes, Alvy, even Freud speaks of a latency period!

73
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,280
可我从没有过性潜伏期 我情不自禁嘛
I never had a latency period. I can't help it.

74
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,670
你就不能向唐纳德好好学学吗?
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?

75
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,280
这孩子是我们的好典型
There was a model boy.

76
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,640
快告诉大伙你现在干啥，唐纳德

77
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,720
我开了家挺挣钱的服装公司

I lost track of most of my old schoolmates, but I wound up a comedian.

84
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,240
他们不让我入伍
They did not take me in the army.

85
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,880
绝的是，我有四个加(?)
I was 4-P.

86
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,440
是的，如果发生战争，我只能变成人质
In the event of war, I'm a hostage.

87
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,200
你总是把人往最坏处想
You always only saw the worst in people.

88
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,200
你在学校里和任何人都处不好
You never could get along with anyone in school.

89
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,560
你总是和这个世界格格不入
You were always out of step with the world.

90
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,440
即使你已经出名了 你仍然不信任这个世界
Even when you got famous, you still distrusted the world.

91
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,400
我听得清清楚楚 他压低嗓门嘟囔着："犹太佬"
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew. "

92
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,960
你真疯了 - 没有，我没疯
You're crazy. - No, I'm not.

93
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,040
我们正往网球场外走 他和我，还有他妻子
We were walking off the tennis court. He was there and me and his wife.

94
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,080
他看了她一眼，然后他们俩一起看着我
He looked her, then they both looked at me

95
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,200
他压低嗓门说："犹太佬"
and under his breath he said, "Jew. "

96
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,160
艾尔维，你是个十足的偏执狂
You're a total paranoid.

97
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,040
我哪儿偏执啦? 我对这类事情是很敏感的
How am I a paranoid? I pick up on those kind of things.

98
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,520
你知道，有一次我想和全国广播公司的家伙 一起吃中饭，于是我问道:"你吃了吗?"
I was having lunch with guys from NBC, so I said, "Did you eat yet?"

99
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,040
汤姆·克里斯蒂说："没有，犹太佬(你呢)?" 他不说"你呢?"
Tom Christie said, "No. Jew?" Not "Did you?"

100
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,240
他没说"你吃了吗?" 他说"犹太佬吃了?"你明白吗?
Not "Did you eat?" but "Jew eat?" You get it?

101
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,840
麦克斯… - 别叫我麦克斯
Max      - Stop calling me Max.

102
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,480
为什么? 这个名字很适合你 麦克斯，你看什么都像有阴谋
Why? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.

103
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,960
不，我没有，你知道有一次我在一家唱片店 我跟你说
No, I don't. I was in a record store. Listen to this.

104
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,400
有个高高壮壮的、金发剪得短短的家伙 他用一种奇怪的表情看着我
There's this tall, blond crew-cutted guy
and he's looking at me in a funny way.

105
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,280
并冲着我笑着说："对，这个星期 瓦(发德音V)格纳的音乐减价销售"
He's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner. "

106
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,480
瓦格纳，麦克斯，瓦格纳 我知道他到底想说什么
Wagner, Max. I know what he's trying to tell me.

107
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,920
再明显不过了，瓦格纳
Very significantly, Wagner.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,400
行了，麦克斯 去加利福尼亚吧，麦克斯
Right, Max. California, Max.

109
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,440
离开这疯狂的鬼城市  - 想都别想
Get the hell out of this crazy city. - Forget it.

110
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,360
我们搬到阳光灿烂的洛杉矶去 所有的娱乐业都在那儿，麦克斯
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there.

111
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,160
不，我不愿意，你老是跟我提这个 我可不想住在那样一个城市
You keep bringing it up, but I don't want to live in a city...

112
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,200
在那儿唯一的文化上的优势就是 你遇上红灯时可以右转
where the only cultural advantage is you can make a right turn on a red light.

113
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,200
好吧，麦克斯，算了 你和安妮的约会要迟到了吧?
All right, forget it. Aren't you going to be late for meeting Annie?

114
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,440
我和她在"比克曼剧院"门口见 我想我还有几分钟，对吗?
I'm meeting her in front of the Beekman. I have a few minutes left, right?

115
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,160
你上过电视，对吧?
Are you on television?

116
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,400
没有

117
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,160
是的，偶尔吧，个把次
Yeah, occasionally.

118
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,880
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

119
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,800
你没必要知道，没什么大不了的
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter.

120
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,720
你上过强尼·卡森的节目，对吗?
You're on Johnny Carson, right?

121
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,400
有几次吧，你知道，每…
Once in a while.

122
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,920
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

123
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,200
我是罗伯特·雷德福  - 别逗了！
I'm Robert Redford. - Come on!

124
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,280
我是艾尔维·辛格 很高兴认识你，非常感谢
Alvy Singer. Thanks very much for everything.

125
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,040
这是艾尔维·辛格！
This is Alvy Singer!

126
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,240
伙计，你这是…天哪！

127
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,320
这家伙上过电视 叫艾尔维·辛格对吧?我没弄错吧?
This guy's on television. Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?

128
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,600
饶了我吧，天哪   - 这家伙上过电视
Give me a break. - This guy's on television.

129
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,560
我真想找根大号的马球拐棒
I need the large polo mallet.

130
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,800
谁上过电视? - 这家伙，上过强尼·卡森的节目
Who's on television? - This guy, on the Johnny Carson Show.

131
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,320
- 伙计，怎么了嘛，想搞卡车司机 聚会还是怎么着?  - 什么节目?
- Is this a meeting of the teamsters? - What program?

132
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,280
能给我签个名吗? - 你不会要我签名的
Can I have your autograph? - You don't want my autograph.

133
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,160
不，我想要！给我女朋友的
I do! It's for my girlfriend.

134
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
写上给拉尔夫的
Make it out to Ralph.

135
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,680
你女朋友叫拉尔夫? - 那是给我弟弟的
Your girlfriend's name is Ralph? - It's for my brother.

136
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
你真是艾尔维·辛格，那个电视明星?
You're really Alvy Singer, the TV star?

137
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,280
艾尔维·辛格在这儿！ - 行了，行了，幽着点，伙计
Alvy Singer over here! - It's all right, fellas.

138
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,920
天哪，你干什么去了? 绕过巴拿马运河才来?
Jesus, what did you do? Come by way of the Panama Canal?

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,120
我情绪不好，行了吧， - 我站在这儿碰到《教父》的演员了
I'm in a bad mood. - I'm here with the Godfather cast.

140
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,120
你应该学着怎样应付这种事  - 我正应付两个名叫"奇曲(纽约黑手党)"的家伙呢
Learn to deal with it. - I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech.

141
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,680
拜托，我头很疼，行了吧
Please, I have a headache.

142
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,720
你是情绪不好 肯定又来例假了吧
You are in a bad mood. You must be getting your period.

143
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,680
我没来例假！天哪！
I'm not getting my period! Jesus!

144
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,680
每次稍有点不对劲 你都说我来例假了
Every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think I have my period.

145
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,400
你还可以再喊响点 我想那边有一位没听到你说的
A little louder. I think one of them may have missed it.

146
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,520
电影开场了吗?   两分钟之前开始的
Has the picture started? - Two minutes ago.

147
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,680
得，别看了，我不想进去了
That's it. Forget it. I can't go in.

148
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,560
才两分钟  - 抱歉，我不想看了
Two minutes. - We've blown it already.

149
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,920
你知道，我不想放到一半了再入场
I can't go in, in the middle.

150
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,800
放到一半?我们只错过了片头字幕 而且还是瑞典语的
In the middle? We've only missed the titles. They're in Swedish.

151
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,720
你想我们去喝两个小时的咖啡呢 还是怎样?
You want to get coffee for two hours?

152
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,920
两个小时?不，我要进去 - 那你去吧，再见
Two hours? No. I'm going in. - Go ahead. Good-bye.

153
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,600
要是我们不说那么多话 我们早就可以在里面了，你知道吗?
While we're talking, we could be inside.

154
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,400
咳，我们能不能不站在这儿当众争吵? 我感到很难堪
Can we not argue in front of everybody? I get embarrassed.

155
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,960
好吧，好吧，那你想干什么? - 我不知道，你想换一部电影看吗?
All right. So what do you want to do? - I don't know. Go to another movie?

156
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,200
我们去看《悲伤和怜悯》吧  - 算了吧，我们已经看过了
Let's see The Sorrow and the Pity. - We've seen it.

157
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,240
我现在可没心情看一部四小时长的 有关纳粹的纪录片
I'm not in the mood to see a four hour documentary on Nazis.

158
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,240
抱歉，我不能…
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,040
我看电影必须是严格地从头到尾 因为我是"屁眼"(紧张刻板、注重细节)
I've got to see a picture exactly from start to finish, 'cause I'm anal.

160
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,000
哈哈，这个词用在你身上还真不过分
That's a polite word for what you are.

161
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,200
我们上周二看了部费里尼的片子 不算他最好的作品
We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday. It is not one of his best.

162
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,240
因为它的结构缺少一种内聚力
It lacks a cohesive structure.

163
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,040
给你的感觉是他自己也不确定 到底想要表达什么
You get the feeling he's not absolutely sure what it is he wants to say.

164
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,840
因为我一直认为他本质上只是一位 注重技巧的电影人
I've always felt he was essentially a technical filmmaker.

165
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,880
当然《大路》是一部伟大的电影
Granted La Strada was a great film.

166
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,960
之所以伟大是因为它将负面的意象用到了极致，但是，那简单的凝聚内核
Great in its use of negative imagery more than anything else.

167
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,160
受不了这家伙，我要晕过去了 - 不听他的就是了
I'm going to have a stroke. - Stop listening to him.

168
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,400
他对着我耳朵直嚷嚷他的见解啊！
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.

169
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,760
看看他拍的《鬼迷朱丽叶》或《爱情神话》
All that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon.

170
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,920
我发现简直是难以置信地自我陶醉
I found it incredibly indulgent.

171
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,040
他的确是最自我陶醉的电影人之一
He really is one of the most indulgent of filmmakers.

172
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,320
这里的关键词是"自我陶醉"
Key word here is "indulgent. "

173
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,400
你为什么心情不好? - 我错过心理治疗了，我睡过头了
What are you depressed about? - I missed my therapy. I overslept.

174
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,480
你怎么会睡过头的嘛
How can you possibly oversleep?

175
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,160
闹钟没响
The alarm clock.

176
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,400
你知道吗，在我看来你的 这种态度真的是充满敌意?
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?

177
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,120
我知道，因为我们的性生活有问题，对吗?
I know. Because of our sexual problem, right?

178
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,000
你是不是想让在"纽约客剧院"排队的每一个人都知道我们性生活的频率啊?
Everybody in line has to know our rate of intercourse?

179
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,840
这有点像塞缪尔·贝克特
It's like Samuel Beckett.

180
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,560
你知道，我赞赏他的技巧 但是他无法真正打动我(肚子上揍一拳)
I admire the technique, but it doesn't hit me on a gut level.

181
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,280
我倒是希望在这家伙的肚子上揍上一拳 - 行了，艾尔维！
I'd like to hit him on a gut level. - Stop it.

182
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,200
他说话的唾沫星子都喷到我脖颈里了
He's spitting on my neck when he talks.

183
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,320
你知道吗? 你也太自我为中心了！
You know something else? You're so egocentric that

184
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,760
我错过了治疗，可你想着的只有 那会对你造成什么影响！
if I miss my therapy you can only think of it in terms of how it affects you!

185
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,820
这是"世界观"的问题

186
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,040
也许这是他们的第一次约会
They're probably on their first date.

187
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,640
也许那女的是看了《纽约书评》上登的广告应约而来
Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books.

188
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,560
"三十出头学者，希望约一位女性
"Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman...

189
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,400
她对莫扎特、詹姆斯·乔伊斯 和鸡奸有兴趣，"
who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy. "

190
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,320
你刚才说"我们的性生活有问题" 是什么意思?
What do you mean "our sexual problem"?

191
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,800
对于一个在布鲁克林长大的人来说 我还是比较正常的
I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.

192
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,760
非常抱歉，是我的性生活有问题 行了吧?我的性生活有问题！
I'm sorry. My sexual problem. Okay? My sexual problem!

193
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,840
我没读过，那是亨利·詹姆斯的小说对吗?是《螺丝在旋紧》的续篇?"我的性…"
I never read that. That was Henry James' sequel to Turn of the Screw?

194
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,320
这就是电视的影响力
It's the influence of television.

195
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,920
马歇尔·麦克鲁恩(加拿大传媒学家) 称其为具有高强度
Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a high intensity.

196
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
你明白吗?一种强烈的媒体
Do you understand? A hot medium.

197
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,160
我真希望手头有只装满了马粪的大袜套！
What I wouldn't give for a large sock with horse manure in it.

198
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,840
当你排在一动不动的买电影票的队列里 在你身后有这样一个家伙，你怎么办?
What do you do when you get stuck on a movie line with a guy like this?

199
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,880
真让人发疯！  - 慢着！为什么 我不可以发表意见?这是一个自由的国家！
Wait. Why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!

200
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,360
他可以啊， 你有必要这么大声喧哗吗?
He can. Do you have to give it so loud?

201
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,760
你不惭愧吗? 你那样的夸夸其谈，装腔作势?
Aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that?

202
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,960
最逗的是，还…还马歇尔·麦克鲁恩呢！ 你压根就不知道谁是马歇尔·麦克鲁恩
The funny part is, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan.

203
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,400
哦，真的吗?我碰巧在哥伦比亚大学 教一门课，名字是"电视、传媒、及文化"
I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV, Media and Culture. "

204
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,120
我想我对麦克鲁恩先生的认识 还是非常站得住脚的
I think my insights into Mr. McLuhan have a great deal of validity.

205
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,760
哦，是吗?那太有趣了 因为麦克鲁恩先生碰巧也在这里
Do you? That's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here.

206
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,240
因此，让我，让我… 你过来一下，现在告诉他
Just let me- Come over here. Tell him.

207
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,200
我听了你刚才扯的
I heard what you were saying.

208
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,600
你对我的著作一点也不了解 你的意思是我的所有谬误都是错的
You know nothing of my work. You mean my whole fallacy is wrong.

209
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,800
你这样上课能教出什么东西? 简直太不可思议了！
How you ever got to teach a course in anything is totally amazing!

210
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,400
哎，如果生活都像这样的话…
If life were only like this.

211
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,400
《悲伤和怜悯》

212
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,680
1940年6月14日 德军占领巴黎
June 14, 1940. The German army occupies Paris.

213
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,680
全国上下，人们急切地渴望听到、收到的哪怕点滴的消息
All over the country, people are desperate for food.

214
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,200
法国抵抗组织的那些家伙真是勇敢
Those guys in the French Resistance were really brave.

215
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,960
他们不得不一直听 莫里斯·谢瓦利埃(法国谐星)唱歌
To have to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.

216
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,760
是啊，有时我会问自己是否经受得住折磨
I know. Sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.

217
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,720
你?开玩笑吧?
You? You kidding?

218
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,640
盖世太保一收掉你的布鲁明戴尔信用卡 你就会乖乖地全招了
The Gestapo would take away your charge card, and you'd tell 'em everything.

219
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,640
那电影让我有负罪感
That movie makes me feel guilty.

220
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,760
是啊，因为本来就应该如此
It's supposed to.

221
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,680
艾尔维，我… - 怎么了?
Alvy, I  - What?

222
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,920
怎么了嘛！ - 我…我不知道
What's the matter?

223
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,720
这不对劲 我们睡在一张床上
It's not natural. We're sleeping in a bed together.

224
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,640
你看，已经很长时间了！
It's been a long time!

225
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,080
只是…，你看，我是说…
It's just, I mean-

226
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,680
我明晚还要演唱 所以我想休息下嗓子
I've got to sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.

227
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,880
你总是有理由 你以前不是认为我很棒的嘛
It's always some kind of an excuse. You used to think I was very sexy.

228
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,560
我们刚开始约会的时候 可是频繁亲热的
When we first started going out, we had sex constantly.

229
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,160
可能都可以上《吉尼斯世界纪录》了
We're probably listed in The Guiness Book of World Records.

230
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,960
艾尔维，过一阵子就好了 只是我最近这段时间就是不想，就是这样
It'll pass. I'm going through a phase, that's all.

231
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,400
你以前结过婚 你应该知道有的时候就是这样子的
You've been married before. You know how things can get.

232
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,240
一开始，你不也和爱丽森打得火热
You were very hot for Allison at first.

233
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,080
你知道你紧接着克里斯·布朗上场 大概二十分钟以后
You know that you're on right after Chris Brown, in about 20 minutes.

234
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,080
对不起，我什么时候上?
Excuse me. When do I go on?

235
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,040
你是谁?
Who are you?

236
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,480
艾尔维·辛格
Alvy Singer.

237
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,080
我是演喜剧的 - 噢，喜剧演员，对
I'm the comedian. - Oh, comedian.

238
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,880
噢，你是下一个
Oh, you're on next.

239
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,000
你什么意思，我是下一个?
What do you mean "next"?

240
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,080
我是说这个节目完了后，你就上场
You're on right after this act.

241
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,800
不能啊，他也在演喜剧啊！ - 是的
It can't be, because he's a comic. - Yes.

242
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,160
你是说你把两个喜剧节目排在一起啦? - 为什么不能?
You're putting on two comics in a row? - Why not?

243
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,440
不，抱歉，我可不愿意接在 另一个喜剧演员后上场
No, I'm sorry. I'm not going to go on after another comedian.

244
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,720
没事的， - 不，因为他们一直在笑，我还是不上的好
It's okay. - No. They're laughing. I'd rather not.

245
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,120
你别那么紧张，行吗? 他们会喜欢你的，我保证
Will you relax, please? They're going to love you.

246
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,120
我还是不上的好， 因为，你瞧，他们正冲着他大笑呢
I know. I prefer not to. Look, they're laughing at him.

247
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,360
你什么意思? 他们会一直笑个几分钟
What are you telling me? They'll laugh at him a few minutes.

248
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,400
然后我也想要他们的笑声 他们还能再笑得出来吗?
Then I've got to get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?

249
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,120
他们都笑光了啊！ - 你别这么激动行吗?
They're laughed out. - Do you feel all right?

250
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,200
天哪！
Jesus.

251
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,080
你叫什么名字? - 爱丽森，
What's your name? - Allison.

252
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,480
是吗?爱丽森什么?
Yeah? Allison what?

253
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,560
普曲尼克
Portchnik.

254
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,520
普曲尼克?好名子 - 谢谢
Portchnik? That's nice. - Thank you.

255
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,200
这么说，你一直在史蒂文森手下干?
So, you work for Stevenson all the time?

256
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,200
不，不，我正在做我的学位论文 - 论题是?
No. I'm doing my thesis. - On what?

257
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,280
"二十世纪文学的政治义务"
Political commitment in 20th-century literature.

258
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,600
这么说你属于纽约犹太人 左翼自由派知识分子
You're like New York Jewish, left-wing, intellectual

259
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,800
住在中央公园西街、上布兰德斯大学 参加社会主义夏令营
Central Park West, Brandeis University, socialist summer camps

260
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,880
父亲喜欢本·肖恩(犹太画家)的画，对吗?
and the father with the Ben Shahn drawings...

261
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,960
经常喜欢罢工…
really strike-oriented-

262
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,320
如果你觉得我像个十足的白痴 你尽可以打断我
Stop me before I make a complete imbecile of myself.

263
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,640
不，这太棒了！我喜欢被人简单地 从文化上划入某一类(反话)
That was wonderful! I love being reduced to a cultural stereotype.

264
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,040
是吗，我是个固执己见的人，左翼的
Right. I'm a bigot, but for the left.

265
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,920
我要出场了 说点鼓励的话，快
I have to go out there. Say something encouraging, quickly.

266
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,480
我觉得你很可爱 - 是吗?真的吗?
I think you're cute. - Yeah? Do you?

267
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,680
上吧
Go ahead.

268
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,840
我不知道他们怎么会让我参加这样的集会
I don't know why they would have me at this kind of rally

269
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,480
因为我本来根本不是表演政治喜剧的
'cause I'm not essentially a political comedian.

270
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,000
有意思的是，我曾和艾森豪威尔班子里的…
I interestingly had dated a woman...

271
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,040
一位女士约会过，时间不长
in the Eisenhower administration, briefly.

272
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,760
在我看来这真的很滑稽
It was ironic to me...

273
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,720
因为我想要对她"做"的事情
'cause I was trying to do to her...

274
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,600
正是艾森豪威尔在过去八年里 一直对这个国家"做"的
what Eisenhower's been doing to the country for the last eight years.

275
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,720
对不起，我无法继续下去了
I'm sorry. I can't go through with this.

276
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,120
因为我无法忘记这事，爱丽森 它一直困扰着我！
I can't get it off my mind! It's obsessing me!

277
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,040
噢，我真受够你了！ 你要你更加专注一点！
I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.

278
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,080
但是这太说不通了 他的车通过存书房
But it doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository...

279
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,240
可警察确凿地说那伤口是 子弹穿出造成的
and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound.

280
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,480
因此，奥斯瓦尔德怎么可能 同时从两个不同的角度射击呢?
So how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once?

281
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,520
这太荒唐了嘛！ - 艾尔维！
It doesn't make sense!

282
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,080
我来告诉你 他的枪法没那么好
I'll tell you this. He was not marksman enough...

283
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,520
在那么远距离射中一个移动的目标
to hit a moving target at that range.

284
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,920
但是，如果有第二个杀手…
But if there was a second assassin-

285
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,440
那么就结了！ - 我们已经说过这个了
That's it! - We've been through this.

286
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,000
他们找到了从那把来复枪掉出的弹壳
They recovered the shells from that rifle.

287
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,000
好吧，你现在想说什么?
What are you saying now?

288
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,360
沃伦委员会的每一个人 都卷进了这个阴谋，是吗?
That everybody on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?

289
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,000
为什么不会?
Why not?

290
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,080
厄尔·沃伦? - 亲爱的，我不确定厄尔·沃伦是否卷入，
Earl Warren? - Honey, I don't know Earl Warren.

291
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,040
林登·约翰逊?
Lyndon Johnson?

292
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,360
林登·约翰逊?林登·约翰逊是个政客！
Lyndon Johnson is a politician!

293
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,840
你知道那些家伙的道德观 他们比儿童骚扰犯还要低一个档次
You know the ethics those guys have. It's a notch underneath child molester.

294
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,240
那么每一个人都参与了阴谋
Then everybody's in on the conspiracy.

295
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,440
联邦调查局、中央情报局 约翰·埃德加·胡佛、还有石油公司
The FBl and the CIA and J. Edgar Hoover, the oil companies

296
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,680
五角大楼、再加白宫卫生间里的服务生?
the Pentagon, the men's-room attendant at the White House?

297
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,800
我看卫生间里的服务生可以排除掉
I would leave out the men's-room attendant.

298
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:15,040
你这是在用阴谋论 作为逃避和我做爱的借口
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.

299
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,280
噢，我的上帝！她说得对
Oh, my God! She's right.

300
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,440
为什么我要拒绝爱丽森·普曲尼克?
Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik?

301
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,320
她那么漂亮，那么心甘情愿 而且她也真的很聪明
She was beautiful. She was willing. She was real intelligent.

302
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,160
是不是这就像格劳乔·马克斯的 老笑话说的那样
Is it the old Groucho Marx joke...

303
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,000
我只是不想加入这样的俱乐部 它的会员是像我这样的人?
that I don't want to belong to any club that would have me for a member?

304
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,480
艾尔维，不要慌！快抓住它！ - 我早就跟你说过…
Alvy, don't panic! - It's a mistake...

305
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,440
不要把活的东西带回屋里
to bring a live thing in the house.

306
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,400
别，别那样做！ 快抓那边那个
Don't do that.

307
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,880
也许我们应该报警 快拨911，那是专门对付龙虾的分队
Maybe we should call the police. Dial 911. It's the lobster squad.

308
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,360
得了吧，它们只是小龙虾 看在上帝的份上！
They're only baby ones. For God sakes.

309
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,440
它们只是小龙虾?那你把它们捡起来 - 好吧！行了！
If they're babies, you pick them up. - All right! All right!

310
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,280
给你这个！ - 别给我！别这样！
Here you go! - Don't give it to me.

311
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,520
快看！一个爬到冰箱后面去了
Look! One crawled behind the refrigerator.

312
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,840
它晚上会出现在我们的床上 快把那家伙拿开！天哪！
It'll turn up in our bed at night. Get out of here with that thing!

313
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,280
跟它谈谈吧，你不是会说贝壳语嘛
Talk to him. You speak shellfish.

314
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,080
咳，看，快把它放到锅里！
Hey, put it in the pot.

315
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,520
我不能，我不能把一个活的 东西放进热水锅里
I can't. I can't put a live thing in hot water.

316
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,760
给我，让我来，你觉得我们应该怎样做 带它去看电影?
What d'you think we were going to do, take him to the movies?

317
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,840
好，艾尔维！噢，谢谢！
Good. Oh, thank you.

318
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,800
行了，放进去了，它绝对在锅里了
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot.

319
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,520
安妮，有一只大的龙虾在冰箱后面
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator.

320
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,400
我弄它不出来，冰箱太沉了
I can't get it out. This thing's heavy.

321
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,200
也许我放一盘奶油沙司再加把 胡桃钳子在这儿，它就会从另一边跑出来了
Maybe if I put a dish of butter sauce here, it'll run out the other side.

322
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,120
我去取我的相机，等等
I'm going to get my camera.

323
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,680
要是我能撬开…
I think if I could pry-

324
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,080
我们应该买牛排的 因为它们没有腿，它们不会到处乱跑
We should have gotten steaks, 'cause they don't have legs and run around.

325
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,760
噢，讨厌！噢，天哪！

326
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,640
抓着这个龙虾，抓住它，快！ - 你什么意思?现在还要拍照片?
Pick this lobster up. Hold it, please. - You're going to take pictures now?

327
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,240
艾尔维，那很好玩的，噢，太妙了！
Alvy, it'll be wonderful. Oh, lovely!

328
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,880
天哪，太恶心了！ - 再来一张，艾尔维！快点，再来一张！
It's disgusting. - One more, please? One more.

329
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,320
噢，好！好！
Good!

330
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,680
那么这是我想知道的 我是你第一个真正的情人吗?
Here's what I want to know. Am I your first, big romance?

331
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,840
噢，不，不是的

332
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,040
真的吗?那是谁? - 噢，那是齐佩瓦瀑布市高中的丹尼斯
Who was? - There was Dennis from high school.

333
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,720
丹尼斯吗?当地男孩?那么一定在 周六晚上在电影院门口和你约会?
Local kid who'd meet you in front of the movie house on Saturday night?

334
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,560
噢，天哪，你应该看看我那时候的样子 - 我可以想象，也许像个宇航员的妻子
You should've seen how I looked then. - I can imagine. An astronaut's wife.

335
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,440
然后就是杰里，他是演员 - 你看看你
Then there was Jerry, the actor. - Look at you.

336
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,360
真的很可笑
You're such a clown.

337
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,800
我看上去很漂亮 - 你总是很漂亮，但是那个和你在一起的家伙！
I look pretty. - You always do. But that guy with you!

338
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,200
表演，就如同对灵魂的探索 是非常宗教性的
Acting is like an exploration of the soul. It's very religious.

339
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,640
就像是某种意识的解放
Like a kind of liberating consciousness.

340
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,920
又像是一首视觉上的诗歌
It's like a visual poem.

341
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
哈，他那样胡扯不是在开玩笑吧?
Is he kidding with that crap?

342
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,240
噢，对！
Oh, right!

343
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,640
是的，我想我知道你说的 "宗教性的"确切意思是什么
Right. I think I know exactly what you mean when you say "religious. "

344
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,760
你真知道? - 行行好！我那时太年轻了
You do? - Come on. I was younger.

345
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,280
咳，那才是去年啊！
That was last year!

346
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,160
就像是我想起死亡的感觉 你知道我愿意怎么死吗?
It's like when I think of dying. You know how I'd like to die?

347
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,600
不知道，怎么死?
How?

348
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,640
我希望被野兽撕成碎片
I'd like to get torn apart by wild animals.

349
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,320
够猛！被松鼠啃掉 - 咳，听着，他是个出色的演员
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels. - He was a terrific actor.

350
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,600
看看他！长得也很优雅，而且感情丰富
He's neat looking and he was emotional.

351
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,800
对了，我想你不太喜欢感情化的吧
I don't think you like emotion too much.

352
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,600
用你的脚摸一下我的心
Touch my heart with your foot.

353
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,400
我去吐先！
I may throw up.

354
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,880
他的确是有点怪 - 承认了吧！
He was creepy. - Yeah!

355
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,080
我想你遇见我真是很幸运 - 哦，真的吗?呵呵，啦-嘀-哒！
You're pretty lucky I came along. - Oh, really? La-de-dah!

356
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,840
"啦-嘀-哒"，要是以前有人跟我说 我会和一个满嘴"啦-嘀-哒"的姑娘约会
If anyone ever told me that I'd be taking out a girl...

357
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,880
我肯定以为他是个疯子
who used expressions like "la-de-dah"-

358
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,040
是啊，你只喜欢那些纽约女孩
That's right. You really like those New York girls.

359
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,470
嗯，不"只"是啦，不全是啦 - 我看是的，你不是结了两次婚都是纽约女孩吗?
Not just. Not only. - I'd say so. You married two of them.

360
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,000
那位是亨利·德鲁克
There's Henry Drucker.

361
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,040
他在普林斯顿历史系有个位置(椅子)
He has a Chair in History at Princeton.

362
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,160
那矮个的男人是赫歇尔·卡明斯基，他在康奈尔哲学系有个位置(椅子)
The short man is Hershel Kaminsky. He has a Chair in Philosophy at Cornell.

363
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,080
再加两把椅子，他们就可以搞定个餐室了
Two more chairs, they got a dining room set.

364
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,440
你为什么那样充满敌意? - 因为我想在电视上看尼克斯队的比赛
Why are you so hostile? - I want to watch the Knicks on TV.

365
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,680
那是保罗·古德曼吗?不
Is that Paul Goodman? No.

366
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,720
对主人客气点 因为他正在出版我写的书
Be nice to the host, because he's publishing my book.

367
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,760
嗨，道格！那是道格拉斯·外厄思
Hi, Doug. Douglas Wyeth...

368
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,400
"污秽的回收心灵破烂之店" (叶芝：《遗弃马戏团动物》)
The Foul Rag-and-Bone Shop of the Heart.

369
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,080
我真受够了整晚和那些…
I'm so tired of spending evenings...

370
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,120
干"痢疾"活的人 进行假惺惺的探讨
making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.

371
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,560
干"评论"活的人
Commentary.

372
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,440
哦，是吗?我怎么听说"评论"和"异议" 已经合并成了"痢疾"
I heard Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.

373
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,480
别说笑了，他们都是朋友，行吗?
No jokes. These are friends. Okay?

374
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,840
克里夫兰骑士队要输给纽约尼克斯队了
Cleveland Cavaliers losing to the New York Knicks.

375
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,960
你在这儿哪 那外面都是人哪
Here you are. There's people out there.

376
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,720
两分钟前，尼克斯队还领先十四分
Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead 14 points...

377
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,160
可现在他们才领先两分了
and now they're ahead two points.

378
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,960
艾尔维，一帮子脑垂体变异的怪胎…
Alvy, what is so fascinating...

379
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,680
忙活着将只圆球塞进个铁圈子里 究竟有什么吸引人的?
about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff a ball through a hoop?

380
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,800
吸引人的地方在于这是体力活
What is fascinating is that it's physical.

381
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,720
而有关于智力往往是
That's one thing about intellectuals:

382
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,280
知识分子可以看起来很才华横溢 而实则却是狗屁不通
They've proved you can be brilliant and have no idea what's going on.

383
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,040
但从另一方面来说，身体却从不口是心非，就像你我都知道现在该干什么
But, on the other hand, the body doesn't lie as we now know.

384
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,760
别装疯卖傻了！
Stop acting out.

385
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,840
那感觉会很棒的，因为那些博士们都在那儿讨论…
It'll be great, because all those Ph. D.s are in there discussing

386
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,600
离间的模式啥的 而我们却在这儿静悄悄地嘿咻嘿咻
modes of alienation, and we'll be in here quietly humping.

387
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,040
艾尔维，别这样！ 你这是利用性来表达你的敌意
Don't. You're using sex to express hostility.

388
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,760
"为什么你总是把我的动物本能 降格到心理分析的范畴"
"Why do you always reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories"

389
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,720
他一边说一边解她的胸罩
he said as he removed her brassier.

390
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,600
艾尔维，外面有从《纽约客》杂志来的人啊！
There are people out there from the New Yorker magazine!

391
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,520
老天啊！他们会怎么想?
My God! What would they think?

392
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,840
- 该死的警笛！ - 别生气！
- Damn siren! - Don't get upset.

393
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,520
妈的！我已经差不多了！
Damn it! I was so close!

394
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,400
天哪，昨晚是因为有个家伙直按喇叭
Last night it was a guy honking his car horn.

395
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,080
我是说，整座城市不可能完全安静下来嘛！
The city can't close down.

396
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,920
你想让他们把机场也关闭啦? 没有了飞机我们才可以做爱?
You want them to close the airport so we can have sex?

397
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,360
我太紧张了，我要吃一片安定
I'm too tense. I need a Valium.

398
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,320
我心理医生说我应该住在乡间而不是纽约
My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.

399
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,760
我不能住在…我们不能老是讨论这个话题 乡间让我神经紧张
We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous.

400
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,560
蟋蟀到处乱爬，安静得要死 晚饭后也没地方散步
You've got crickets. It's quiet. There's no place to walk after dinner.

401
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,520
还有遮帘后面藏有好多死掉的蛾子
There's the screens with the dead moths behind them.

402
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,720
说不定你还会遇上曼森家族(杀人"家族")或者是迪克和佩里(见影片《卡波蒂》)
You got the Manson family, possibly. You got Dick and Perry.

403
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,400
行了！打住！医生只是说我太精神紧张了！ 他妈的我的的安定在哪儿?
Okay! My analyst just thinks I'm too tense! Where's the goddamn Valium?

404
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,720
好了，现在安静下来了 我们可以重新开始
Okay, it's quiet now. We can get started again.

405
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,440
不行！我的头在抽抽
I can't! My head is throbbing.

406
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,520
你头痛了? - 我头痛！
You got a headache? - I have a headache!

407
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,360
厉害吗?  - 像《群鬼》(易卜生戏剧)里的奥斯瓦尔德(患性病而死)
Bad? - Like Oswald in Ghosts.

408
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,720
上帝啊！ - 你去哪儿?
Jesus. - Where are you going?

409
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,040
我要去洗另一系列的冷水澡
I'm going to take another in a series of cold showers.

410
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,400
麦克斯，我的发球会让你早点回来洗澡
Max, my serve is going to send you to the showers early.

411
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,360
行啊，行啊 还是先回到我们刚才谈论的话题吧
Right. To get back to what we were discussing.

412
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,720
这个国家不支持纽约市就是种反犹主义
The failure of the country to get behind New York City is anti-Semitism.

413
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,600
麦克斯，这座城市搞得很差劲啊
Max, the city is terribly run.

414
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,920
我不是在讨论政治或者经济 那只是包皮
I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.

415
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,920
你逃脱得也太轻巧了, 每当有人跟你的意见相左，你都把它归为反犹主义
That's a convenient out. When some group disagrees with you, it's anti-Semitism.

416
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,400
你没觉得这个国家的其它地方是这样看纽约的
The rest of the country looks upon New York...

417
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,200
好像我们都是些左翼的共产主义的犹太人 而且还是同性恋的色情狂?
like we're left-wing, communist, Jewish, homosexual pornographers.

418
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,760
连我有时候都这样看我们自己了 况且我还生活在这儿呢
I think of us that way sometimes, and I live here.

419
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,200
麦克斯，如果我们生活在加利福尼亚 那么我们就可以天天在阳光下做户外运动了
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day in the sun.

420
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,760
阳光对你没什么好处 我们的父母说是好的东西没有一件是好的
Sun is bad for you. Everything our parents said was good is bad.

421
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,840
阳光、牛奶、牛羊肉、大学，统统无益
Sun, milk, red meat, college.

422
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,420
我知道，但是我…

423
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,400
哎呀，他来了！
Egad, here he comes.

424
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,200
你认识艾尔维吗?这是珍妮特
You know Alvy? This is Janet.

425
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,720
- 这是安妮·霍尔 - 这是艾尔维
- This is Annie Hall. - This is Alvy.

426
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,240
谁跟谁玩呢? - 你和我对她们俩?
Who's playing with who here? - You and me against them?

427
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,320
这不公平 - 我打得不好
That's not fair. - I can't play too good.

428
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,800
我才上过四节课
I've had four lessons.

429
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,760
那么…
Well...

430
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,240
再见
bye.

431
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,760
你打得很好 - 哦，是吗?你也是！
You play very well. - Oh, yeah? So do you!

432
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,760
天哪，这样说话真的好傻
God, what a dumb thing to say.

433
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,520
你说"你打得很好"， 我马上要回一句"你打得很好"
You say "You play well," and right away I have to say, "You play well. "

434
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,640
噢，天哪，安妮
Oh, God, Annie.

435
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,720
嗯，噢，那好！
Well. Oh, well!

436
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,120
啦-嘀-哒，啦-嘀-哒，啦啦…
La-de-dah.

437
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,960
要让我捎你一程吗?
You want a lift?

438
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,360
噢，什么?你有车吗?
Oh, why? You got a car?

439
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,120
没有，我是想叫辆出租
No, I was going to take a cab.

440
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,560
噢，不用了，我有车
Oh, no. I have a car.

441
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,440
你有车?
You have a car?

442
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,050
那么我有点不明白，你如果有车
If you have a car...

443
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,080
你怎么还问："你有车吗?" 听起来像是你想搭我的车
then why did you say, "Do you have a car" like you wanted a lift?

444
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,520
天哪，我不知道，我没想…噗…
Geez, I don't know. I wasn't-

445
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,400
我有辆大众在外面
I got this VW out there.

446
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,120
真的好傻！
What a jerk.

447
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,960
你想要搭车吗?呵呵…
Would you like a lift?

448
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,000
当然好，你往哪儿走? - 我?噢，我上市中心
Sure. Which way are you going? - Me? Oh, downtown.

449
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,960
我上市区外
I'm going uptown.

450
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,360
噢，我也上市区外
Oh, I'm going uptown, too.

451
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,920
你不是说你上市中心吗? - 噢，是的，可是我也可以…
You said you were going downtown. - Yeah, well

452
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,320
我也可以上市区外 我住在市区外，但是…
I can go uptown, too. I live uptown.

453
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,120
怎么了?有个人做伴感觉好点 你知道，我讨厌一个人驾车
What the hell? It would be nice having company. I hate driving alone.

454
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,440
那么你认识珍妮特多长时间了? 在哪儿认识她的?
How long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?

455
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,040
我上她的表演课 - 啊，你是演员！
I'm in her acting class. - You're an actress!

456
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,240
嗯，我拍点广告啥的
Well, I do commercials, sort of.

457
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,600
你小心看着点路！ 你不是纽约人，对吗?
You want to watch the road? You're not from New York, right?

458
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,520
齐佩瓦瀑布市 - 是啊
Chippewa Falls. - Right.

459
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,560
哪儿? - 威斯康星
Where? - Wisconsin.

460
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,240
你开得有点快哈 - 别担心，我车开得很好
You're driving a tad rapidly. - Don't worry. I'm a very good driver.

461
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,400
你想吃口香糖吗? - 不，谢谢
You want some gum? - No, thanks.

462
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,800
它们放哪儿去了? - 别，别，别那样，看着点路
Where is it? - Don't do that. No, no, watch the road.

463
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,640
我自己来，你专心驾车，行吗?
I'll get it. Concentrate, will ya?

464
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,400
我来给你一颗 - 我说，你开车吗?
I'll get you a piece. - Listen. You drive?

465
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,400
我开车吗? 不，我开不了车
Do I drive? No, I got a problem with driving.

466
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,480
- 是吗? - 是的
- You do? - Yeah.

467
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,440
我有驾照，但是我有种抗拒心理
I got a license, but I have too much hostility.

468
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,920
你的车不错，要好好保养
Nice car. You keep it nice.

469
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,440
我能问你一下，这是三明治吗? - 噢，是的
Can I ask you, is this a sandwich? - Oh, yeah.

470
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,120
我住在这儿，噢，我的上帝，快看！ 那儿有个空车位
I live over here. Oh, my God, look! There's a parking space.

471
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,640
不要紧，我们可以从这儿走到马路沿上
That's okay, we can walk to the curb from here.

472
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,680
你想拿着你的网球拍吗? 你想拿着你的用具吗?
You want your tennis stuff? You want your gear?

473
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,520
是的，很好，谢谢 非常感谢
Yeah. That's good. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Well.

474
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,960
那么…
Well.

475
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,680
谢谢 - 谢谢
Thank you. - Thank you.

476
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,480
你网球打得很棒，
You're a wonderful tennis player...

477
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,960
但是你的车开得 是我这辈子见到过的最糟的
and you're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life.

478
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,640
任何地方最糟的 欧洲，英…任何地方，亚洲
Anyplace. Europe. Anyplace. Asia.

479
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,960
我喜欢你的穿着 - 哦，是吗?
I love what you're wearing. - You do? Yeah.

480
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,240
嗯，这条领带是格莱美·霍尔给我的礼物
This tie is a present from Grammy Hall.

481
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,680
谁?格莱美?谁是格莱美·霍尔?
Who? Grammy Hall?

482
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,400
是的，我的格莱美奶奶
Yeah, my grammy.

483
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,480
怎么回事?你难道是在诺曼.罗克威尔(美国风俗画家)的画中长大的吗?你的奶奶?
What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting? Your grammy?

484
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,680
我知道，是有点傻不啦叽的，对吗? - 天哪，我奶奶从没给过我礼物
It's pretty silly, isn't it? - My grammy never gave gifts.

485
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,560
她忙着被哥萨克士兵强奸了
She was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.

486
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,760
那么，再次谢谢你
Well, thank you again.

487
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,320
噢，好
Oh, yeah.

488
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,120
咳，听着，你想不想上去喝一杯或什么?
Listen. You want to come upstairs and have a glass of wine or something?

489
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,520
噢不，不是说你非得去 如果你已经有什么事要迟到了的话
No, I mean you don't have to. You're probably late and everything.

490
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,800
不，那太好了，我很乐意，真的
No, that would be fine. I wouldn't mind. Sure.

491
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,320
我有时间，在我去见 我的心理医生之前，没什么事
I got time. I got nothing until my analyst appointment.

492
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,360
你看心理医生?
You see an analyst?

493
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,040
是啊，有十五年了 - 有十五年啦?
Just for 15 years. - 15 years?

494
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,520
我打算再让他看一年，再不行的话我就去卢尔德(法国小镇，天主教圣地)朝圣
I'm going to give him one more year, and then I'm going to Lourdes.

495
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,440
十五年?不，别逗了！是吗?真的?
15? Nah, come on! Yeah? Really?

496
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,840
希尔薇娅·普拉斯，很有个性的女诗人 她的自杀悲剧…
Sylvia Plath. Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide...

497
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,560
在一些大学里的女孩子们看来居然很浪漫
was misinterpreted as romantic by the college-girl mentality.

498
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,080
是啊，我不知道 我是说，她的有些诗看上去很优雅
Right. I don't know. I mean, some of her poems seem neat.

499
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,360
"优雅"?我不得不提醒你现在是1975年
Neat? I hate to tell you this is 1975.

500
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,720
你知道，"优雅"在本世纪初 就已经开始消亡了
"Neat" went out at the turn of the century.

501
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,000
墙上的那些照片是谁?
Who are those photos on the wall?

502
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,640
噢，噢，你瞧…
Oh, you see...

503
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,640
那是我爹地，我父亲 那是我弟弟，杜温
that's my dad, that's Father, and that's my brother, Duane.

504
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,480
是的，杜温 那边是格莱美·霍尔
Yeah, right. And over there's Grammy Hall.

505
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,360
这是塞蒂 - 塞蒂是谁?
And that's Sadie. - Who's Sadie?

506
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,920
噢，呵呵，塞迪通过格莱美的哥哥乔治 认识的格莱美
Well, Sadie met Grammy through Grammy's brother, George.

507
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,200
乔治人很好，但是他得了种病
George was real sweet. He had that thing.

508
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,480
那叫什么病来着?就是讲话讲到一半 你就会睡过去的那种?你知道吗?
What is that thing where you fall asleep in the middle of a sentence?

509
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,400
嗜眠症 - 嗜眠症，对！
Narcolepsy. - Right.

510
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,080
是这样，乔治有一次去(退伍军人?)联合会 领免费的火鸡
So anyway, George went to the union to get his free turkey...

511
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,680
因为联合会总会在圣诞期间 发给乔治免费的火鸡
because the union always gave George this free turkey at Christmastime...

512
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,120
因为他在一次大战中患上了弹震症
because he was shell-shocked in the first World War.

513
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,000
不管那么多了，乔治排在队伍中间
Anyway, so George is standing in line...

514
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,400
准备领他的免费火鸡
getting his free turkey...

515
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,320
但滑稽的是他突然就睡过去了 而且就再也没醒过来
but the thing is he falls asleep, and he never wakes up.

516
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,960
因此他死掉了
So he's dead.

517
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,240
他死掉了，是啊
He's dead. Yeah.

518
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,760
噢，天哪
Oh, dear.

519
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,520
嗯，很可怕，对吗?你认为呢?
Well, terrible, huh? Wouldn't you say?

520
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,240
我是说太可怕了
Pretty awful.

521
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,480
不过故事倒很精彩 我今天收获颇丰
It's a great story, though. It really made my day.

522
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,520
我想我得走了 因为我觉得我可能影响到你了
I think I should get out of here, 'cause I think I'm imposing.

523
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,600
是吗?也许… - 你知道，我…
Really? Maybe-

524
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,800
你没必要急着走，我说 - 我知道，可是我浑身是汗
You don't have to. - But I'm all perspired and everything.

525
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,360
你没在俱乐部冲个澡吗?
Didn't you take a shower at the club?

526
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,880
我?没有，我从来不在公共场合洗澡
No, no. I never shower in a public place.

527
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,320
为什么不?
Why not?

528
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,360
因为我不想在其他男人面前裸着身子
I don't like to get naked in front of another man.

529
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,800
噢，我明白了
I see.

530
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,200
我不愿意被同性的男子看到我的身体
I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender.

531
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,880
是啊，我想我明白了 - 你不知道会不会发生什么意外的事情
I see, I guess. - You never know what's going to happen.

532
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,040
看了十五年心理医生，哈? - 十五年了，是啊
15 years, huh? - 15 years, yeah.

533
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,080
万事如意
God bless.

534
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,520
是啊！嗯…
Well! Well-

535
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,520
你是那种格莱美·霍尔 会称为"十足的犹太人"的人
You're what Grammy Hall would call "a real Jew. "

536
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,480
噢，谢谢
Thank you.

537
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,720
她讨厌犹太人 在她眼里犹太人只会赚钱，
She hates Jews. She thinks they just make money.

538
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,720
但是我可以告诉你，她自己就是 这样跟你说：嗜钱如命
But she's the one, is she ever. I'm telling you.

539
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,360
那么，里面的那些照片是你自己拍的吗?
So, did you do those photographs in there?

540
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,600
是的，我只是随便玩玩而已，你知道(随便玩玩?听听你自己都说的啥，笨蛋！)
I dabble? Listen to me. What a jerk. Yeah, I sort of dabble around, you know.

541
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,160
拍得不错，很有特性 (你是个漂亮的姑娘)
You are a great-looking girl. They're wonderful. They have a quality.

542
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,280
是吗，我倒愿意参加一个正规的摄影课程 (也许他会认为我很愚蠢)
He probably thinks I'm a yo-yo. Well,
I would like to take a serious photography course.

543
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,160
摄影很有意思，因为…
Photography's interesting because...

544
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,440
这是一种新的艺术形式一系列的美学标准还没建立起来(我想看看她不穿衣服的样子)
I wonder what she looks like naked. it's a new art form. 
A set of aesthetic criteria have not emerged yet.

545
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,160
美学标准?你的意思是如何判断一幅摄影的好坏,是吗?(我在他眼里一定显得很笨，认了吧)
I'm not smart enough for him. Hang in there.
You mean whether it's a good photo or not?

546
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,040
摄影工具会对艺术形式本身的状态起到作用(我不知道自己在瞎掰啥她一定感觉到了我的浅薄)
I don't know what I'm saying. She senses I'm shallow. The
medium enters in as a condition of the art form itself.

547
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,840
嗯，对我来说，我的意思是…都是出于直觉(老天，我希望他别像其他人一样到头来也是一个混蛋)
God, I hope he doesn't turn out to be a schmuck like
the others. Well, to me- I mean- It's all instinctive.

548
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,560
我只是试着去感觉，试着去把握，而并没有考虑得太多，
I just try to feel it, to get a sense of it and not think about it so much.

549
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:00,920
问题是，从社会的角度来看 你还是需要些审美的导向的，我想
(天哪，我的话听上去像是调频广播，放松点！)
Christ, I sound like FM radio. Relax. Still, you need
aesthetic guidelines to put it in social perspective.

550
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,560
我不知道 我想你是不是快要迟到啦
I don't know. I mean, I guess you must be sort of late.

551
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,160
你知道，我马上可以 开始到医生那里大倒苦水了
You know, I've got to get there and begin whining soon.

552
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,120
你星期五晚上有事吗?
Are you busy Friday night?

553
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,280
我?噢，没有
Me? Oh, no.

554
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,440
噢，对不起，等等，我有事 星期六晚上呢?
Oh, I'm sorry, I have something. What about Saturday night?

555
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,360
没有，没事，
Nothing. No, no.

556
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,560
我可以看出来 你可真够受欢迎的哈！(反话)
You're very popular, I can see.

557
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,480
我知道 - 怎么?你有瘟疫?
I know. - You have plague?

558
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,960
我碰到过太多的混蛋
I meet a lot of jerks.

559
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,920
是吗?我也碰到过很多混蛋
I meet a lot of jerks, too.

560
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
我在想是否养几只猫算了
I'm thinking about getting some cats.

561
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,680
噢，等一下！不，不！噢，见鬼！
Wait a second! No, no! Oh, shoot!

562
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,000
星期六晚上我要去…我要去唱歌
Saturday night, I'm going to sing.

563
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,480
你要去唱歌?你唱歌?没开玩笑?
You're going to sing? You sing? No kidding!

564
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,400
- 这是我第一次演唱 - 真的吗?在哪儿啊?
- This is my first time. - Really? Where?

565
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,640
我想去听听
I'd like to come.

566
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,770
- 不，不，我只是… - 我很有兴趣
- I'm interested. - No, no. I'm just a-

567
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,300
我只是在那家夜总会试唱一下 是我的第一次
I'm auditioning at this club. It's my first time.

568
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,720
没事的，因为我知道夜总会是怎么回事
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like.

569
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,080
听着，你会喜欢夜总会的 真的会很有乐趣的
You're going to like nightclubs. They're really a lot of fun.

570
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,160
<i>那一定是你</i>
It had to be you

571
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:19,520
<i>那一定是你</i>
It had to be you

572
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,720
<i>我四处徘徊，最终发现</i>
I wandered around And finally found

573
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:32,000
<i>这某个人</i>
This somebody who

574
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,360
<i>能使我真诚</i>
Could make me be true

575
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:43,400
<i>能使我忧郁</i>
Could make me be blue

576
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,240
<i>甚至快乐</i>
And even be glad

577
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,800
<i>想起你</i>
Just to be sad

578
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,680
<i>就使我忧伤</i>
Thinking of you

579
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,920
我糟透了！我真丢脸！ 我根本不会唱歌
I was awful! I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.

580
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
只是观众有一丁点不安分
So the audience was a tad restless.

581
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,240
你什么意思，"一丁点不安分"? 噢，我的上帝啊，他们讨厌我！
What do you mean, "a tad restless"? My God, they hated me!

582
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,600
不，他们没讨厌你 你的声音很棒的
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.

583
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,600
我打算放弃了 - 我不会让你放弃的
I'm going to quit. - I'm not going to let you.

584
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,040
你的声音很美妙 - 真的吗?你真这样想的?
You have a great voice. - Do you think so, really?

585
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,240
真的！非常出色 - 你知道吗?我甚至从没上过这方面的课
Yeah! It's terrific. - I never even took a lesson either.

586
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,600
- 听着，听着，吻我一下 - 真的吗?
- Listen, give me a kiss. - Really?

587
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,240
为什么不?因为我们会呆到 很晚才回家，是吗?
Why not? Because we're just going to go home later.

588
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,680
我们还没接过吻 所以总有些不自在
There's going to be all that tension. We've never kissed before.

589
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,760
我会一直在想该什么时候吻你什么的
I'll never know when to make the right move.

590
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,520
所以我们现在吻一下，就可以克服掉紧张 然后我们就可以去吃饭了，行吗?
We'll kiss now and get it over with, and then we'll go eat. Okay?

591
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,840
我们就可以更好地消化食物了
We'll digest our food better.

592
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,720
好，现在我们可以去消化食物了
Okay? Now we can digest our food.

593
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,920
请来份咸牛肉
Corned beef, please.

594
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
我要五香熏牛肉、白面包
I'm having pastrami on white bread...

595
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,880
还有蛋黄酱、西红柿、和生菜
with mayonnaise, tomatoes and lettuce.

596
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,520
那么，你第二任妻子离开了你
So, your second wife left you.

597
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,160
你为此觉得沮丧吗?
Were you depressed about that?

598
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,720
没什么，吃一点强力维他命就好了
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.

599
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,480
你的第一个妻子，爱丽森? - 对，她很好
Your first wife, Allison. - She was nice.

600
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,920
但是，你知道，那是我的错，我太疯狂了
That was my fault. I was too crazy.

601
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,200
感觉真好！感觉真好
That was so nice! That was nice.

602
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,000
就像巴尔扎克说的："这是一部新的小说"
As Balzac said, "There goes another novel. "

603
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,720
你好棒！
You were great.

604
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,240
噢，是吗?是吗?
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

605
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,280
- 是的，我失魂落魄了 - 你失魂落魄了
- Yeah, I'm wrecked. - You're wrecked.

606
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,720
真的，我再也不弹钢琴了
I mean it. I'll never play the piano again.

607
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,760
我不知道 你真的认为很棒吗?
It was, I don't know. You really thought it was good?

608
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:37,080
很棒?是的，岂止很棒，这简直是我获得的 不发出笑声的最大的乐趣了
Good? Yes. No, that was the most fun I've had without laughing.

609
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,960
给，想吸一口吗?
Here, you want some?

610
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,280
不，我不用任何大的致幻药
No, I don't use any major hallucinogenics.

611
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,640
因为我以前吸过一次 大概五年前在一次聚会上
I took a puff about five years ago at a party...

612
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,880
结果是我试图把我的裤子从头上脱下来 卡在我的一只耳朵上了
and tried to take my pants off over my head.

613
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:59,400
我不知道，我也不经常吸 只是有时想放松一下自己
I don't do it very often. It just sort of relaxes me.

614
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,080
- 可能有点难以置信，但是… - 怎么?怎么啦?
- You won't believe this, but- - What?

615
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,340
《死亡和西方思想》、《拒绝死亡》

616
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,280
咳，我要给你买这两本书
I'm going to buy you these books...

617
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,120
因为我认为你应该读这些书 而不是什么养猫经
because I think you should read them instead of that cat book.

618
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,560
这些是很严肃的东西啊
That's pretty serious stuff.

619
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,680
是的，因为你知道 我对死亡很着迷，我想是的
I'm obsessed with death, I think.

620
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,680
这对我来说是个很重要的主题 我对人生的看法非常悲观
It's a big subject with me. I have a pessimistic view of life.

621
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,000
如果你想和我在一起 你就应该了解我的这方面
You should know this about me if we're going to go out.

622
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,120
我觉得人生可以划分为 "可怕"和"可悲"两种
I feel that life is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.

623
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,120
就是这两种类别，你知道
Those are the two categories.

624
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,720
"可怕"包括那些，我不知道 绝症病人啊、盲人啊、残疾人啊
The horrible would be like terminal cases and blind people, cripples.

625
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,200
我不知道他们怎样度过这一生 简直不可思议，你知道
I don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.

626
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,280
而剩下的都是"可悲"的
And the miserable is everyone else.

627
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,360
因此你在度过这一生时 应该感到庆幸自己是个"可悲"的人
So when you go through life, be thankful that you're miserable.

628
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,600
因为你运气好才成为"可悲"的人的
You're very lucky to be miserable.

629
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,080
瞧那边那个家伙，他是"粉红衣服"先生 他是"迈阿密海滩"先生
Look at that guy. There's Mr. Miami Beach in the pink.

630
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,800
他才参加金拉米纸牌的决赛圈回来
He's just come back from the gin rummy finals.

631
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,640
拿了个第三名
He placed third.

632
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,600
瞧那两个家伙，那么开心 他们才从火岛回来
Look at these guys. That's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island.

633
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,440
像是抓住了一次浪漫的机会
They're sort of giving it a chance romantically.

634
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,280
噢，这个是意大利人，对吗? - 他?对，他是黑手党
Italian, right? - Him? He's the Mafia.

635
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,520
亚麻供应商或混凝土及工程承包商，我猜是
Linen supply business or cement and contracting.

636
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,840
"噢，天哪，我应该在胡子上上点蜡的"
Oh, gee, mess up my moustache wax.

637
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,800
这位是"杜鲁门·卡波蒂模仿比赛"的优胜者
There's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.

638
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,480
你极度地性感，难以置信地性感，是的，你是的 - 不，才不是呢
You are unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are.

639
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,240
因为你知道你怎么样吗? 你有"多种形态的乖张反常"
You know what you are? You're polymorphously perverse.

640
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,760
那是什么意思? 我不知道那是什么
What does that mean? I don't know what that is.

641
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,640
你在床上非常特别
You're exceptional in bed...

642
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,560
因为当我碰到你身体的任何一部分时 你都会有快感
because you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch it.

643
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,320
譬如你的鼻尖，如果我敲你的牙齿 或拍你的膝盖
Like the tip of your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your knee caps...

644
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,480
你一定马上就兴奋了
you certainly get excited.

645
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,680
你知道吗?我喜欢你，我真的很喜欢你
You know what? I like you, I really do.

646
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,560
但是你爱不爱我? 这才是关键问题
But do you love me? That's the key question.

647
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,880
我知道我们认识的时间还不长
I know you've only known me a short while.

648
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,720
我想那是…是的，是的
I think that's sort of- Yeah, yeah.

649
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,680
你爱我吗?
Do you love me?

650
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,040
"爱"是一个太弱的词—— 我"嗳"你，你知道
Love is too weak a word for what- I "lurve" you.

651
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,160
我"暧"你，我"瞹"你，"口"越来越多 是的，我得发明点…
I "loave" you. I "luff" you, with two "f"s.

652
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,320
我当然是的，你不觉得吗?
Of course I do. Don't you think I do?

653
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,400
我不知道
I don't know.

654
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,920
你什么意思? 你不是想放弃你自己的公寓吧，是吗?
What do you mean? You're not going to give up your own apartment, are you?

655
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,840
- 我想放弃 - 但是，为什么啊?
- Of course. - But why?

656
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,080
我搬来和你一起住啊，这就是为什么
I'm moving in with you, that's why.

657
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,080
- 但是你的公寓不错啊 - 我的公寓很小
- But you have a nice apartment. - I have a tiny apartment.

658
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,080
- 我知道它很小， - 对！而且里面的水管也坏了，还有好多虫子
- I know it's small. - And it's got bad plumbing and bugs.

659
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:23,840
行，同意！水管坏了、有好多虫子 但是，听起来那像是坏事似的
Granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs. You say that like it's a negative.

660
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,000
你知道虫子是…
Bugs are-

661
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,800
昆虫学是一门正在快速发展的学科 - 你不愿意我和你住在一起！
Entomology is a rapidly growing field. - You don't want me to live with you.

662
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,680
- 我不愿意你和我住在一起?谁这样想的? - 我
- I don't? Whose idea was it?  - Mine.

663
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,960
是的，事实上是你这样想的
It was yours, actually.

664
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,280
但是，我也立刻同意了
But I approved it immediately.

665
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,200
我猜你是以为 我想把自己的意愿强加在你身上
You think I talked you into something.

666
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,640
没有，我们住在一起，我们睡在一起 我们吃在一起
No. We live together, we sleep together, we eat together.

667
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,920
天哪，你不会想让我们看起来 已经结婚了吧，是吗?
Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do you?

668
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,800
有什么区别吗? - 你有你自己的住处，那么就有区别
How is it any different? - Because you keep your own apartment.

669
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,280
因为它在那儿，尽管我们可以不去住 我们可以不去管它
It's there. We don't have to go to it, deal with it...

670
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:58,240
但是它就像一只在水面上漂着的救生筏有了它，我们就知道我们没有结婚
but it's like a free-floating life raft that we know that we're not married.

671
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,720
那套小公寓一个月要400美元，艾尔维！
That little apartment is $400 a month, Alvy.

672
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,760
那地方要400美元一个月? - 是的
That place is $400 a month? - Yes, it is.

673
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,800
里面的那些坏水管和虫子?老天
It's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus.

674
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,720
让报税员作为我课税减免的一款 我来替你付好了
My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction. I'll pay for it.

675
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,320
你认为我不够聪明 老是想糊弄我，是吗?
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.

676
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,000
别荒唐了
Don't be ridiculous.

677
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,200
那你为什么老是逼着我去修 大学里的那些课程，好像我是个笨蛋似的
Then why are you always pushing me to take college courses like I was dumb?

678
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,320
因为成人教育是件极好的事！
Adult education is a wonderful thing!

679
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,960
你会遇上许多有意思的教授 你知道，那很激励人的
You meet a lot of interesting professors. It's stimulating.

680
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,720
这听起来像是一门好的课吗 《现代美国诗歌》?
Does this sound like a good course: "Modern American Poetry"?

681
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,160
噢，看看这个…
Or, let's see...

682
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,640
也许我应该选《小说入门》
maybe I should take "Introduction to the Novel. "

683
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,200
只要不选要让你读《裴欧沃夫》 (英格兰诗史)的课就行
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.

684
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,240
什么?
What?

685
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,560
嗨，听着，你认为怎么样? 我们要不要去参加在南汉普敦的聚会?
What do you think? Should we go to that party in South Hampton?

686
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,920
不，别傻了，我们还需要别人干吗?
No, don't be silly. What do we need other people for?

687
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,680
我们应该马上关灯 开始玩藏"腊肠"之类的游戏
We should just turn out the lights and play hide the "salam" or something.

688
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,600
嗯，我去拿根烟，行吗?
Well, I'm going to get a cigarette, okay?

689
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:12,680
麻烟，对吗?幻想着那会使白种女人 更像比莉·霍利戴(美国黑人爵士女歌手)
Grass, right? The illusion that it makes a white woman more like Billie Holiday.

690
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,800
- 你没在做爱时磕过药吗? - 我?没有
- Have you ever made love high? - Me? No.

691
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,360
你知道，如果我用大麻或酒精 那我就会过分出色了
If I have grass or alcohol, I get unbearably wonderful.

692
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,320
难以言表地出色
I get too wonderful for words.

693
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,160
我不明白为什么每次我们做爱 你都要用药来兴奋
I don't know why you have to get high every time we make love.

694
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,000
那让我放松
It relaxes me.

695
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,520
在我们上床之前， 你非得拿人造的药物来放松吗?
You have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?

696
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,680
有什么区别吗?
What's the difference, anyway?

697
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,280
我要给你来一针喷妥撒钠(麻醉药) 这样你就可以睡过去了
I'll give you a shot of Sodium Pentothal. You can sleep through it.

698
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,560
得了吧，瞧瞧谁在说话！ 是你看了十五年心理医生好吧
Look who's talking! You've been seeing a psychiatrist for 15 years.

699
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,040
你应该吸一些这个 那样你就可以立马摆脱心理医生了
You should smoke some of this. You'd be off the couch in no time.

700
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,280
行了，你不需要这个 - 你要干吗?
Come on, you don't need that. - What are you doing?

701
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,880
- 别，艾尔维，求你了！ - 至少这一次你可以不抽
- No, Alvy, please? - You can live without it once.

702
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,760
等一下，我有个好主意
Wait, I got a great idea.

703
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,480
稍等一会儿，我有件小玩意 一件起性的小玩意
Hang in there for a second. I got a little erotic artifact

704
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,480
我从城里带来的，我认为那会棒极了
that I brought up from the city, which I think is going to be perfect.

705
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,240
你看，制造出一点新奥尔良的旧城氛围
There. Create a little old New Orleans essence.

706
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,360
现在我们可以开始干活了
Now we can go about our business...

707
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,200
如果我们愿意的话 甚至都可以来冲相片了
and even develop photographs if we want to.

708
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,760
- 有什么不对劲吗? - 没有，怎么了?
- Is something wrong? - No, why?

709
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,640
我不知道，你有点心不在焉
I don't know. It's like you're removed.

710
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,560
不，我还好
No, I'm fine.

711
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,560
真的吗?
Really?

712
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,160
我不知道，感觉你好像不在这儿一样
I don't know. You seem sort of distant.

713
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,200
就让我们做吧，行吗?
Let's just do it, all right?

714
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,280
只是我的感觉还是什么 你好像没怎么投入感情
Was it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?

715
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,960
艾尔维，你记得我把 画画的本子放哪儿了吗?
Alvy, do you remember where I put my drawing pad?

716
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,760
因为你们俩干你们的 我想我还是来画点画好了
Because while you two are doing that, I'm going to do some drawing.

717
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,000
看到没有 那就是我说的"心不在焉"！
That's what I call removed!

718
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,800
唉，你有我的身体
You have my body.

719
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,530
但是，那样感觉不好，我要你的全部！
But I want the whole thing!

720
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,730
但是我需要大麻，你也应该来点
I need grass.

721
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,440
但是你抽大麻让我很沮丧
It ruins it for me if you have grass.

722
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,360
因为，你知道，譬如说，我在演喜剧 如果我从一个磕了药的家伙那里赢得了笑声
I'm like a comedian, so if I get a laugh from a person who's high...

723
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,280
那压根就不作数嘛，你知道 因为他们一直在笑嘛
it doesn't count, 'cause they're always laughing.

724
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,000
你一直那么搞笑吗?
Were you always funny?

725
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,640
咳，这是什么?是在采访吗? 我们应该做爱才对嘛
Is this an interview? We're supposed to be making love.

726
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,920
这家伙天生很搞笑 我想他能为你写点什么
This guy is naturally funny. I think he can write for you.

727
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,640
是啊，是啊，咳，小子 他告诉我你很不错
Yeah, yeah. Hey, kid, he tells me you're really good.

728
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,160
那么我来解释下我的表演风格 你会说我乍一看上去…
Let me explain how I work. You can tell off the bat...

729
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,960
并不像是个有趣的家伙 不像有些人，你知道
that I don't look like a funny guy like some of the guys.

730
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,280
他们一出场你就知道他们会讲些故事 然后逗得你笑翻在地
You know they're going to tell you their stories, you're going to fall down.

731
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,000
但是我有真正的才能 我的笑料必须非常具有感染力
But I gotta be really talented. Material's got to be sensational for me.

732
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,840
因为我的表演，你知道，很…很… 我讲究某种品味，你知道我的意思吗?
I work- I'm kind of classy. Know what I mean?

733
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,160
我来解释一下 比如说，我会用一首歌来开场
Let me explain. I'll open with an opening song.

734
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,120
像这样的音乐开始…
The music will start.

735
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,880
<i>我走出来 "这地方看起来真不错"</i>
I walk out. Place looks wonderful from here

736
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,560
<i>"你们瞧上去也很棒"</i>
You folks look wonderful from here

737
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,120
<i>"看到你们坐在那儿笑容挂在脸上"</i>
And seeing you there With a smile on your face

738
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,480
<i>"令我高喊，这就是我的地方"</i>
Makes me shout This must be the place

739
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,520
我在半当中猛然停下，然后开始讲笑话 这里我就需要你来给我写点东西了
I stop, and then I open with some jokes. That's where I need you.

740
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,160
比如像这样的，我会说："咳，我才从 加拿大回来，你知道，那儿的人说很多法语"
I'll say, "I just got back from Canada. They speak a lot of French.

741
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,040
"我记得的唯一的词是‘黑厕所(法语"圣女贞德"的谐音)’ 意思是洗手间里的灯坏(关)了"
The only word to know is John Dark.  It means the light's out in the bathroom.

742
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:53,320
- "噢，我碰到个大块头的伐木工人…" - 天哪，这个家伙可真够戗
- I met a big lumberjack. " - Jesus, this guy's pathetic.

743
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,920
瞧瞧他那副装腔作势的德行 天哪，还真以为自己超可爱呢
Look at him mincing around. Boy, thinks he's real cute.

744
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,160
我都要吐了
You want to throw up.

745
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,480
让我以后都不敢讲我自己的笑话了
If only I had the nerve to do my own jokes.

746
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,920
我不知道自己僵在 脸上的微笑还能保持多久
I don't know how much longer I can keep this smile frozen on my face.

747
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,080
我肯定入错行了，我就知道
I'm in the wrong business. I know it.

748
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,680
可是，亲爱的(法语)
"But, cherie...

749
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,320
我该拿这怎么办呢，嗯?
what will I do with this, eh?"

750
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,920
他说："噢，玛丽，有时你真让我生气！"
He says, "Oh, Marie, sometime you make me so mad!"

751
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,520
他们那样叫着 给我写点这样的东西，你行吗?
They scream at that. Write me something like that, will you?

752
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,400
带点法国味道的 你能做吗?嗯，小子?
Kind of a French number. Can you do it?

753
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,240
我这是在哪儿? 我一直…我得重新熟悉下环境
Where am I? I have to reorient myself.

754
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,000
这是威斯康星大学，对吗?
This is the University of Wisconsin, right?

755
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,520
因为我到大学里表演 总是令我紧张兮兮
Because I'm always tense when I'm playing a college.

756
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,000
我上大学的记录非常糟糕 我上过纽约大学
I have a bad history with colleges. I went to New York University.

757
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,800
我在纽约大学的第一年就被开除了
And I was thrown out of NYU my freshman year...

758
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,720
原因是我期终考 《形而上学(玄学)》时作弊
for cheating on my metaphysics final.

759
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:52,280
你知道，我偷看进了 坐在我旁边的那小子的心灵
I looked within the soul of the boy sitting next to me.

760
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,360
我被赶出来后，我妈妈是一个情绪 很容易激动的女人，把自己锁在卫生间里
My mother, an emotionally high-strung woman, locked herself in the bathroom

761
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,400
吞服了过量的麻将牌
and took an overdose of mah-jongg tiles.

762
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,200
那段时间我郁闷异常 就去看心理医生
I was depressed at that time. I was in analysis.

763
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,880
我有了自杀倾向 实际上，我早就已经自杀了
I was suicidal, as a matter of fact, and would have killed myself...

764
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,470
要不是我的心理医生是个严格的 信奉弗洛伊德学说的人
but I was in analysis with a strict Freudian.

765
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:17,720
他说如果你想自杀，那么你把 你要错过的那些疗程的钱付了先
And if you kill yourself, they make you pay for the sessions you miss.

766
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,720
艾尔维，你太棒了！不开玩笑
Alvy, you were just great. I'm not kidding.

767
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,480
- 这简直…你太优雅了 - 大学里的观众就是棒
College audiences are wonderful.

768
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,520
你知道吗?我认为我也开始越来越多地 理解笑话里所指的东西了
You know what? I think I'm starting to get more of the references, too.

769
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,560
是吗?可是十二点的表演 和九点的表演完全不一样啊
Are you? The 12:00 show is completely different than the 9:00.

770
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,720
噢，我真的非常盼望明天，我是说 那会很棒的，你会见到我的母亲和父亲
I'm looking forward to tomorrow. It'll be nice. You'll meet Mother and Father.

771
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,840
是啊，我知道，他们一看到我就会讨厌我
They'll hate me immediately.

772
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,200
不，我可不这样想，我一点也不认为 他们会讨厌你，恰恰相反
No, I don't think they're going to hate you at all. Contrary.

773
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,520
这是复活节，我们会坐下来一起共进一顿丰盛的晚餐，我想他们会真的很喜欢你的
It's Easter. We'll sit down and eat. I think they'll really like you.

774
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,000
今年的火腿做得不错，妈妈
It's a nice ham this year, Mom.

775
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,040
噢，是的，奶奶一直做得最好
Grammy always does such a good job.

776
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,840
味道真棒
Great sauce.

777
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,280
是的，不同凡响的火腿
It is. It's dynamite ham.

778
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,120
我们去了旧货交换会
We went to the swap meet.

779
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,440
安妮、奶奶、和我 弄来些很不错的画(相)框
Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.

780
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,680
我们玩得很愉快
We really had a good time.

781
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,120
安妮告诉我们 你已经看了十五年的心理医生
Ann tells us you've been seeing a psychiatrist for 15 years.

782
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,160
是的，我正取得极大的进展
Yes. I'm making excellent progress.

783
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,160
不久以后，我躺在医生的睡椅上时 就不用再穿紧身束衣啦
Soon, when I lie down on his couch, I won't have to wear the lobster bib.

784
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,970
杜温和我去了停船的内湾 - 我们一整天在那儿修补船体
Duane and I went to the boat basin. - We caulked hulls all day.

785
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
看到伦道夫·亨特了 还和往常一样喝得醉醺醺的
And Randolph Hunt was drunk as usual.

786
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:46,440
那个伦道夫·亨特啊！ 你还记得伦道夫·亨特吗，安妮?
That Randolph Hunt! You remember Randy Hunt, Annie.

787
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,160
- 他以前和你在同一个合唱队 - 噢，记得，
- He was in the choir with you. - Oh, yes.

788
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,640
真不敢相信这样一家子
I can't believe this family.

789
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,480
安妮的妈妈确实漂亮
Annie's mother is really beautiful.

790
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,080
他们谈论旧货交换会和停船的内湾
And they're talking swap meets and boat basins.

791
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,720
坐在桌子那头的老太太是个 一流的犹太讨厌者
The old lady at the end of the table is a classic Jew-hater.

792
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,240
他们给人感觉是标准的美国人，你知道 身体健壮，好像他们从不生病似的
They really look American, healthy, like they never get sick or anything.

793
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,360
和我的家庭完全不同 两家可以说是油和水互不相容
Nothing like my family. The two are like oil and water.

794
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,520
啊，让他去死吧 谁稀罕他的生意啊?
Ah, let him drop dead. Who needs his business?

795
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,960
- 他老婆可有糖尿病啊 - 糖尿病?那可以作为借口吗?糖尿病?
- His wife has diabetes. - Diabetes? Is that an excuse?

796
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,280
那男人已经五十岁了 也没有正经工作
The man is 50 years old and doesn't have a substantial job.

797
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,000
那就可以从你合伙人那里偷东西啦?
Is that a reason to steal from your partner?

798
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,440
你在说什么啊?你什么都不了解尽瞎扯
You don't know what you're talking about.

799
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,080
乔治，为他辩护！
Defend him!

800
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,720
把这些胸肉放过去
Pass the brisket.

801
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,240
莫·莫斯科维茨，他有冠心病
Mo Moskowitz. He had a coronary.

802
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,160
别瞎说！ You don't say!

803
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,280
你们怎么过假日呢，辛格太太?
How do you plan to spend the holidays, Mrs. Singer?

804

- 我们斋戒 - 斋戒?

805
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,520
不吃东西，你知道，为了赎罪
No food. You know, to atone for our sins.

806
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,600
赎什么罪?我不明白
What sins? I don't understand.

807
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,720
跟你老实说吧，我们也搞不懂
Neither do we.

808
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:49,920
艾尔维！

809
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,080
嗨，杜温，你怎么样?
Hi, Duane. How's it going?

810
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,040
这是我的屋子 - 哦，是吗? 很不错啊
This is my room. - Oh, yeah? It's terrific.

811
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,000
我能向你说说心里话吗?
Can I confess something?

812
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,880
我告诉你这个，是因为你是个艺术家 我想你应该会理解
I tell you this, because, as an artist, I think you'll understand.

813
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,120
有时在夜晚
Sometimes when I'm driving...

814
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,080
我驾着车在公路上
on the road at night...

815
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,480
我看见迎面的两束车前灯朝我过来，很快
I see two headlights coming toward me, fast.

816
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,840
我有种即刻的冲动 想疾速地拐一下方向盘
I have this impulse to turn the wheel quickly...

817
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,080
直直地撞向开过来的车子
head-on into the oncoming car.

818
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,280
我可以设想那爆炸的情景
I can anticipate the explosion.

819
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,760
那玻璃碎裂的声音
The sound of shattering glass.

820
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,640
那四处流淌的汽油所燃烧起的火焰
The flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.

821
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,600
是的
Right.

822
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:45,400
嗯，我现在得走了，杜温 因为我该回到地球上去了
I have to go now, Duane, because I'm due back on the planet Earth.

823
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,320
- 别太长时间了 - 不会的
Don't let it be so long now.

824
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,960
- 去看看比利叔叔，答应我 - 他很可爱的
- Look up Uncle Billy, promise. - He is adorable.

825
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,320
- 你现在送他们去机场，是吗? - 不，不，杜温可以送
- You'll take them to the airport now? - No. Duane can.

826
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,040
- 我还没喝完呢 - 是的，杜温去吧，我马上回…
- I haven't finished my drink. - Yes, Duane is. I'll be right-

827
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,120
你跟踪我，我不敢相信！
You followed me. I can't believe it!

828
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,080
- 我没跟踪你， - 你跟踪我了！
- I didn't follow you. - You followed me!

829
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,520
为什么啊?因为我走在你后面 隔着个街区盯着你?那不叫跟踪
Because I was walking a block behind staring at you? That's not following.

830
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,120
那你说什么是"跟踪"? - 跟踪不是这样的，我这叫盯梢
What's your definition of "following"? - Following is different. I was spying.

831
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,600
你知道你有多么妄想狂吗?
Do you realize how paranoid you are?

832
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,360
妄想狂?我看到你了 你用你的双臂揽着另一个家伙
Paranoid? I'm looking at you, and you've got your arms around another guy.

833
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,320
这是最厉害的妄想狂了！
That is the worst kind of paranoid!

834
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,920
天哪，我一开始并不想盯你的梢 我以为会给你个惊喜，在你下课后去接你
I didn't start out spying. I thought I'd surprise you, pick you up after school.

835
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,680
哦，是啊，是你希望我们保持这样 有弹性的关系的，还记得吗?这是你的原话?
You wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.

836
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,720
噢，拜托，你要和你的大学教授插上一腿了！
You're having an affair with your college professor!

837
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,280
那个混蛋教什么《西方男人的当代危机》 这都是什么垃圾课程啊，简直难以置信！
That jerk that teaches that crap course, "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man. "

838
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,000
是《俄国文学中的存在主义主题》好吧 你说的真靠谱啊！
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature. " You're really close.

839
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,240
有啥子区别嘛 反正都是些精神上的自渎
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.

840
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,840
噢，是啊，我们终于聊到 你有所了解的题目了！
Now we're getting to a subject you know something about.

841
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,760
咳，别贬低自渎！ 那是和我爱的人做爱
Don't knock masturbation. It's sex with someone I love.

842
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,360
我们没有一腿，他结过婚 只是他认为我比较优雅
We're not having an affair. He's married. He happens to think I'm neat.

843
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,400
"优雅"！你还是十二岁吗? 那是你齐佩瓦瀑布的用词之一
Are you 12 years old? That's one of your Chippewa Falls expressions.

844
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,160
我才不管呢！
Who cares?

845
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,720
接下来他会发现你很热情、你很漂亮，接下来，他把他的手搭在你的屁股上！
Next he'll find you're keen and peachy. Then he'll have his hand on your ass.

846
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,720
自从我跟你提到大卫 你就一直对他充满敌意！
You've had hostility towards David ever since I mentioned him.

847
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,840
- "大卫"?你喊你老师大卫? - 那是他名字
- You call your teacher David? - It's his name.

848
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,440
嗯，听着，这是个好《圣经》里的名字，对吗? 那他叫你什么?拔示巴(大卫王之妻、所罗门王之母)?
It's a Biblical name, right? Does he call you Bathsheba?

849
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:22,440
艾尔维！艾尔维！是你从来不想对我真正负责！
Alvy, you're the one who never wanted to make a real commitment.

850
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,520
你认为我不够聪明 我们上个月才为此争吵过
You don't think I'm smart enough. We had that argument last month...

851
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,120
你不记得那天的事了吗?
or don't you remember that day?

852
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,160
- 我回来了！ - 噢，是啊，怎么样?
- I'm home! - How'd it go?

853
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,080
感觉很怪，不过她人很好
It was really weird, but she's a very nice woman.

854
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,640
她没让我躺在睡椅上，艾尔维 她让我坐在那儿
I didn't have to lie on the couch. She had me sitting up.

855
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,480
然后我告诉她我的家庭 我对男人的感觉
I told her about the family and my feelings towards men...

856
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,600
还有我和我弟弟的关系
and my relationship with my brother.

857
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,280
然后她提到了"阴茎羡慕" 你知道那是什么吗?
Then she mentioned penis envy. Do you know about that?

858
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,480
我?我是为数不多的深受其害的男性之一 所以，你知道…你接着说，我很感兴趣
I'm one of the few males who suffers from that. Go on.

859
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:55,920
她说我对自己经常想结婚生子的冲动 怀有很深的负罪感
She said I was guilty about my impulses towards marriage and children.

860
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:00,400
然后我就记起了当我还是小孩时 有一次无意中撞见我父母在做爱
I remembered, when I was a kid, I accidentally saw my parents making love.

861
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,880
真的吗?所有这些在第一个小时里就发生了吗? 真太不可思议了！
All this happened the first hour? That's amazing.

862
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,440
我看了十五年心理医生了 你知道，我没有这样的经历
I've been going for 15 years. I don't have nothing like that.

863
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,680
我告诉她我的梦，然后我就哭了
I told her my dream, and then I cried.

864
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,120
你哭了?我一次都没哭过 真是太奇妙了！
You cried. I've never once cried. That's fantastic to me.

865
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,360
我呜咽，我坐在那儿呜呜咽咽
I whine. I sit and I whine.

866
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:18,040
艾尔维，在我的梦里，弗兰克·辛纳特拉 拿着个枕头压在我脸上
In my dream, Frank Sinatra is holding this pillow across my face...

867
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,400
我透不过气来
and I can't breathe.

868
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,200
- 辛纳特拉? - 是的，他想闷死我
He's strangling me.

869
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,040
别开玩笑了，噢对了，是的，他是个歌手 你也是个歌手，你知道，这就对了
Sure, because he's a singer, and you're a singer. It's perfect.

870
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,960
你试图闷死你自己，这就很说得通了
You're trying to suffocate yourself. It makes perfect sense.

871
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,240
这是精神分析的某种完美诠释
That's a perfect analytic insight.

872
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:33,760
她说那是你，你的名字艾尔维·辛格
She said your name was Alvy Singer.

873
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,760
- 你什么意思，我? - 是啊，是啊，你
- What do you mean, me? - Yeah, you.

874
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,880
因为在梦里，我打碎了辛纳特拉的眼镜
Because in the dream, I break Sinatra's glasses.

875
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,440
辛纳特拉戴…你刚才没说辛纳特拉戴眼镜 那么你是说我想闷死你?
You never said Sinatra had glasses. Are you saying I'm suffocating you?

876
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,680
噢，老天，艾尔维 我对他做了件真正可怕的事
God, I did this really terrible thing to him...

877
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:51,200
因为他在我梦里演唱时 他的声音高得离奇
because then when he sang, it was in this real high-pitch voice.

878
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,880
医生说什么? - 她说我或许应该一周去看五次
What'd the doctor say? - I should come five times a week.

879
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:59,960
你知道吗?我一点也不介意去做精神分析 唯一的问题是，这会不会改变我的妻子?
I don't think I mind analysis at all. The question is, will it change my wife?

880
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,680
- 会不会改变你的妻子?   - 会不会改变我的生活?
- Will it change your wife? - Will it change my life?

881
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,000
但你说的是"会不会改变我的妻子"  - 不，我说的是"会不会改变我的生活"
But you said "wife. " - No, I said "life. "

882
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,970
不，你说"会不会改变…"妻子 - "生活"！我说的是"生活"！
No, you said "wife. "  - "Life!" I said "life. "

883
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,680
她说的是"会不会改变我的妻子"，你们都听到的 因为你们刚才也在这儿，我没不正常吧
She said "wife. " You heard that, because you were there. I'm not crazy.

884
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,480
艾尔维，然后我告诉她我认为 你从来没把我认真地当回事儿
Then I told her I didn't think you'd ever take me seriously

885
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,880
因为你认为我不够聪明
because you don't think I'm smart enough.

886
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,960
你为什么老是这样说? 因为我鼓励你去修成人教育课程?
Why do you bring that up? Because I encourage you to take adult education?

887
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:25,480
我认为那是件极好的事 你会遇上许多很好的、有意思的教授
It's a wonderful thing. You meet wonderful, interesting professors.

888
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,440
成人教育都是废物垃圾！大学教授 都是超级骗子！你怎么受得了的嘛！
Adult education is junk. The professors are phony. How can you do it?

889
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,920
我不管你怎么说大卫, 她是个很好的老师
I don't care what you say about David. He's a fine teacher.

890
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,120
你干吗要到处跟踪我?真是的！
And why are you following me around? 

891
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,200
我在想我们的关系是不是该到此为止了！
We should call this relationship quits.

892
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,920
很好，很好，太棒了！ 你看，我不知道我哪边做错了
That's fine. That's great. I don't know what I did wrong.

893
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,680
不知怎么的，她就对我冷了下来，是因为我做错什么了吗?
Somewhere she cooled off to me. Is it something that I did?

894
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,000
你根本没做错什么 大家都这样子的，爱会消退
It's never something you do. That's how people are. Love fades.

895
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,920
爱会消退 天哪，这真是个令人沮丧的想法
Love fades. God, that's a depressing thought.

896
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,160
我想问你个问题 先别急着走
I have to ask you a question. Don't go any further.

897
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,920
你和你妻子在床上时，她需不需要某种人造的东西来刺激一下
With your wife, in bed, does she need some kind of artificial stimulation

898
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,720
譬如说大麻?
like marijuana?

899
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,320
我们用一个大的震荡蛋
We use a large vibrating egg.

900
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,200
大的震荡蛋
A large vibrating egg.

901
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,120
得，我去问个精神病人 也可以得到这样的答案，天哪！
I ask a psychopath, I get that kind of answer. Jesus!

902
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,080
这两位，你们看上去像是很幸福的一对
You look like a very happy couple.

903
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,840
- 是吗? - 是啊
- Are you? - Yeah.

904
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,360
那么你们是怎么做到的?
How do you account for it?

905
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:17,560
嗯，我很浅薄和空洞 我没什么想法
I'm very shallow and empty, and I have no ideas...

906
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,760
也说不出啥道道
and nothing interesting to say.

907
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,000
- 我跟她完全一样 - 我明白了
- I'm exactly the same way. - I see.

908
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,960
非常有意思 这么说你们找对某种路子了，是吗?
That's interesting. So you've managed to work out something?

909
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,400
是的
Right.

910
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,160
那么，非常感谢你们跟我谈话
Thanks for talking to me.

911
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,000
你知道，甚至在我小的时候，我就总是 找错女人，我想我的问题就出在这里
Even as a kid, I went for the wrong women. I think that's my problem.

912
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,160
当我妈妈带我去看《白雪公主》
When my mother took me to see Snow White...

913
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,520
人人都爱上了白雪公主 而我却对刻毒的皇后一见倾心
everyone fell in love with Snow White, and I fell for the wicked queen.

914
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,800
- 我们再也不会有任何快乐了 - 你怎么能这样说?
- We never have any fun anymore. - How can you say that?

915
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,280
为什么不能? 你总是寄希望于我改善自己
Why not? You're always leaning on me to improve myself.

916
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,600
你又心烦了，你一定又来例假了
You're upset. You must be getting your period.

917
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:53,200
我没有例假！我是个卡通人物 我就不能偶尔心烦一下吗?
I don't get a period. I'm a cartoon character. Can't I be upset sometimes?

918
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:57,000
麦克斯，你能不能把安妮忘了我认识很多女人你可以约会
Max, forget about Annie. I know lots of women you can date.

919
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,000
我不想跟任何其他女人出去约会
I don't want to go out with other women.

920
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,560
麦克斯，我给你介绍个女孩 你会喜欢她的
Max, I've got a girl for you. You are going to love her.

921
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,460
她是《滚石》杂志的记者
She's a reporter for Rolling Stone.

922
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,480
我想到这儿来看 玛哈利师(印度超在禅定派玄学士)的人
There are more people here to see the Maharishi

923
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:09,080
比去看迪伦(鲍勃·迪伦) 演唱会的人还多
than there were to see the Dylan concert.

924
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,240
我报道了那场迪伦演唱会 简直酷毙了
I covered the Dylan concert, which gave me chills.

925
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:17,440
特别是当他唱道："她像女人一般占有"
Especially when he sang, "She takes just like a woman

926
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,280
她做爱时像个女人
and she makes love just like a woman.

927
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,240
是的，她是的
Yes, she does.

928
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,480
她痛楚时像个女人
And she aches just like a woman...

929
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,720
但是她哭泣时却像个小女孩
but she breaks just like a little girl. "

930
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,640
除了这个 我想我报道过的最有魅力的事件是
Up to that, the most charismatic event I covered...

931
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,200
米克(米克·贾格尔)过生日时 "滚石"乐队在麦迪逊广场花园的那场表演
was Mick's birthday when the Stones played Madison Square Garden.

932
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,840
是的，很棒，的确很棒
That's just great.

933
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,000
你喜欢迪伦吗?
You catch Dylan?

934
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,200
我?没有，我没能赶上那晚他的… 我的浣熊得了肝炎
No, I couldn't make it. My raccoon had hepatitis.

935
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,160
你养浣熊?
You have a raccoon?

936
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,600
有几只
A few.

937
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,440
唯一能形容这个的词是"超妙"
The only word for this is "transplendent. "

938
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,120
- 超妙！ - 我可以想个其它的词
- It's transplendent. - I can think of another word.

939
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,680
他是上帝！我是说，这个人是上帝！
He's God. I mean, this man is God.

940
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,560
他有数百万的信徒 他们从世界各地虔诚地一路赶过来
He's got millions of followers, who would crawl across the world

941
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,360
为的只是触摸一下他那外袍的下摆
just to touch the hem of his garment.

942
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,280
真的吗?那它的下摆肯定巨大无比
It must be a tremendous hem.

943
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,080
- 我自己是蔷薇十字会员 - 是吗?
- I'm a Rosicrucian myself. - Are you?

944
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:07,160
我不太能接受那些在《大众机械》 杂志上打出广告的宗教
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look.

945
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,440
快看！上帝从男洗手间出来了
There's God coming out of the men's room.

946
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,120
简直无法置信地超妙！
It's unbelievably transplendent!

947
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,280
我参加了"滚石"乐队在艾尔塔蒙特的演唱会，那次有个家伙被杀了，你还记得吗?
I was at the Stones' concert when they killed that guy. Remember?

948
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,480
哦，是吗?我有次去听艾利斯·库珀
Were you? I was at an Alice Cooper thing...

949
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,240
现场有六个人因反应剧烈 而被送进了急救医院
where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.

950
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,200
我希望你别介意 我那么长时间才来(高潮)
I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish.

951
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,840
我?不会，别傻了
Me? No. Don't be silly.

952
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:33,240
你知道，我的下巴开始慢慢恢复知觉了
I'm starting to get some feeling back in my jaw now.

953
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,600
跟你做爱真是种 卡夫卡式(怪诞、超现实)的体验
Sex with you is really a Kafkaesque experience.

954
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,640
噢，谢谢
Thank you.

955
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,080
我那样说是赞赏的意思
I mean that as a compliment.

956
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:47,440
我认为性高潮被赋予了过重的负担，你知道
I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm...

957
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,280
好像它是用来填补生活中的所有空白似的
to make up for empty areas in life.

958
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,200
那是谁说的?
Who said that?

959
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:00,520
我不知道，我想也许是列奥泊德和勒布说的 (犹太同性恋青少年、高智商杀人犯)
I don't know. I think it may have been Leopold and Loeb.

960
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,760
喂！
Hello.

961
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,720
呃，没有，怎么啦?
No. What's the matter?

962
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,840
怎么?你听上去很糟
You sound terrible.

963
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,160
没有，什么…好的，我…
No, what- Sure, I-

964
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,360
什么…什么紧急情况?
What kind of emergency?

965
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,080
不，你呆在那儿，你呆在那儿！ 现在我马上赶过来
No, stay there. I'll come over right now.

966
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,360
就呆在那儿，我立刻过去
Just stay there. I'll come right over.

967
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,800
是我，开门，你怎么样?
It's me. Open up. Are you okay?

968
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,360
有什么事?你还好吧?
What's the matter? Are you all right?

969
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,680
卫生间里有个蜘蛛
There's a spider in the bathroom.

970
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,320
- 什么? - 卫生间里有个大个的、黑色的蜘蛛
- What? - There's a big spider in the bathroom.

971
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,760
你凌晨三点把我叫到这儿 就因为在卫生间里有个蜘蛛?
You got me here at 3:00 a. m. 'cause a spider's in the bathroom?

972
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:49,120
噢，我的天哪！你知道我对虫子的反应 那东西在卫生间到处乱爬，我根本睡不着觉
You know how I am about insects. I can't sleep with that thing crawling around.

973
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,600
杀死它！看在上帝的份… 你究竟怎么了嘛！
Kill it! What's wrong with you?

974
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,600
- 你屋里有没有"雷达"罐? - 没有，
Don't you have Raid in the house?

975
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:59,320
我跟你讲过千百遍了 你一定要时时备足杀虫喷雾剂
I told you a thousand times to keep a lot of insect spray.

976
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,680
- 你不知道有什么东西会爬出来 - 我知道，我知道
- You never know who will crawl over. - I know.

977
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,600
还有急救包和灭火器
And a first aid kit and fire extinguisher.

978
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,200
天哪！行了 给我本杂志，因为我有点累了
Give me a magazine, 'cause I'm a little tired.

979
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,440
你知道，你取笑我，你嘲笑我 可是我却时刻准备为你做任何事情
You make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything.

980
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,080
在紧急情况下，像海啸、地震
An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake.

981
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,200
咳，这是什么?你去听摇滚音乐会啦?
What is this? Did you go to a rock concert?

982
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,680
是的
Yeah.

983
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,240
哦，真的吗?你…你喜欢吗?
Really? How'd you like it?

984
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:25,360
那怎…我是说，那过瘾吗? 有没有获得完全的"过瘾感"?还是…
Was it heavy? Did it achieve total "heavyosity"?

985
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,560
那确实很棒！
It was just great!

986
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:31,000
是吗?我有了个奇妙的主意，为什么你不喊这个带你去听摇滚的家伙?我们给他打电话
I've got an idea. Call the guy who took you to the rock concert...

987
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,400
然后他可以过来杀掉蜘蛛 你知道，这…
and he can come and kill the spider.

988
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,000
我找的是你 你想帮我还是不帮?嗯?给你
I called you. You want to help me or not?

989
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,670
这是什么?从什么时候开始你阅读起 《全国评论》来啦?你现在变成什么人啦?
Since when do you read the National Review? What are you turning into?

990
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:42,800
那是我想了解各方面的观点
I like to get all points of view.

991
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,520
太棒了！那你为什么不干脆喊 威廉·巴克利(保守派记者)来杀掉蜘蛛
Wonderful. Get William F. Buckley to kill the spider.

992
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,480
艾尔维！你干吗那么敌视我?你知道吗?
You're a little hostile, you know that?

993
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,360
还有，你看上去很瘦也很疲惫
Not only that, you look thin and tired.

994
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,600
哈，现在是凌晨三点！ 你把我从床上拽了起来
It's 3:00 in the morning. You got me out of bed.

995
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,640
我跑了过来，因为我叫不到出租 因为你说你有紧急情况
I ran over. I couldn't get a taxi. You said it was an emergency.

996
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,680
我没有…我跑上了楼梯
I ran up the stairs.

997
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,640
昨晚早些时候，我还是很有吸引力的
I was more attractive when the evening began.

998
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,920
告诉我，你是…你现在喜欢上 右翼摇滚明星啦?那可能吗?
Are you going with a right-wing rock-and-roll star?

999
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,640
你要不要来一杯巧克力奶?
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?

1000
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:13,280
咳，我是什么人?你儿子?你什么意思?我来是 - 我有很好的巧克力奶，
What am I, your son? I came over for - I've got the good chocolate.

1001
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,160
好的，蜘蛛在哪儿?在卫生间? - 在卫生间
Where's the spider? - It's in the bathroom.

1002
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,520
咳，别拍得稀烂！打死以后 用水冲下抽水马桶，行吗?多冲两次！
Don't squish it. After it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay?

1003
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:24,400
亲爱的，我从三十岁起 就开始杀蜘蛛了，放心了吗?
I've been killing spiders since I was 30. Okay?

1004
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:31,320
那是只非常大的蜘蛛 是的，有大麻烦了，有两个蜘蛛
It's a very big spider. A lot of trouble. There's two of 'em.

1005
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,720
是的，我没料到它会有那么大 但是它是只特大蜘蛛
I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider.

1006
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:38,320
你有扫帚吗，或是雪铲之类 - 噢，我把它留在你房里了，对不起
You got a broom or snow shovel? - I left it at your house. I'm sorry.

1007
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,240
好吧，我来用这个 - 你要干吗?你用我的…
What are you doing?

1008
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,560
亲爱的，在你的卫生间里有个蜘蛛 它的尺寸有别克车那么大
There's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.

1009
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:54,240
- 咳，这是什么?你用黑肥皂? - 用在脸上皮肤的
- You got black soap? - It's for my complexion.

1010
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:58,280
怎么?你加入 "滑稽说唱团(涂黑脸讲笑话)"啦?天哪！
Are you joining a minstrel show?

1011
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,040
不要担心！
Don't worry.

1012
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,520
我杀掉了，两个都杀掉了 你怎么了?
I did it. I killed them both. What's the matter?

1013
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,920
你为什么难过?你想让我抓住它们 把它们养起来?
What are you sad about? Did you want me to capture and rehabilitate 'em?

1014
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
- 不要走，行吗? - 你什么意思?"不要走"?
- Don't go, please. - What do you mean?

1015
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,240
怎么啦?你还担心会有白蚁?
What's the matter? Are you expecting termites?

1016
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,480
怎么了嘛?
What's the matter?

1017
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,160
我不知道，我想你
I don't know. I miss you.

1018
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,920
- 天哪！真的? - 噢，是的
Jesus! Really?

1019
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,680
- 艾尔维? - 什么?
- Alvy? - What?

1020
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:50,120
我打电话给你的时候 你屋里有什么人吗?
Was there somebody in your room when I called you?

1021
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,680
- 你什么意思?  - 我的意思是有没有其他…我想我听到了声音
- What do you mean? - I mean, I thought I heard a voice.

1022
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,600
我开着收音机 对不起，是电视，我开着电视
I had the radio on. I'm sorry, it was the television.

1023
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:07,920
艾尔维，我们别再分手了 我不想分开
Let's never break up again. I don't want to be apart.

1024
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:12,440
噢，好的，我想我们都已经足够成熟 来应付这样的事了
I think we're both much too mature for something like that.

1025
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,240
住在一起不是很好嘛，不是吗?
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?

1026
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,360
我的感觉是很好，很棒，你知道吗?
For me it's been terrific. You know?

1027
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,880
比我的前两次婚姻好
Better than either of my marriages.

1028
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,160
因为你身上有种不同的东西 我不知道那是什么，但是感觉很好，
There's something different about you. I don't know what, but it's great.

1029
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:30,640
你知道，我在想要是你愿意，也许我 可以帮你得到更多的快乐，你知道吗?
I think, if you let me, I could help you have more fun.

1030
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,680
我是说我知道那很难，是的
I know it's hard. Yeah.

1031
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:37,240
艾尔维，这个周末我们出去好不好?
What if we go away this weekend?

1032
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:40,720
为什么我们不带上罗伯 我们三个一起开车去布鲁克林?
Why don't we get Rob, and the three of us would drive into Brooklyn?

1033
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,400
你知道，我们可以带着你看看我们的老家 你会觉得很好玩的，你认为呢?
We could show you the old neighborhood. That'd be fun for you.

1034
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,440
好的，我很乐意
Yeah, I'd love it.

1035
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,560
噢，我的天，今天太棒了！
God, it's a great day!

1036
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:52,240
咳，你看着点路好吗?看着点路！ 你会彻底毁了这车的！
Watch the road! You'll total the car!

1037
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,320
咳，你知道吗? 我以前从没去过布鲁克林
I've never been to Brooklyn.

1038
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,880
- 我等不及了，想去看看我们的老家 - 是啊，老家会感觉很棒的
- I can't wait to see the neighborhood. - The neighborhood will be great.

1039
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,840
- 我们还能带她看看校园操场 - 对，我那时是个运动能手，告诉她，麦克斯！
- We could show her the schoolyard. - I was a great athlete. Tell her.

1040
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,400
- 我是最棒的，我是全能选手 - 是的，我记得的
I was all-schoolyard.

1041
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,840
他是全能选手，有一次有人扔给他 一只橄榄球，他居然想试着运球
They threw him a football once. He tried to dribble it.

1042
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,400
是的，那时我丢掉不少眼镜
I used to lose my glasses a lot.

1043
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,960
噢，看！快看！那是我家的老房子 那是我住过的地方
Look! That's my old house. That's where I used to live.

1044
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,800
我的老天！
Holy cow!

1045
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,560
你很幸运，麦克斯，我以前住过的地方 现在成了一家色情用品商店
You're lucky. Where I used to live is now a pornographic equipment store.

1046
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,760
我有一些很美好的回忆在这儿
I had some very good memories there.

1047
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:21,800
什么样的美好回忆，麦克斯? 你的父母亲总是吵个不停
What good memories, your mother and father fighting all the time?

1048
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,440
不错，而且总是为些最荒唐可笑的事情
And over the most ridiculous things.

1049
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,880
你把清洁房间的女仆开除啦? - 她在偷东西！
You fired the cleaning woman? - She was stealing!

1050
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,000
但是她是黑人 - 那又怎么样?
But she's colored.  

1051
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,340
黑人已经有够多的麻烦了！
The colored have enough trouble!

1052
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,920
她在搜我的钱包！ - 他们已经受到太多的迫害！
She was going through my purse. - They're persecuted enough.

1053
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,760
谁迫害他们啦?她偷东西！ - 是啊，那又怎么样?我们还经得起偷
Who's persecuting? She stole! - So? We can afford it.

1054
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,040
我们怎么经得起偷啦?以你的薪水? 要是她越偷越多怎么办?
How can we afford it, on your pay? What if she steals more?

1055
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:42,080
她是个从哈莱姆区来的黑人妇女 她没有钱！
She's a colored woman from Harlem. She has no money.

1056
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,920
她有权偷我们的东西！ 毕竟要是她不偷我们，她还能去偷谁嘛！
She has a right to steal from us. Who can she steal from if not from us?

1057
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,520
你们俩都疯了！ - 他们听不见你说的，麦克斯
You're both crazy. - They can't hear you.

1058
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,160
列奥，我嫁给了个傻瓜！
Leo, I married a fool!

1059
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,000
咳，麦克斯，那是什么?
What's that?

1060
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:58,280
那是1945年欢迎我的表兄 赫比回家的聚会
That's the welcome home party, 1945, for my cousin Herbie.

1061
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,200
瞧那儿，那边那个 那是乔伊·尼克尔斯
Look. That over there is Joey Nichols.

1062
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,800
他是我父亲的朋友 当我还是小孩时，他总是来烦我
He was my father's friend. He was always bothering me when I was a kid.

1063
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,720
乔伊·尼克尔斯 看到没有?镍扣！
Joey Nichols. See? Nickels.

1064
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,920
看到没有?镍扣！ 你瞧，五分镍币！
See? Nickels. You see? Nickels.

1065
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,840
你可以一直记住我的名字 只要想起乔伊·五分镍币
You can always remember my name. Just think of Joey Five-Cents.

1066
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,720
那就是我，乔伊·五分镍币！
That's me. Joey Five-Cents.

1067
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,320
真是个混蛋啊！
What an asshole.

1068
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,600
最让我好笑的是我母亲的姐姐，泰茜
The one who killed me the most was my mother's sister, Tessie.

1069
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:29,200
我一直是几个姐妹当中最有见识的
I was always the sister with good common sense...

1070
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,840
而泰茜一直是最有个性的
but Tessie was always the one with personality.

1071
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,800
在她年轻的时候 他们都想和泰茜结婚
When she was younger, they all wanted to marry Tessie.

1072
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,520
你相信吗，麦克斯? 泰茜·莫斯科维茨有个性?
Do you believe Tessie had the personality?

1073
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,320
她是犹太人区受到关注的人物，毫无疑问 - 她从前可是个大美人
She's the life of the ghetto no doubt. - She was once a great beauty.

1074
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,160
泰茜，他们说你是姐妹中最有个性的
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.

1075
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,720
我以前是个大美人！
I was a great beauty!

1076
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,640
这样的个性是如何形成的呀? - 我很有魅力
How did this personality come about? - I was very charming.

1077
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,800
有许多男人对你有兴趣吗?
There were many men interested in you?

1078
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,520
噢，我会跳非常活泼的舞蹈
I was quite a lively dancer.

1079
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,480
这真的很难相信
It's very hard to believe.

1080
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:03,600
嗯，我今天玩得很开心，你知道吗? 这真是个很好的方式度过我的生日，
I had a really good day. It was a fine way to spend my birthday.

1081
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:06,680
啊，你的生日是在明天  - 是的，但是已经够近了
- Your birthday isn't until tomorrow. - But it's real close.

1082
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,000
- 是的，但是午夜前你得不到礼物 - 噢，见鬼
But no presents until midnight.

1083
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,460
这是…嗯?

1084
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:13,920
生日快乐！
Happy birthday.

1085
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
这是什么?这是礼物吗? 你开玩笑吧?
What is this? Is this a present? Are you kidding?

1086
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,680
是啊，咳，你为什么不试着穿上?
Yeah. Why don't you try it on?

1087
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:24,080
这更像是送给你的礼物，是的，但是… - 试试，它可使我们的性生活延长十年
This is more like a present for you. - It'll add ten years to our sex life.

1088
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,000
啊哈，是啊，别做梦了
Yeah. Forget it.

1089
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,600
这才是真正的礼物
Here's a real present.

1090
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:32,040
- 噢，是吗?这又是什么?让我看看 - 打开看看
- What is this anyway?    - Check it out.

1091
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:39,600
噢，天哪！你知道我想要这个 天哪，太棒了！天哪！
You knew I wanted this. God, it's terrific!

1092
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,440
那就戴上手表，还有那玩意儿 那就完美了
Just put on the watch and that thing. It'll be perfect.

01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,120
你唱得很有感染力
You were sensational.

1120
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:18,560
我是说，你知道，我跟你说过 如果你坚持下去，你会成功的…
I told you if you stuck to it, you would be great and-

1121
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,680
你知道，你唱得非常具有感染力
You were sensational.

1122
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,960
噢，是啊，艾尔维 我是说他们都是很棒的观众
Yeah, they were a terrific audience.

1123
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,480
我是说，你知道，那让我真的很放松 因为我可以…呃?
It makes it easy for me, because I can be-

1124
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:30,920
- 抱歉打扰了，嗨，我是托尼·雷西 - 噢，你好！
Excuse me. Hi, I'm Tony Lacey.

1125
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:35,520
- 我们只是想过来说一下，我们真的非常 欣赏你的表演  - 是吗?真的吗?噢！
- We wanted to say we enjoyed your set. - Yeah? Really?

1126
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,440
我认为唱的很有乐感，我非常喜欢
I thought it was very musical. I liked it a lot.

1127
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,560
那真太好了，天哪，非常感谢！
That's really nice. Thanks a lot.

1128
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:44,520
你…你灌唱片吗?你有签约吗?
Are you recording? Are you with any label?

1129
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,720
我?没有，还没有
Me? No, not at all.

1130
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,840
那么如果你有时间的话 我想找个机会跟你谈谈这个
I'd like to talk to you about that sometime if you get a chance.

1131
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,880
或许可以进行合作
Possibly working together.

1132
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:59,600
噢，那太好了，噢，对了，这是艾尔维·辛格 你认识艾尔维吗?这是托尼·雷西
That's nice. This is Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy?

1133
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:03,720
不，我不认识，但是我知道你的作品 我非常喜欢你的表演
I don't, but I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.

1134
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:07,800
- 非常感谢，认识你很高兴 - 这位是肖恩，还有鲍勃和佩特罗尼娅
This is Shawn, Bob and Petronia.

1135
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,240
我们要回"皮埃尔饭店" 我们住在"皮埃尔饭店"
We're going back to the Pierre...

1136
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:16,240
我们要去见杰克(尼克尔森)和安杰丽卡(休斯顿) 大家一起喝一杯
and we're going to meet Jack and Angelica for a drink.

1137
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:19,280
如果你们愿意加入，我们非常欢迎
If you'd like to come, we'd love to have you.

1138
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:22,840
我们可以一起坐下来聊聊 没什么，没什么大事
We can sit and talk. Not a big deal.

1139
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,680
只是放松一下，会很醇熟的
Just relax, be very mellow.

1140
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,840
记不记得我们还有那事儿?
Remember we had that thing?

1141
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,400
什么事?
What thing?

1142
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,880
你不记得我们讨论过的那件事? 我们在…
Remember we discussed that thing?

1143
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,560
- 那件事? - 对，我们讨…

1144
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:40,040
噢，那件事！噢，那件事…对…对
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing. Yeah.

1145
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:44,280
噢，那么如果你们不方便 不能去，那也没事儿
Well, if it's inconvenient, that's fine, too.

1146
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:48,800
我们换个时间再谈，或许你们会去西海岸(洛杉矶)，我们可以在那儿相见聚一聚
We'll do it another time. If you're on the coast, we'll get together there.

1147
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,360
- 你唱得真不错，我真的很欣赏 - 噢，天哪，
It was a wonderful set. I really enjoyed it.

1148
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,600
- 很高兴遇见你们，晚安！ - 再见，再见！
Nice to have met you. Good night.

1149
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,520
你怎么了? 你想参加他们的聚会?
What's the matter? You want to go to that party?

1150
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,760
我不知道，我想或许会很好玩
I don't know. I thought it might be fun.

1151
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,600
你知道我的意思 结识些新朋友也不错啊
It would be nice to meet some new people.

1152
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:13,080
我想我过不了一个醇熟的夜晚，因为我对醇熟的反应不怎么好，你知道
I don't think I could take a mellow evening. I don't respond well to mellow.

1153
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:16,640
如果我太醇熟了 那我会因为太熟了而烂掉的
If I get too mellow, I ripen and rot.

1154
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:19,400
- 你知道，那对我不… - 行了，行了，
- It's not good for my- - All right.

1155
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,440
你不想去参加聚会 那么你想干点什么呢?
You don't want to go to the party. What do you want to do?

1156
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,120
<i>(《悲伤和怜悯》)
犹太战争狂人和巴黎的大财阀们</i>

1157
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:29,920
<i>企图裹挟着他们的金银财宝逃走</i>

1158
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:33,360
那天的布鲁克林之行是我所记得的 最后一天真正快乐的时光
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember having a good time.

1159
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:37,240
- 我们之间再也没有了欢笑，这就是问题 - 我情绪不稳，经常闷闷不乐
- We never have any laughs anymore. - I've been moody and dissatisfied.

1160
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:40,240
你们经常睡在一起吗? - 你们经常做爱吗?
How often do you sleep together? - Do you have sex often?

1161
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,560
几乎很少，可能一周三次吧
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.

1162
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:46,600
非常频繁！我要说一周有三次 可是好像隔个一夜，艾尔维就想要
Constantly. I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted sex.

1163
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,880
她过了一夜就不愿意再和我睡在一起了
She would not sleep with me the other night.

1164
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,920
不知道，要是六个月前我可能还会顺着他，只是为了让他高兴
I don't know. Six months ago I would have done it just to please him.

1165
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,880
我试了各种办法，你知道
I tried everything.

1166
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:58,280
我放上轻柔的音乐，还有我的红灯泡
I put on soft music and my red light bulb.

1167
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:03,440
有意思的是…我是说自从来和你交谈以后 我觉得我应该对自己的感情负责
Since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings.

1168
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:06,720
我想你可能会感到高兴 因为我现在变得有主见了
I think you would have been happy, because I really asserted myself.

1169
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,160
最让人难以置信的是 我付钱让她去看心理医生
The incredible thing is, I'm paying for her analysis...

1170
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,920
她进展顺利 而我却快完蛋了
she's making progress, and I'm getting screwed.

1171
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:16,120
但是我不知道，我是说我深感内疚 因为是艾尔维出的钱让我来看的
I feel so guilty, because Alvy is paying for it.

1172
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,400
所以说我真的会很内疚 要是我不和他睡在一起的话
So I feel guilty if I don't sleep with him.

1173
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,480
但是如果我和他睡在一起 那又好像是违背了我自己的感情
But if I do sleep with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings.

1174
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:26,000
她有了进展，可我没任何进展 - 我不知道，我不可能赢
I'm not making any progress.  - I can't win.

1175
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,340
有时我会想我还不如干脆找个女的住在一起
Sometimes I think I should live with a woman

1176
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:32,520
哇噢，我不相信！ 你是说你们两个从没吸过可卡因?
I don't believe it. You guys have never snorted coke?

1177
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:36,600
嗯，我一直想试试，你知道 但是艾尔维总是强烈反对
I always wanted to try, but Alvy's very down on it.

1178
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:40,160
别怪我好吧！我可不愿意 把一大包白粉填进我的鼻子
Don't put it on me. I don't want to put a wad of white powder in my nose.

1179
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,080
因为鼻子里有粘膜
There's the nasal membrane.

1180
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,600
你从不想尝试新鲜的东西，艾尔维 - 你怎么能这样说?
You never want to try anything new. - How can you say that?

1181
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:50,280
我有一次提出，你、我、还有你表演班上的那个女孩，我们三个睡在一起
I said you, I and that girl from acting class should sleep together.

1182
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:53,200
- 那太恶心了！ - 我知道那很恶心，但那很新鲜
- That's sick. - I know it's sick, but it's new.

1183
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,840
- 你可没说新鲜的东西不会令人恶心 - 快过来试试，艾尔维！
- You didn't say it couldn't be sick. - Come on, Alvy.

1184
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,600
让你的身体来爽一把，试试，快过来！ - 是的，快，会很有趣的
Do your body a favor. Try it. - It'll be fun.

1185
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:03,800
我确信那很有趣，因为印加人吸那东西 百万印加人灰飞烟灭，都成了笑话
I'm sure it's fun, 'cause the Incas did it. They were a million laughs.

1186
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,480
艾尔维，快点！给你自己增加点体验 你不是想写作吗，为什么不试试?
For your own experience. You want to write. Why not?

1187
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,080
这货很棒，艾尔维，我的一个朋友 才从加利福尼亚搞回来的
It's great stuff, Alvy. A friend just brought it in from California.

1188
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,000
噢，你们知道吗…我还没告诉你们 我们下星期去加利福尼亚
I didn't tell you. We're going to California next week.

1189
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,160
让我感到特兴奋，你可以想象，(反话)
It's really a thrill, as you know.

1190
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,760
我听从了我经纪人的建议，我了结了这里的一切，准备去那儿上电视上露露脸
On my agent's advice, I sold out and am going to do a TV appearance.

1191
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:23,040
不，根本不是这么回事 艾尔维是去颁奖，在电视上
That's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on TV.

1192
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,440
天哪，你这样说好像 那是件见不得人的事似的
You act like you're violating a moral issue.

1193
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,480
那太诈唬了，而且我们还得在圣诞期间离开纽约，这最让我受不了了
It's so phony. We have to leave New York during Christmas. It kills me.

1194
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:34,920
艾尔维，你听着，你到加利福尼亚后有没有可能给我搞些可卡因带回来?
Listen, while you're in California, could you score some coke for me?

1195
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:39,920
当然，当然，乐意效劳，我只要把我的鞋后跟掏空，放在里面就行了
Sure, be glad to. I'll just put it in the hollow heel on my boot.

1196
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:44,280
这玩意多少钱? - 大概2000美元一盎司
How much is this stuff? - About $2,000 an ounce.

1197
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,800
真的吗?到底有什么过瘾的? 因为我从没…
Really? And what is the kick of it?

1198
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,920
<i>祝你圣诞快乐</i>

1199
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,880
<i>祝你圣诞快乐</i>

1200
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:57,580
<i>祝你圣诞快乐、新年幸福</i>

1201
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:00,600
在我搬到这儿来之前 从来没有这样放松过，麦克斯
I've never been so relaxed as I have been since I moved out here.

1202
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:05,080
我要让你看看我的房子，我住在休·海弗纳 (《花花公子》老板)隔壁，
麦克斯他允许我用他的水流按摩浴缸
I want you to see my house. I live next to Hugh Hefner.

1203
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:09,080
还有女人，麦克斯，她们都和《花花公子》女郎一样，所不同的是她们的手脚都会动
And the women are like in Playboy, but they can move their arms and legs.

1204
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:12,680
我无法相信这真的是贝弗莉山庄吗
I can't get over that this is really Beverly Hills.

1205
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,640
是啊，这儿的建筑风格可真够一致的哈? 法国式挨着西班牙式
The architecture is really consistent. There's French next to Spanish

1206
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:18,160
西班牙式挨着都铎(英国)式 都铎式挨着日本式
next to Tudor next to Japanese.

1207
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,080
天哪，这儿真干净！
It's so clean out here.

1208
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:23,760
那是因为这里的人不扔垃圾 他们把垃圾都整到电视节目里了
Because they don't throw garbage away. They make it into TV shows.

1209
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:28,200
得了吧，麦克斯！现在是圣诞节 - 你们能相信这儿像过圣诞节吗?
- Give us a break. It's Christmas. - Can you believe this is Christmas?

1210
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,960
- 你知道，纽约刚下过雪自然是白茫茫一片的  - 真的吗?
It was snowing and really gray in New York.

1211
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,400
太好了，是的 圣诞老人要被晒得中暑了
Nice. Santa Claus will have sun stroke.

1212
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,680
麦克斯，这儿没有犯罪，没有抢劫
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.

1213
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,200
这里没有经济上的犯罪，你知道
There's no economic crime...

1214
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:43,120
但是这里有各种典礼 还有宗教式的膜拜，这些都够谋杀人的
but there's ritual, religious cult murders.

1215
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,840
这里还有麦芽杀手
There's wheat-germ killers out here.

1216
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,440
既然你们已经在这儿了 我想带你去看看我的电视节目
While you're out here, I want you to see my TV show.

1217
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,960
还有，我们受邀参加 一个大型的圣诞聚会
And we're invited to a big Christmas party.

1218
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,280
<i>铭记基督是我们的救世主圣诞是他的出生日</i>

1219
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:00,720
<i>他会拯救我们于撒旦的魔掌 当我们误入迷途时</i>

1220
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:03,960
瞧这儿，查理，这里给我一个大笑声
Charlie, give me a good laugh here.

1221
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,720
<i>跟踪的豪华轿车抛锚啦?</i>

1222
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,040
再大点！
A little bigger.

1223
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,320
麦克斯，你没意识到这有多不道德吗?
Do you realize how immoral this all is?

1224
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,440
麦克斯，我的这个系列很热门的
I've got a hit series.

1225
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,880
是的，我知道 但你这是在加进去假的笑声啊
But you're adding fake laughs.

1226
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,280
给我一个很大的笑声，查理
Give me a tremendous laugh here.

1227
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,360
我们这是在观众面前的现场表演
We do the show live in front of an audience.

1228
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,560
是的，可是没人笑啊 因为你的笑话一点也不可笑
But nobody laughs, because the jokes aren't funny.

1229
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,080
对啊，所以说这机器作用不凡哪
That's why this machine is dynamite.

1230
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,960
<i>你最好躺下来 你在阳光下晒了太长时间了</i>

1231
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,000
这里给我点适中的咯咯笑声
Give me a medium chuckle here...

1232
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,480
接着是热烈的掌声
and then a big hand.

1233
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,760
这机子上有嘘声没?
Is there booing on that?

1234
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,520
<i>噢，麦克斯，我感到不太舒服 - 我们正打算撮合你和我表妹德洛丽丝呢</i>
I don't feel well.

1235
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,960
你怎么了? - 我不知道，我只是感到很晕
What's the matter? - I got very dizzy.

1236
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,240
我感到头晕，麦克斯 - 那你坐下， 
I feel dizzy. - Sit down.

1237
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:49,680
噢，上帝！
Jesus.

1238
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,540
你感觉怎样? - 我不知道，我是说…
You all right? 

1239
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,400
你想躺下吗? - 不，我一上午都感到有点反胃，只是现在
You want to lie down? No. My stomach felt queasy all morning.

1240
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,440
要不要喝点姜汁汽水?
How about a ginger ale?

1241
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,120
噢，麦克斯，不，也许我最好躺下
No. Maybe I'd better lie down.

1242
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,800
你为什么不试着吃点这个? 这只是鸡肉
Try to get some of this down. It's just plain chicken.

1243
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,240
不，我吃不下这个，我感到恶心
No, I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.

1244
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:15,000
你能不能给我点什么药 好让我熬过下面两个小时
If you could get me something to get me through the next two hours.

1245
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:18,800
因为我必须赶去伯班克(洛杉矶郊县) 给一个电视节目颁奖
I have to go to Burbank and give out an award on a TV show.

1246
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,400
但是实际上你没有什么不对劲的 至少我看不出来
There's nothing wrong with you as far as I can tell.

1247
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,560
我是说，你没有发烧 也没有任何严重的症状
You have no fever, no symptoms of anything serious.

1248
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,600
你没有吃过猪肉或者海鲜 - 对不起，抱歉，医生
You haven't eaten pork or shellfish. - Excuse me. I'm sorry, Doctor.

1249
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:32,520
艾尔维，我给节目组打了电话 他们说现在没事了，他们找了个替换的人
Alvy, that was the show. Everything is fine. They found a replacement.

1250
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,640
所以他们不用你来录带子了
They're going to tape without you.

1251
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,840
噢，天哪，那么我上不了电视啦?
Jesus! Now I don't get to do the TV show?

1252
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:38,760
- 是的，我说，医生，我很担心… - 天哪！

1253
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,560
我刚才说了，我找不出他这样子的理由 - 一切都正常吗?
I can't find any reason for this. - Nothing at all?

1254
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,280
- 是啊，但是我想我可以叫个化验员过来 - 麻烦你把盐递给我
- I could get a lab man up here. - Hand me the salt, please.

1255
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:49,440
好的，等一下，或许我们送他上医院 住上一两天可能会更好一些
Perhaps it would be better if we took him to the hospital.

1256
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,440
上医院?
The hospital?

1257
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:54,840
否则的话没办法确诊他 - 话说回来，这鸡味道还真不赖
There's no other way to diagnose him. - This is not bad, actually.

1258
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:02,360
咳，别跟我说我们得下车走到那屋子里
Don't tell me we're going to have to walk from the car to the house?

1259
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:05,320
天哪，我来洛杉矶后 我的双脚还没挨过人行道呢
My feet haven't touched pavement since I reached Los Angeles.

1260
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:09,040
那么，你和他见一面 如果你去见弗雷迪的话，那么我就去见你
I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.

1261
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,280
我见过弗雷迪了 弗雷迪见过查理
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie.

1262
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:14,280
- 你见见他吧 - 该见的面都要见
- You take a meeting with him. - All the good meetings are taken.

1263
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,840
现在只是一种想法
Right now it's only a notion.

1264
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:20,600
我想我可以弄到钱使它变成一种概念 然后再将它转变成一种思想
I think I can get money to make it into a concept, then turn it into an idea.

1265
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,520
喜欢这房子吗，麦克斯?
Like this house, Max?

1266
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,040
我甚至带来张地图好领着我们去卫生间
Even wrote a road map to get us to the bathroom.

1267
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,360
你应该告诉我 这是托尼·雷西的社交聚会
You should have told me it was Tony Lacey's party.

1268
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,800
有什么不一样吗?
What difference does that make?

1269
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,720
我想他对安妮有点意思，
I think he has a thing for Annie.

1270
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,600
不，不，可惜的是，麦克斯 他和那边的那位姑娘在一起  - 哪一个?
No. He goes with that girl over there. - Where?

1271
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,560
- 那个有"见裤线"的 - "见裤线"?
- The one with the VPL. - VPL?

1272
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:40,520
看得见内裤线 麦克斯，她太漂亮了
Visible panty line. She's gorgeous.

1273
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,680
是啊，她得十分，对你来说太重要了 因为你老是找只有两分的，不是吗?
She's a ten. That's great for you, 'cause you're used to two's, aren't you?

1274
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:44,880
没找过只有两分的，麦克斯
There are no two's.

1275
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,770
你习惯于那种手里拎着购物袋 脸上戴着医生用的大口罩
You're used to the kind with shopping bags walking through Central Park...

1276
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,440
嘴里嘟嘟囔囔地走过中央公园的姑娘
with the surgical masks on, muttering.

1277
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:53,170
你认为这一对怎么样，麦克斯? 像是他们才从马思特斯和约翰逊(性医学家)那里回来
How do you like this couple? They look like they're from Masters and Johnson.

1278
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:57,160
是啊，重症特护病房 噢，我的上帝！我想她正…
Intensive care ward. My God!

1279
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:01,080
- 我想她正朝我这边看 - 要是她过来的话，麦克斯，我的脑瓜子会变成鳄梨酱的
- I think she's giving me the eye. - If she comes over, my brain will mush.

1280
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:02,260
我来应付，交给我来应付，嗨！

1281
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,920
你是艾尔维·辛格吗? 我们是不是在"埃哈德研讨训练班"(心理治疗的cult组织)碰过面?
You're Alvy Singer, right? Didn't we meet at EST?

1282
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,800
"埃哈德研讨训练班"? 不，不，我从没参加过
No, I was never to EST.

1283
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,800
那你怎么能瞎批评它呢? - 他没说什么
Then how can you criticize it? - He didn't say anything.

1284
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:13,960
我没批评，我来这儿是为了做什么 电击疗法，可惜遇上了能源危机
I came to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis.

1285
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,720
他是我的食物品尝员，你们俩见过面吗? - 嗨，你好！
He's my food taster. Have you two met? - How do you do?

1286
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:19,720
你是品尝食物看看是否下了毒? - 是啊，他疯了
Do you taste for poisoned food? - Yeah, he's great.

1287
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,120
嗨，你们两个都穿白色服装 这一定是在明星的节目里
You guys are wearing white. It must be in the stars.

1288
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,920
- 说不准尤里·盖勒(特异功能表演者)也在这屋子里的某个地方  - 我要和他一起表演
- Uri Geller must be on the premises. - We're going to operate together.

1289
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,760
我们只要六个星期，大约六周后 我们就能灌完整张专辑
In about six weeks we could cut the whole album.

1290
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,160
我不知道，这对我来说很新鲜 我不知道
I don't know. This is strange to me.

1291
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:36,120
你可以来住在这儿 房子的整个这一侧你都可以用
You can stay here. Use the whole wing in this house.

1292
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:39,200
- 噢，住在这儿?啊哈? - 真的，你为什么要笑?
- Stay here? - Really. Why are you smiling?

1293
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:40,620
我不知道，我不知道

1294
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:44,040
他不仅是个伟大的经纪人 他还召集很好的会面
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good leading.

1295
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:48,400
这是套很棒的房子，真的，应有尽有 桑拿、水流按摩浴缸、三个网球场
This is a great house: saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts.

1296
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:52,560
你们知道谁是最初的房主吗?先是尼尔森·埃迪(歌星影星)然后是雷格斯·戴蒙德乐队
You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy then Legs Diamond.

1297
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,840
- 你们猜猜谁还在这儿住过? - 给点提示
- Then you know who lived here? - Trigger.

1298
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:00,120
查理·卓别林，在他因"非美国化" 而被拒绝回国之前
Charlie Chaplin, right before his un-American thing.

1299
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:04,640
你们两个仍然住在纽约 - 是啊，我喜欢那里
But you guys are still New Yorkers. - Yeah, I love it there.

1300
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:09,520
我也在纽约住过，我在那儿住了几年 你知道，但是现在好像变得特别脏
I used to live there for years, but it's so dirty now.

1301
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,680
我对垃圾很感兴趣，情有独衷 - 这间放映室真的很不错，很不错的房间
I'm into garbage. It's my thing. - This is a nice screening room.

1302
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,880
关于纽约还有一点
There's another thing about New York.

1303
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,000
你瞧，如果你想看电影 你不得不去排长队
If you want to see a movie, you have to stand on line.

1304
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,360
天气可能冻得要死 或下着大雨，可这儿…
It could be freezing or raining. And here-

1305
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,800
我们昨晚在这里看的《大幻影》
We saw Grand lllusion here last night.

1306
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,720
如果你吸点这个再看，更会觉得是部 伟大的电影，真的很有意思
That's a great film if you're high. It's really funny.

1307
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,920
过来看看卧室 那里面也布置得很棒
Come and see our bedroom. We did a fantastic thing up there.

1308
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
我还好，不用
I'm cool.

1309
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,920
真太妙了 你知道他们整天边吃东西边看电影
It's wonderful. They eat and watch movies all day.

1310
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,280
是啊，然后你就这样逐渐地老死 你知道有的时候努力一下也是很重要的
And gradually you get old and die. It's important to make an effort sometimes.

1311
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,600
- 你认为他女朋友漂亮吗? - 是的，她很好看
- Do you think his girlfriend's pretty? - She's great looking.

1312
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,920
有点中性化的风格，但是非常出众
A little on the androgynous side.

1313
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,840
是的，我忘了做颂祷
I forgot my mantra.

1314
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,920
玩得真愉快
That was fun.

1315
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
我一点也不认为加利福尼亚有什么不好
I don't think California is bad at all.

1316
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,280
回家反而让我感到乏味
It's a drag coming home.

1317
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:15,240
那么多漂亮女人 和她们调调情也很有趣
A lot of beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.

1318
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,360
我必须面对事实
I have to face facts.

1319
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:21,880
我喜欢艾尔维，但是我们的关系 看起来走入了死路
I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.

1320
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:25,520
我和安妮今晚在床上又要有 以往一样的麻烦了
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight.

1321
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,440
为什么我还需要这个关系?
Why do I need this?

1322
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:32,240
但愿我有足够的勇气提出分手 但是那样真的会很伤害他
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.

1323
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,720
但愿我不会感到内疚 如果我让安妮搬出去的话
If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out.

1324
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,000
那可能会令她伤心欲绝 但是我必须跟她坦白
It'd probably wreck her, but I should be honest.

1325
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,680
艾尔维，让我们面对现实吧
Alvy, let's face it.

1326
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:45,360
你知道，我不认为我们的关系会有出路
I don't think our relationship is working.

1327
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,320
我知道，这种关系我认为就像一条鲨鱼
I know. A relationship is like a shark:

1328
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,560
它必须不停地往前游 否则的话就会死掉
It has to constantly move forward or it dies.

1329
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,400
我认为在我们手里的 是一条已经死掉了的鲨鱼
And I think what we've got on our hands is a dead shark.

1330
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,280
这本《麦田里的守望者》是谁的? - 让我看一下，如果有我名字在上面
Whose Catcher in the Rye is this? - If it has my name on it...

1331
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,280
那么我猜是我的
I guess it's mine.

1332
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:05,880
当然有，你知道你在我所有的书上都写上 你的名字，因为你早料到这一天迟早会来
You wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day would come.

1333
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:09,280
唉，艾尔维 你想分手的愿望和我的一样强烈吧
You wanted to break up just as much as I do.

1334
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:13,120
我没问题，我认为我们这样做 是成熟的表现，毫无疑问
No question. I think we're doing the mature thing.

1335
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,400
听着，所有有关死亡的书都是你的
Look. All the books on death and dying are yours.

1336
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,800
所有有关诗歌的书都是我的
And all the poetry books are mine.

1337
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:22,000
这本《拒绝死亡》，你还记得吗? 这是我给你买的第一本书
Denial of Death. This is the first book I got you.

1338
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,080
噢，上帝，是的 - 还记得那天吗?
Remember that day?

1339
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,160
天哪，我感到我背后的负担减轻了好多
I feel like there's a great weight off my back.

1340
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:28,960
多谢了，亲爱的
Thanks, honey.

1341
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:35,320
噢，不，不，我的意思是，你知道，我是说发展新的关系等等的对我们两个都很重要
I mean, no. I think it's important for us to explore new relationships.

1342
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:40,360
对此我没有异议，因为我们这样做绝对是打开天窗说亮话，你知道
There's no question about that, because we've given this a more than fair shot.

1343
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,480
是啊，我的心理医生认为 这样做对我很关键
My analyst thinks this move is key for me.

1344
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:46,720
是啊，你知道，我相信她 因为她是我的心理医生推荐的
And I trust her, because my analyst recommended her.

1345
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,760
不管怎么说，为什么我要让你来忍受 我的不良情绪和焦虑不安呢?
Why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?

1346
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:53,200
是的，你知道我们这样分手的好处吗? 我们还有机会破镜重圆的
You know what the beauty part is? We can always come back together again.

1347
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,360
- 没问题的 - 正是，正是
- There's no problem. - Exactly.

1348
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:59,880
要知道，我认为许多男女处理不好这个 你知道，他们分手后保持不了朋友关系
I don't think many couples could handle this, break up and remain friends.

1349
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,520
咳，这个是我的，这颗徽章，还记得吗?
This button is mine. Remember?

1350
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:06,160
我想这些都是你的 "弹劾艾森豪威尔"、"弹劾尼克松"
These are yours. "Impeach Eisenhower. " "Impeach Nixon. "

1351
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:09,720
"弹劾林登·约翰逊" "弹劾罗纳德·里根"
"Impeach Lyndon Johnson. " "Impeach Ronald Reagan. "

1352
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,480
我想念安妮，我犯了一个可怕的错误
I miss Annie. I made a terrible mistake.

1353
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,480
她现在住在洛杉矶 和托尼·雷西在一起
She's living in Los Angeles with Tony Lacey.

1354
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:21,040
要是这样，那么就让她见鬼去吧！如果她喜欢那样的生活方式，那就让她呆在那里好了！
If she is, then the hell with her. If she likes that lifestyle, let her stay.

1355
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,760
- 我要说的是，托尼是个混蛋 - 他从哈佛毕业的，
- He's a jerk for one thing. - He graduated Harvard.

1356
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,960
是的，他…听着，哈佛也会犯错 你知道，基辛格在那儿教过书
Harvard makes mistakes, too. Kissinger taught there.

1357
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,800
别跟我说你这不是嫉妒?
Don't tell me you're jealous?

1358
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,000
是的，嫉妒，是有一点就像美狄亚 (希腊神话，因丈夫不忠而杀了他们的子女)
Yeah. Jealous? A little bit. Like Medea.

1359
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,560
让我给你看点东西，夫人 这个是我在她的房间里找到的
Can I show you something? I found this in the apartment.

1360
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:41,200
黑肥皂，她以前用黑肥皂一天洗八百次脸
Black soap. She used to wash her face 800 times a day with black soap.

1361
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,160
不要问我为什么
Don't ask me why.

1362
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,640
你为什么不和其他女人约会呢?
Why don't you go out with other women?

1363
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:48,880
嗯，我试过 可是，你知道，结果总是很沮丧
I tried, but it's very depressing.

1364
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,670
我老是对付不了这个 快点，去拿把扫帚来！
This always happens to me. Quick! Get a broom!

1365
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,840
你为什么要弄得这样大惊小怪的?
What are you making such a big deal about?

1366
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,760
它们只是龙虾啊
They're only lobsters.

1367
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,670
你是大人了，你知道该怎样抓龙虾 - 自从我戒烟以后，我就不太正常了
You're adult. You can pick up lobsters. - I'm not myself since I quit smoking.

1368
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:03,870
- 噢，那你什么时候戒的烟? - 十六年前
- When did you quit? - Sixteen years ago.

1369
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:07,480
- 你什么意思? - 意思?
- What do you mean? - Mean?

1370
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:11,440
你十六年前就停止吸烟了 你是这样说的吗?
You stopped smoking 16 years ago. Is that what you said?

1371
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,720
我不明白
I don't understand.

1372
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,480
你是开玩笑还是什么?
Are you joking or what?

1373
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,200
中央公园开始变绿了
Central Park's turning green.

1374
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:34,960
我又看见那个我们以前常见的 头顶风车帽
I saw that lunatic we used to see with the pinwheel hat...

1375
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,320
脚蹬旱冰鞋的疯子了
and the roller-skates.

1376
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,680
听着，我想你回到这儿来
Listen, I want you to come back here.

1377
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:44,320
那好，那我就去你那里接你回来
Well, then I'm going to come out there and get you.

1378
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,480
你什么意思，我在哪儿? 你以为我在哪儿?
What do you mean, where am I? Where do you think I am?

1379
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:54,520
我在洛山矶机场，我飞过来了
I'm at the Los Angeles airport. I flew in.

1380
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:57,320
我飞过来见你
I flew in to see you.

1381
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:00,480
听着，我们能不能不在电话上争吵
Can we not debate this on the telephone...

1382
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,280
因为我感觉我的体温又升高了
because I've got a temperature...

1383
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:07,440
还有我的慢性洛衫矶恶心症又犯了 我感觉不好
and I'm getting my chronic Los Angeles nausea again.

1384
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,840
不管你想在哪儿见面，我不在乎
Wherever you want to meet. I don't care.

1385
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:12,040
我会开车过去，我租了辆车
I'll drive in. I rented a car.

1386
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,760
我会开车，你什么意思?
I'm driving.

1387
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,360
难道有什么大不了的吗? 我自己开车过去
What, is that such a miracle? I'm driving myself.

1388
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,960
我要一份苜蓿苗
I'm going to have the alfalfa sprouts...

1389
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:39,560
再来一盘酵母菌糊
and a plate of mashed yeast.

1390
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:59,880
你看上去很漂亮
You look pretty.

1391
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:03,440
噢，不，我只是减了点体重，仅此而已
No, I just lost a little weight, that's all.

1392
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:10,440
那么，你看上去也不错
Well, you look nice.

1393
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:14,160
我在考虑我们应该结婚了
I think we should get married.

1394
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,640
噢，艾尔维，算了吧
Come on.

1395
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:21,760
怎么?你想一直住在这儿? 就像住在矮人国里一样
Why, you want to live out here? It's like living in Munchkinland.

1396
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,360
你什么意思? 这儿一切都很好
What do you mean? It's perfectly fine out here.

1397
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,360
托尼人很好
Tony's very nice.

1398
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,920
我结识朋友，参加聚会，还打网球
I meet people, go to parties and play tennis.

1399
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,600
那是我迈出的很大的一步，你知道
That's a very big step for me.

1400
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:37,640
我是说我能够和人们更好地相处了
I'm able to enjoy people more.

1401
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:40,560
你什么…你不想回纽约吗?
You're not going to come back to New York?

1402
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:44,440
纽约究竟有什么好?那是座濒临死亡的城市，你读过《威尼斯之死》
What's so great about New York? It's a dying city. You read Death in Venice.

1403
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,720
咳，要是我没给你买《威尼斯之死》 你也不会看
You didn't read Death in Venice until I bought it for you.

1404
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:51,040
是的，是的 你只给我买标题带有"死亡"的书
That's right. You only gave me books with the word "death" in the title.

1405
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,360
是的，因为这是个重要的问题
Because it's an important issue.

1406
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:56,320
艾尔维，你无法享受生活，你知道吗?
You're incapable of enjoying life. You know that?

1407
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,640
我是说，你就像是纽约市 你是这样的人
You're like New York City. You're just this person.

1408
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:01,280
你把自己封闭起来，像个小岛
You're like this island unto yourself.

1409
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:04,320
我无法享受什么，除非人人都能那样
I can't enjoy anything unless everybody is.

1410
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:09,000
你知道，要是哪里有人正在挨饿 那么我晚上就会睡不好觉
If one guy is starving someplace, it puts a crimp in my evening.

1411
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:13,280
那么你到底想不想结婚嘛?
Do you want to get married?

1412
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:17,280
不，我们只是朋友
No. We're friends.

1413
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,400
我想保持朋友关系
I want to remain friends.

1414
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,760
好吧，请拿帐单来，能把…
Check please.

1415
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,240
你很生气，是吗?
You're mad, aren't you?

1416
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,520
是的，我当然很生气 因为你爱我，我知道的
Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me. I know that.

1417
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,080
艾尔维，就我现阶段的生活而言 我不认为那是事实
I can't say that that's true at this point in my life.

1418
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,760
我真的不认为那是事实
I really can't say that's true.

1419
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:37,640
我想说你知道你自己有多出色
You know how wonderful you are.

1420
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:41,400
是你鼓励我走出我的房间 给我勇气去唱歌
You're the reason I got out of my room, that I was able to sing...

1421
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:45,560
让我了解了自己的感情 诸如此类的等等…
and get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap.

1422
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,920
听着，听着，嗯…
Listen, listen.

1423
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,000
那么你又在忙什么呢?
So what are you up to?

1424
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:57,360
还是和往常一样，试着写点东西 我正在写一个舞台剧
The usual. I'm trying to write. I'm working on a play.

1425
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:01,800
那么你是说你不愿意跟我回纽约?
Are you saying you're not coming back to New York with me?

1426
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:06,960
不！你看，我得走了
No. Look. I gotta go.

1427
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:10,320
- 你什么意思嘛?我飞了三千英里来看你 - 我要迟到了
What do you mean? I flew 3,000 miles to see you.

1428
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:13,040
是航空英里，你知道 在飞机上我的胃有多难受吗?
Air miles. Do you know what that does to my stomach?

1429
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:15,040
你应该知道托尼正忙得要死
If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony.

1430
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,000
今晚就是格莱美奖 - 是什么?
The Grammys are tonight. - The what?

1431
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,120

The Grammys. He's got a lot of records up for awards.

1432
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,800
哦，是吗?他们给那样的音乐还颁奖? 我恨不得把耳朵塞住
They give awards for that music? I thought just ear plugs.

1433
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:25,200
我们还是忘了吧，艾尔维，行吗? 让我们忘了刚才的谈话吧
Just forget it. Let's just forget the conversation.

1434
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,320
颁奖！他们不干别的，只会颁奖！ 我简直不敢相信！
They do nothing but give out awards. I can't believe it.

1435
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,800
最佳法西斯独裁奖：阿道夫·希特勒！
Greatest Fascist Dictator: Adolph Hitler.

1436
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:03,120
我知道你会说什么 我的车开得不太好
I know what you're going to say. I'm not a great driver.

1437
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:06,240
你知道，我有点麻烦… - 请出示你的驾照！
I have some problems with- - May I see your license, please?

1438
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,800
只是别生气
Just don't get angry.

1439
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:12,840
我的驾照在这儿 这辆车是租来的
I have my license here. It's a rented car.

1440
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:17,680
别跟我絮叨你这一辈子的故…事
Don't give me your life's story.

1441
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,880
把驾照捡起来
Just pick up the license.

1442
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:23,720
噢，"把驾照捡起来"，你应该好好地说 因为我今天过得太糟糕了，我女朋友…
You have to ask nicely, because I've had a rough day. My girlfriend-

1443
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,480
能不能请你就把驾照交给我呢?
Just give me the license, please.

1444
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,520
既然你这样说 那我就很难拒绝了
Since you put it that way, it's hard for me to refuse.

1445
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:33,520
我和长官一向不怎么对劲，你知道
I have a terrific problem with authority.

1446
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,680
这不是你的原因 我不是针对你个人的
It's not your fault. Don't take it personal.

1447
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,240
再见，伙计们，保持联系
So long, fellows. Keep in touch.

1448
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:59,040
可以想象我接到你的电话有多吃惊吗，麦克斯?
Imagine my surprise when I got your call.

1449
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:02,200
是啊，我感觉到了我打得不是时候
Yeah. I had the feeling I got you at a bad moment.

1450
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,480
因为我在电话里听到了尖叫声
I heard high-pitched squealing.

1451
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,960
一对孪生姐妹，麦克斯
Twins, Max.

1452
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,800
才十六岁
Sixteen-year-olds.

1453
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:13,800
你能想象数学上出现这种事的几率吗?
Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities of that?

1454
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:17,240
你是个演员，麦克斯 你应该在中央公园里表演莎士比亚
You're an actor. You should be doing Shakespeare in the park.

1455
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:20,520
噢，我在中央公园里演过莎士比亚 麦克斯，可是我被抢了
I did Shakespeare in the park. I got mugged.

1456
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:25,080
我在演《理查二世》，有两个穿 皮夹克的家伙，偷走了我的紧身连衣戏裤
I was playing Richard ll. Two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.

1457
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:32,360
麦克斯，我们这是要驾车 穿越钚元素放射区吗?
Are we driving through plutonium?

1458
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:36,200
防止阿尔法射线的，麦克斯 那样你就不会变老了
Keeps out the alpha rays. You don't get old.

1459
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:41,120
你应该是一个会思考的人， 你怎么能选择这样的生活方式?
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?

1460
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,840
纽约到底有什么特别了不起的地方?
What is so great about New York?

1461
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:47,000
那是座濒临死亡的城市 你读过《威尼斯之死》
It's a dying city. You read Death in Venice.

1462
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,360
是我给你《威尼斯之死》之后 你才读的
You didn't read Death in Venice until I gave it to you.

1463
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,680
你只给我看标题带有"死亡"的书
You only give me books with the word "death" in the title.

1464
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:55,480
- 这是个重要的问题 - 你完全无法享受生活
- It's an important issue. - You're incapable of enjoying life.

1465
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:58,520
你就像是纽约，你是座孤岛
You're like New York. You're an island.

1466
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:02,040
那好吧，如果我们所经历的一切 对你而言仅此而已
Okay. If that's all that we've been through together means to you...

1467
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,640
那我想我们最好还是就此别过 永不再见
it's better if we just said good-bye, once and for all.

1468
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:06,760
你不觉得这有点可笑吗?
It's funny.

1469
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:09,520
经历了那么多认真的讨论和 激情的时刻之后
After all the serious talks and passionate moments...

1470
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:13,640
一切都在这里结束了 在日落大道上的一家健康食品餐馆里
that it ends here, in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard.

1471
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,720
再见，萨莉
Good-bye, Sally.

1472
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:20,320
等等！我想跟你一起走
Wait. I'm going to go with you.

1473
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,280
我爱你
I love you.

1474
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,320
你想怎么样?这是我的第一部戏
What do you want? It was my first play.

1475
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,400
你知道人们总是试图 通过艺术来表达完美
You know how you're always trying to get things to come out perfect in art

1476
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:34,520
因为真实的生活比较难缠
because it's real difficult in life.

1477
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,920
有趣的是，我的确又遇见过安妮
Interestingly, however, I did run into Annie again.

1478
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
那是在曼哈顿的西北区
It was on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.

1479
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:44,640
她搬回纽约来了 和某个人一起住在搜活区
She had moved back to New York. She was living in Soho with some guy.

1480
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:48,640
我碰见她时 她正拽着他去看《悲伤和怜悯》呢
When I met her, she was dragging him in to see The Sorrow and the Pity

1481
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:51,080
这个我可以算成是我个人的胜迹
which I counted as a personal triumph.

1482
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,920
那以后的某一天 安妮和我一起吃了中餐
Annie and I had lunch sometime after that...

1483
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,840
回忆着我们往昔的时光
and just kicked around old times.

1484
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,880
<i>将我的双臂</i>
Just to have my arms

1485
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:05,800
<i>与你相拥</i>
Around you

1486
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:12,680
<i>依然令我心动</i>
Still the thrill

1487
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:16,400
<i>在那一天</i>
That it was the day

1488
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,680
<i>我发现你</i>
I found you

1489
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:22,680
<i>仿佛</i>
Seems like

1490
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:29,400
<i>旧时</i>
Old times

1491
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:37,080
<i>相约晚餐鲜花束束</i>
Dinner dates and flowers

1492
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,760
<i>旧时</i>
Old times

1493
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,880
之后，天有点晚了，我们都得回去了
After that, it got late and we both had to go.

1494
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:48,040
再一次见到安妮，我真的很高兴
But it was great seeing Annie again.

1495
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:50,760
我意识到她是一个多么好的人
I realize what a terrific person she was...

1496
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,560
能认识她就是一件多么有趣的事情
and how much fun it was just knowing her.

1497
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:57,160
我想起了那个老的笑话，你知道
And I thought of that old joke.

1498
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:01,840
有个家伙去看精神病医生 他说："大夫，我兄弟疯了"
This guy goes to a psychiatrist and says, "Doc, my brother's crazy.

1499
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:04,400
他以为他自己是一只鸡
He thinks he's a chicken. "

1500
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,680
医生说："那你怎么不把他带来?"
The doctor says, "Why don't you turn him in?"

1501
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:09,680
那家伙说："我是想带他来着 可是我需要鸡蛋啊"
The guy says, "I would, but I need the eggs. "

1502
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:14,120
你看，我想这就是现在 我对男女之间关系的感觉
Well, I guess that's, now, how I feel about relationships.

1503
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:19,040
你知道，它是完全非理性的 疯狂的、甚至荒谬的
They're totally irrational, crazy and absurd.

1504
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,960
但是我想我们还一直要经历这一切
But I guess we keep going through it...

1505
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:25,880
因为我们大多数人都需要鸡蛋
because most of us need the eggs.

	反对什么 安装风力涡轮机吗\N
	What? The wind turbines?
	和这些人打了六个月的交道\N
	6 months dealing with these people,
	好不容易都同意了\N
	they were all for it.
	大家都认为这对地区有好处\N
	Everyone agreed it was great for the region.
	那出什么岔子了\N
	So what happened?
	现在他们都觉得涡轮机\N
	Now they've decided that they don't like the way
	放在山上的样子不好看\N
	that it looks on that hill.
	他们说那样有碍观瞻\N
	It's "Ruining their view."
	这件事不是都定下来了吗\N
	I thought it was a done deal.
	是啊 当时都说定了\N
	It was! It practically was.
	那他们怎么还能这么做\N
	Can they do that?
	当然 他们就这么做了 这事儿完了\N
	Of course! They've done it, and it's over.
	抱歉\N
	I'm sorry.
	没事 我只是太沮丧了\N
	No, no, it's so frustrating.
	我忍不下去了\N
	I can't take it anymore.
	我要接海米尔那活了\N

	别 你不想为他们工作\N
	No, you do not wanna work for them.
	- 为什么  - 为政府工作吗\N
	- Why not?  - For the government?
	我觉得这届政府和以往不同\N
	I think this government is different.
	我们需要法律支持 这是唯一的办法\N
	We need laws and it's the only way anything is gonna happen.
	总有别的法子的\N
	That's not the only way,
	你们已经做了很多不错的工作了\N
	you guys have been getting a lot of good work done.
	我考虑过了 只有这办法行得通\N
	Well, I've been thinking about it, this is the way to go.
	好吧 那你可别忘了\N
	Ok, well then let me remind you
	你和那人合不来\N
	that you do not like that guy.
	以前你在他那工作的时候\N
	The whole time you worked for him before
	你整天都在抱怨\N
	you complained about him constantly.
	没错 他是个混蛋\N
	Yeah, yeah, yeah... He can be an asshole
	但是他能帮我把事搞定\N
	but he gets things done.
	从现在开始我就得这么想了\N
	That's how I'm gonna be from now on.
	- 好吧  - 我要做个贱人\N
	- Ok.  - A real bitch, Ok?
	每次我见他都觉得他是狼子野心\N
	Well, every time I look at that guy all I see is ambition.
	对不起 我就是不信任他\N
	I mean, I'm sorry, I don't trust him.
	他从非营利部门转入政府的唯一原因\N
	The only reason he's going from not for profit to government
	就是想有人能拍他马屁\N
	is to have people kiss his ass.
	我不在乎他怎么样 好吗\N
	I don't care about him, Ok?
	好吧 我就是觉得你会过得特痛苦\N
	Ok, I think you are gonna be miserable.
	面对数不清的政治活动和协商会议\N
	With all the politicking and compromise.
	无所谓\N
	Whatever.
	我已经决定了\N
	I've made my decision.
	典出
	古希腊神话{\u0}中诸神对西西弗斯的惩罚，让他每每接近成功又前功尽弃\N{\rCHS}我不想再做把大石头推上山\N{\rENG}I'm tired of being the do-gooder who rolls a boulder up a hill
	再看着它滚下来的老好人了\N
	and watches it roll down again.
	他以前不是经常\N
	Wasn't he the guy who used to throw his pens
	扔笔砸他的助理吗\N
	at his assistants and stuff?
	我一年前就该接这份工作了\N
	Ok, I should have taken this job a year ago.
	我害怕是因为工作量太大\N
	And I was scared because of the amount of work
	但是我觉得这是个绝好的机会\N
	but I think it's the best opportunity ever.
	工资也更高 我决定了\N
	And it's more money, and I'm doing it.
	好吧 你确定吗\N
	Ok, are you sure?
	不确定 我什么都不确定 行吗\N
	No, I'm not sure of anything, Ok?
	如果我走了 那其他人都怎么办\N
	I mean, what's gonna happen to everyone if I leave?
	弗朗索瓦他们都指着我呢\N
	Like Francois... I mean, they count on me.
	你觉得呢\N
	What do you think?
	我该不该接那个工作\N
	Should I take it or not?
	不 不 我不发表意见\N
	Oh, no no no, I don't have an opinion.
	我只是不想你因为风力涡轮机的失败\N
	No, I just don't want to see you rush into a decision
	就匆忙做出决定\N
	because this wind turbine crap is gone.
	不仅是因为那个 好吗\N
	It's not just that, Ok?
	我都蠢蠢欲动一整个夏天了\N
	It's been stirring me all summer.
	- 不 我知道的  - 我要接这个工作 我决定了\N
	- No, I know it has, I know.  - I should do it. I'm doing it!
	那就接吧\N
	Then do it.
	我决定了 好吗\N
	I'm doing it! Alright?
	上帝啊 我真希望事情都能简单些\N
	Oh God, I wish that things were simpler.
	我走也完蛋 我留也完蛋\N
	I mean... if I leave I get fucked, if I stay I get fucked.
	永远都不确定\N
	It's always a guess.
	没错 这就是个操蛋的世界\N
	Yeah, the world is fucked.
	我觉得也是\N
	Yeah, maybe.
	天啊 好不容易能度个假期了\N
	Oh God, we finally have a vacation,
	头两个星期姑娘们还生病了\N
	and the girls are sick for the first two weeks.
	我明白\N
	I know.
	有个完美儿子 却还住在一百万英里外\N
	With the perfect son who lives a million miles away.
	或者是你毕生所爱\N
	Or the love of your life
	刮完胡子不知道清理下\N
	who can't clean up after himself
	还不肯学学怎么刮胡子\N
	or learn how to shave.
	谁说的\N
	Who said that?
	你不是在说这的清洁队队长吧\N
	You're not talking about Captain Clean-up over here?
	清洁队队长\N
	Captain Clean-up?
	那个在行动中都失踪了好几年的人\N
	The one that's been missing in action all these years.
	这时候你希望我说什么\N
	What did you expect at this point?
	上帝啊\N
	God.
	瞧瞧她们 太可爱了\N
	Oh look at them, they're so cute.
	就像连体婴儿似的\N
	They look like conjoined twins.
	天啊 我得给她们照张相\N
	Oh my God, I'm gonna take a picture of this.
	艾拉那个苹果吃完了吗\N
	Hey, did Ella finish that apple?
	你要从孩子嘴里抢食吃吗\N
	You're going to take food out of your child's mouth?
	- 是的  - 好吧\N
	- Yeah.  - Ok.
	都变成棕色了\N
	This all brown.
	没关系 还有一块可以吃\N
	No no, there is a spot here.
	艾拉 这是你爸爸偷你食物的证据\N
	Ella, this is evidence of your father stealing food from you.
	不管你变得贪食还是厌食\N
	If you become bulimic or anorexic,
	都不是我的错 别全怪你妈妈 好吗\N
	it's not my fault, don't blame it all on your mother, Ok?
	艾拉 这是个家庭分享苹果\N
	Ella, this is a family apple.
	我在教她们分享的重要性\N
	I'm teaching them the value of sharing.
	宝贝我爱你\N
	I love you, honey.
	多甜蜜啊 姑娘们会比咱们还要深刻地\N
	Ahhh, so sweet, you girls will remember this vacation
	铭记着这次与众不同的假期\N
	very different than we will.
	那是肯定的\N
	That's for sure.
	从我妈那里我就知道了\N
	I see that with my mom,
	她对我童年的印象和我完全不同\N
	she remembers my childhood entirely different than I do.
	别拍我了\N
	Please stop filming me.
	天啊 我爱你妈妈 你对她太苛刻了\N
	God. I love your mom, you're always so hard on her.
	因为你错过了那些操蛋的岁月\N
	It is because you missed the fucked-up years,
	你赶上了好时候\N
	you are just getting the good era.
	操蛋的岁月\N
	The fucked-up years.
	说到操蛋我想起来了\N
	That reminds me, talking about fucked-up,
	我告诉过你我那只艳后猫咪的事吗\N
	did I ever tell you the story about my little Cleopatra kitty?
	我记不得了 我要是说过你肯定有印象\N
	I dunno? Ok. I think you would remember if I did.
	故事是这样的\N
	It's the story.
	我小时候养了只猫 起名叫埃及艳后\N
	You know when I was a little girl I had this cat named Cleopatra.
	每到春天她都会跳出栅栏然后怀孕\N
	And every spring she would jump the fence and get pregnant.
	每次都会生出恰好两只猫咪\N
	And always end up with a litter of exactly two kittens.
	- 恰好两只  - 每次 每年都是两只\N
	- Two kitties.  - Every time, every year, two cats.
	很神奇 在我三十岁左右的某一天\N
	I mean... it's just amazing, then one days I was like around 30.
	我和我爸爸一起吃午饭 回忆过去\N
	And I was having lunch with my dad and was remembering,
	提到了小埃及艳后\N
	mentioning little Cleopatra.
	他说自己做过最艰难的事\N
	And he was like... the hardest thing I ever had to do
	就是杀掉那些可爱的小猫咪\N
	was to kill those cute little kittens.
	我惊讶极了\N
	And I was like what?!
	我告诉你 其实就是这么回事\N
	It turns out ... listen to this.
	有时她会一窝生出七只猫咪\N
	There was sometimes up to 7 kittens in that litter.
	我爸爸就拿走五只\N
	But he would take 5 of them,
	把它们放进一个塑料袋 然后灌乙醚\N
	put them in a plastic bag, with a bunch of ether.
	太可怕了\N
	That is terrible.
	就好像 他似乎忘记了\N
	That was like... He had forgotten
	当初他和妈妈是怎么骗我的了\N
	the lie he and my mum had told me about the kittens.
	他怎么决定该杀哪几只呢\N
	How did he decide which ones he wanted to kill?
	其实我倒真问过他\N
	Well actually I asked him that.
	是不是拿走最毛茸茸的 最可爱的\N
	Did you take the, you know, the fluffiest, cutest?
	然后他就开始哭 可怜的老爸\N
	You know, and he just started to cry, poor daddy.
	咱们说过要在这里停车的\N
	Oh we said we would gonna stop.
	孩子们要看遗迹\N
	They wanted to see the ruins.
	- 没错  - 艾拉特想看\N
	- Yeah.  - Well, Ella really wanted to ...
	是的 但是咱们该把她们叫醒吗\N
	Yes, but should we wake them up?
	咱们回机场的路上可以叫她们看\N
	You know, on the way back to the airport, we can catch them.
	- 咱们不会的  - 没错 大概是\N
	- You know we won't.  - Yeah, probably not.
	再见了古代遗迹 不过你有什么好看的\N
	So long ancient ruins! What is so great about you, anyway?
	窥一斑可见全豹\N
	You seen one, you seen them all.
	天啊 咱们真是对糟糕的父母\N
	Oh my God, we are shitty parents.
	咱们应该停车的\N
	We should have stopped.
	- 没事的  - 这是文化 掉头吧\N
	- It's Ok.  - It's culture, come on, go back.
	咱们得培养她们一些品质\N
	We gotta put some character to these kids somehow.
	咱们在教她们重要的一课\N
	I mean, we are teaching them a valuable lesson.
	在这世上 如果你睡过了 就错过了\N
	If you snooze, you lose in this world.
	然后等姑娘们进了戒毒所\N
	And when the girls are in rehab suffering from
	遭受十年的吸毒成瘾时\N
	10 years of addiction to cocaine and speed.
	她们会说 我只是从来都睡不踏实\N
	They'll say, you just never felt comfortable going to sleep.
	因为我们爸爸总是告诉我们说\N
	Because our daddy always used to tell us
	睡过了就错过了\N
	that if you snooze, you lose.
	这就又是你的错了\N
	And that will be your fault, again.
	- 咱们真是糟糕的父母  - 我知道\N
	- Well we are shitty parents.  - I know.
	和汉克告别糟透了\N
	Saying goodbye to Hank sucked.
	为什么 他不高兴吗\N
	Why? Was he upset?
	没有 他说这是他过得最好的暑假\N
	No. He said it was the best summer of his life.
	那很好啊 我不会太担心他的\N
	Well that's great. I mean, I would not worry too much about him.
	我们聊了很多\N
	We spoke a bunch.
	你知道他这辈子最关心什么吗\N
	You know what his main concerns in life are?
	什么\N
	What?
	青春痘和女孩子们对他的感觉\N
	Pimples and how girls perceive him.
	真是有其父必有其子\N
	The apple doesn't fall far far from the tree I guess.
	我才不是那样呢\N
	I'm not like that.
	拜托 你脑子里只有这个\N
	Oh please! That's all you think about!
	- 什么啊  - 女人啊\N
	- What!  - Women!
	我不是在抱怨\N
	I mean... I'm not complaining.
	我占用了你大部分精力\N
	I'm getting a lot of attention.
	- 但你总是在向姑娘抛媚眼  - 我没有\N
	- But you never stop ogling girls.  - I don't ogle girls.
	我不送秋波 我用眼神传达爱意\N
	I don't ogle girls. I make love to them with my eyes.
	我喜欢这个西班牙人 她是不是希腊人\N
	Oh wow... I like the Spanish guy or is it Greek?
	我不知道我来自何方 但我体毛旺盛\N
	I do not know where I am from, but I'm very hairy.
	我觉得 亨利可能有点\N
	Well I think... you know... Henry might of...
	- 怎么了  - 那个叫梅丽娜的小姑娘\N
	- What?  - That little, Melina girl.
	我不知道 他心动了 但是\N
	I don't know. He had a crush, but...
	你开玩笑吧\N
	Are you kidding?
	你觉得他为什么说这是最好的一个暑假\N
	Why do you think he said it was the best summer of his life?
	因为我们一起度过了快乐的时光吗\N
	Because he and I had a good time together?
	上帝啊\N
	Jesus.
	- 所以呢 你觉得他们接吻了吗  - 当然了\N
	- So what? Do you think they kissed?  - Of course.
	没错 接吻了 是的\N
	Yeah, they kissed, yeah, yeah.
	我发誓要保密的\N
	I was sworn to secrecy
	但是他告诉我他们接吻了\N
	but he told me they kissed.
	他怎么说的\N
	What did he say?
	我不应该告诉你的\N
	I'm not supposed to tell you anything,
	我不说了\N
	so I'm not gonna talk.
	- 说吧  - 好吧\N
	- Come on!  - Ok!
	他告诉我他在琢磨接吻的事\N
	He told me he was concerned about the kissing.
	而且是舌吻\N
	You know tongue to tongue.
	是的\N
	Yeah.
	但是他太可爱了\N
	But he was... he was so cute,

	Like it's now or never, you know?
	我不懂 你什么意思\N
	No. what do you mean?
	我知道总有一天\N

	I mean, I really think it's time to tell his mom all this,
	问她愿不愿意让孩子跟我们一块住\N
	and ask if he can live with us.

	父亲就该教会儿子这些\N
	a father is supposed to teach you that.
	他只是不喜欢打棒球 不能怪他\N
	Ok. he just doesn't like baseball, you can't blame him.
	我只是用这个例子来比喻做其他事情\N
	It's just an example, it's a metaphor for everything.
	他马上就十四岁了 他需要父亲的陪伴\N
	He's turning 14 and he needs to be with his father.
	杰西 我是不会搬去芝加哥的\N

	我只是想到什么说什么\N
	I'm just thinking out loud.
	我曾经答应过自己不要这么冲动\N
	I mean, this is the one thing I promised myself I would never do.
	现在我看开了 冲动就冲动吧\N
	And I look up and I'm doing it!
	听着 你是个好父亲\N
	Listen, you're a wonderful father.
	他珍惜这段父子关系\N
	He loves the relationship you have,
	他珍惜你给他写的信\N
	he loves the letters you send him.
	我的信他连看都没看\N
	He doesn't even read the letters.
	他当然看了你的信\N
	Of course he reads them,
	他只是没有给你回…\N
	he just doesn't complement the writing the way you want...
	我只是知道 要是错过了这几年\N
	I just know that if I miss these years,
	就永远也补不回来了\N
	they are never coming back.
	老天\N
	Oh my God.
	怎么了\N
	What?
	这就是结束的时刻\N
	This is where it ends.
	你在说什么\N
	What are you talking about?
	- 这就是人们分手的节奏  - 老天\N
	- This is how people start breaking up.  - Oh my god.
	- 不是的  - 你这是小题大做\N
	- No, no, no.  - You just jumped off a cliff.
	不是 我要记下今天\N
	No, no. I'm marking this,
	就在今天 你引爆了\N
	this is the day you light the ticking bomb,
	了结我们性命的定时炸弹\N
	that will destroy our lives, yeah?
	好的 首先\N
	Ok, well, first off,
	不是引爆定时炸弹\N
	you don't light a ticking bomb,
	而是安装 它有定时器\N
	you set it, it has a timer.
	- 所以才能定时  - 是吗 管他呢\N
	- That's why it ticks.  - Oh, yeah. whatever.
	现在已经开始倒计时了\N
	You know what? It's ticking right now.
	说什么也没用\N
	And this is how it happens.
	你自己不高兴\N
	You are unhappy and blame it
	却怪别人满怀怨恨\N
	on the other person Resentment grows,
	等一切都崩溃了 你就提出分手\N
	everything falls apart and you break up.
	- 你就是这样  - 你这样做只是想让我闭嘴\N
	- That's it.  - You are just doing this to shut me up.
	不是 根本不是\N
	Not at all! Not at all!
	你是 而且你也这样做了\N
	No, you are, and that's what you are doing, yeah.
	不是 我是觉得很惊讶\N
	No, I'm actually surprised,
	在经历了那么多…\N
	we've lasted this long...
	好的 直接说你想说的\N
	Ok. So here it comes out...
	我们本形同陌路 但却萍水相逢\N
	We are on parallel tracks a while but now the tracks have crossed,
	现在却要分道扬镳了\N
	and I'm going west and you're going east.
	就是这样分手的\N
	And believe me this is how it happens.
	我早就知道了 就像卡特琳跟亚历山大…\N
	I've seen it, ok? Katrin, Alexandre...
	- 你在开玩笑吧  - 没有\N
	- You're kidding, right?  - Well, no.
	你可以当玩笑 但我是认真的\N
	I'm kidding, and I'm not.
	好吧\N
	Right.
	别那么…\N
	Just...
	- 就这样了  - 我想看古代遗迹\N
	- This is it.  - I want watch ancient ruins.

	No, the first is "This time",
	第二本叫《彼时此刻》\N
	and the second is "That time".
	没错\N
	Yeah.
	我们还开玩笑 第一本帮我们组建家庭\N
	We've got a joke in our family that "This" Brought us together,
	第二本帮我们还房贷\N
	and "That" Paid for our apartment.
	好吧\N
	Ok.
	但瑟琳的角色有点怪 伙计\N
	But it must be a little weird for Celine, man.
	她在书中的表现 不觉得吗\N
	The way that she's in the book. No?
	会吗 可能她已习以为常了\N
	Why? I think she has gotten used to it.
	第二本写得真香艳 伙计\N
	But the second one is sexy, man.
	男主角错过飞机后 他们就把窗户关上\N
	When he misses the plane and they blackout the windows,
	然后没日没夜地做爱\N

	You did that, huh?
	你看过杰西的第三本书没\N
	Have you read Jesse's third book?
	事实上比前两本写得好\N
	It's actually better than the first two.
	反正写的时间\N
	It certainly took longer
	比前两本加起来都要长\N
	to write than the first two put together.
	我没看第三本 我老婆给我了\N
	No, the third one I didn't read, I mean my wife gave it to me,
	但我觉得有点长\N
	but it's a just a little bit too long for me.
	连书名也很长 叫什么来着\N
	Even the title is long. What's the title?
	《长年上演的小众话剧\N
	"Temporary cast members of a long-running
	中的临时演员们》\N
	but little-seen production of a play called fleeting"
	我说得没错吧\N
	Well, exactly my point.
	不止是你 其他人也觉得它太长了\N
	You're not alone, everybody else thought it was too long.
	这本书写得更好 更有野心\N
	It is a better book, it's so much more ambitious.
	他说什么\N
	What was that?
	他说 三本书他都喜欢\N
	No, he says, he likes... he likes all the books.

	He does.
	我喜欢这里 这里棒极了\N
	I mean I love it here. This place is amazing,
	番茄也棒极了\N
	those tomatoes are so amazing.
	闻起来都觉得好吃 真好闻\N
	I can smell them, they smell so good.
	是的 帕特里克对此引以为豪\N
	Yeah. Patrick is very proud of them.
	我知道这样想很蠢 不过…\N
	I know it's stupid but...
	当决定离开巴黎到这来时\N
	When we were about to leave Paris,
	其实我很担心\N
	I was all nervous we were about to come here.
	现在要走了 却又舍不得\N
	And now we're about to leave and I do not wanna go.
	- 为什么会担心  - 是啊 为什么\N
	- Why were you nervous?  - Yes, why was that?
	我不知道 这地方承载着\N
	I do not know. this place is so full of
	千百年的悲欢离合\N
	thousands of years of myth and tragedies,
	我害怕有不好的事要发生\N
	and I thought something tragic was gonna happen.
	弥诺陶洛斯
	：古希腊神话中人身牛头怪物\N{\rCHS}你怕弥诺陶洛斯会来吃你的小孩\N{\rENG}You thought the Minotaur was going to eat your children.
	是的\N
	Yes.
	没错\N
	Exactly.
	这些天来 我有了一个想法\N
	All the time I've been here I've been working on this idea about
	是关于一群大脑异常的人\N
	a group of different people with all these brain abnormalities.
	我想从他们的独特视角出发\N
	So the book would be like a day in their life,
	来观察他们日常生活中的一天\N
	from all their unique points of view,
	就比如有位老太太\N
	Right? Like there's this older lady who has the condition that
	她会沉浸在似曾相识的感觉当中\N
	makes you feel like you're in a perpetual state of deja vu.
	每一个经历过的场景\N
	And every single experience she has,
	她都会觉得似曾相识\N
	she feels like she's had it before.
	她有可能坐在这\N
	I mean she could be sitting here with us
	很正常地跟我们聊天\N
	talking seemingly functional right?
	其实她脑子里在想\N
	And in her head she's thinking,
	这话他刚刚不是说过了吗\N
	didn't he already say that?
	会不会我们昨天也在这\N
	I mean, weren't we here yesterday?
	展开了一模一样的谈话\N
	Having this exact same conversation?
	就像有即视感\N
	So just like deja vu?
	是的 不过更频繁\N
	Yeah, except all the time.
	她所接触过的每一样事物\N
	That's the thing, right, everything she takes in.
	一份早餐 一张报纸 一场电影\N
	A breakfast, a newspaper, a movie.
	她都认为自己早就经历过\N
	She is convinced she's encountered it already.
	这种情况真的存在吗\N
	Is that a real condition?
	是的 叫做持续性即视…\N
	Yeah, it is called persistent Dejav...
	确实存在 我不会拼而已\N
	It's real but I can't pronounce it.
	接着是截然相反的两个人\N
	There are two other characters with facial recognition extremes.
	一个二十年来从来都认不出自己的老婆\N
	There is one guy and he can not recognize his wife for 20 years.
	他看着镜子中的自己\N
	He looks at himself in the mirror,
	会感到陌生\N
	and he feels disconnected with that man he's looking at.
	另一个角色则刚好相反\N
	And the other character is the opposite.
	这位中年主妇有着\N
	A middle-aged housewife with a categorical exacting memory
	对人过目不忘的本领\N
	of every face she has ever seen.
	虽在大城市 对她而言却与小城镇无异\N
	And she lives in a big city but to her it is a small town.
	就比如有辆计程车经过 她就会想\N
	Like a taxi drives past and she thinks,
	那不就是三年前的圣诞节\N
	"Oh that's the driver who dropped me off
	孚日广场
	：巴黎最古老的广场\N{\rCHS}在孚日广场放下我的司机吗\N{\rENG}at Place des Vosges three Christmases ago."
	就比如看见有位老太太走在街上\N
	Like some old lady, walking on the street,
	她就会想 她是去年在地铁上\N
	she thinks, "Oh! She sat two seats down from me
	坐在我后两位的老太太\N
	on the metro last year."
	所以她对遇见的每个人\N
	So everyone she meets, you know,
	都感到亲密无间\N
	to her feels intimate and connected.
	我喜欢你说的第一个\N
	Well, I'm like the first guy,
	因为大多时候我也是见人就忘\N
	I feel connected to nothing most of the time.
	阿奇里斯 安娜 你们好\N
	Hey! Achilleas! Anna! Hey guys.
	看这孩子 他暑假过得比我们都要好\N
	Look at this kid, he is having the best summer of us all.
	所以你要说的就是这三个角色 对吗\N
	So, you were saying these three characters, right?
	不 这只是那一群人当中的三个角色\N
	No. It's not just three characters, it's a whole group of people.
	我现在也有一章是写\N
	Like I'm working on a Chapter right now,
	一个叫阿奇里斯的年轻希腊男子\N
	about a young Greek man named Achilleas.
	- 我吗  - 是以你命名的\N
	- Me?  - Well, he's named after you.
	这个人陷入了迷阵\N
	And this guy is caught in a loop,
	在他看来一切都是转瞬即逝的\N
	all he sees is the transient nature of everything.
	就像他看到这片海\N
	Like he looks out to the sea, and he thinks of the day
	他想到的是它干涸和堆满化石的一天\N
	it's gonna be dry and littered with fossils.
	怎么说呢 听上去有点做作\N
	Well, I do not know. Sounds a little pretentious to me.
	不 不会做作 我保证\N
	No no no, it won't be pretentious, I promise, I promise.
	会很有趣 真的很有趣\N
	It's gonna be funny. Really funny.
	他捡到一本书马上想到的是\N
	He picks up a book and immediately wonders,
	最后读到这本书的人会是谁\N
	who's gonna be the last person to read this?
	- 这有趣吗  - 有时候我也会那样想\N
	- And that's funny?  - Sometimes I kind of think like that.
	所以他不喜欢乳房啊 车啊 饮酒啊\N
	Ok, so he does not get excited about
	对这些都不感兴趣\N
	tits, cars, booze, nothing?
	- 一心只想着死亡  - 也不全是死亡\N
	- Just thinks about death.  - Well, not so much death.
	像变了一个人似的\N
	It's like transformation, you know,
	对于未来过于杞人忧天\N
	like he is seeing too far in the future.
	- 好吧  - 我喜欢这个想法\N
	- Ok.  - I like this idea for a novel.
	不过你应该加个像我一样的老头上去\N
	But you should add a character of an old man like me.
	一个连早餐吃过什么都会忘的人\N
	A poor sapp who can't remember what he ate for breakfast,
	但对于十四岁那年在珠儿酒吧\N
	But still hear the song that was playing,
	希拉·坎贝尔
	：八十年代美国女影星\N{\rCHS}看到希拉·坎贝尔半裸跳舞时\N{\rENG}when Sheila Campbell danced topless
	所听到的音乐记忆犹新\N
	on the bar at Jurees when he was 14 years old.
	这提议很不错\N
	That would work.
	这些人都在时间里迷失了 对吧\N
	Ok. you have these people lost in time, right?
	他们之间的联系在哪 是通过做爱吗\N
	What is the connection? Are they gonna have sex?
	难道不需要把他们联系到一起吗\N
	Don't you need something like that?
	他们并非迷失在时间里 而是感知出了问题\N
	It's not time they have lost in, right? It's like, perception.
	这样说吧\N
	That's the deal,
	我打算把整部小说设置在一部电影当中\N
	I'm thinking of setting the whole novel at a movie.
	每个角色都会跟\N
	Like every character in some way
	《码头风云》
	：马龙白兰度主演的奥斯卡获奖影片\N{\rCHS}《码头风云》这部电影产生一定的联系\N{\rENG}comes into contact with the film "On the Waterfront".
	看过《码头风云》没\N
	Have you seen On the Waterfront?
	《码头风云》吗\N
	On the Waterfront?
	白兰度演的吗\N
	With Brando?
	书的第一章发生于一九五四年的一个周末\N
	The first chapter of the book is opening at a weekend
	在时代广场\N
	in Times Square in 1954.
	有着持续性即视感的老太太\N
	That old lady with perpetual deja vu
	走去看日场放映\N
	walks into the matinee screening,
	但她却满脑子疑惑\N
	except the whole time she's thinking,
	我不是已经看过了吗\N
	"Haven't I already seen this?"
	另外一章发生在一九七九年\N
	Yeah, and then in another chapter
	巴黎的一个电影学习班里\N
	is a 1979 Paris film studies class.
	接下来会发生在一九九三年\N
	Then we have a Kazan

	这讲的就是时间 怎么不是时间呢\N
	Well man, that is time. How is that not time?
	确实与时间有关 但讲的更多的是感知\N
	Yeah, it's time, but it's more perception.
	- 你不喜欢吗  - 我怕你又写很长\N
	- You don't like it?  - I think it's gonna be too long!

	在法国番茄跟辣椒\N
	In France we stuff the tomatoes with tomatoes,
	会酿上不同的馅\N
	and the peppers with peppers.
	真的吗 我们这都酿同一种馅\N
	Oh, really? Because we use the same stuffing for both.
	这样你就能尝到馅糅合香草的味道\N
	Because of the way it reacts with the leaves you can taste.
	好吧\N
	Ok.
	瑟琳 别酿太满\N
	Oh, and Celine, make sure you don't stuff them too much,
	不然待会馅溢出烤炉\N
	because of the way it overflows in the oven later.
	会比较难清洁\N
	It gets kind of nasty.
	你做的很好 瑟琳\N
	You're doing fine, Celine.
	千万要记住 别听斯特凡诺斯的\N
	And especially do not listen to Stefanos here.
	他没做过这道菜\N
	Because he has never made this dish before,
	实际上他就没做过菜\N
	or any other dish, for that matter.
	别拿着刀吵架\N
	Stop fighting with knives!
	别这样 别拿着刀吵架\N
	Stop it! Stop fighting with knives!
	我们没有吵架 我们是在商量\N
	We're not fighting, we are negotiating.
	商量 你们管这叫商量\N
	Negotiating. That's how you call it?
	哇 带着刀的商量啊\N
	Wow, négociation avec des couteaux!
	完全正确\N
	Exactement!
	这是我们相处的方式\N
	It is a system that we have.
	看来你们找到了适合你们的方式\N
	So you found the system that works for you.
	我想这就叫磨合\N
	I thought it was called having a "Relationship".
	不过我喜欢你们的说法 很棒\N
	But I like system, that's pretty good.
	- 这可以了吧  - 可以了\N
	- That's ready, right?  - That's ready.
	你呢 你的相处方式是什么\N
	Toi, c'est quoi ton system?
	- 我是这个  - 不错嘛\N

	特别是你 帕特里克\N
	And especially you, Patrick.
	这六周多亏有你的招待\N

	我也一样 谢谢你 帕特里克\N
	And I have to say the same, so thank you, Patrick!
	我不仅要敬你为我和我的家人所做的一切\N
	And not just for what you done for me and my family,
	还要敬你一直以来的慷慨奉献\N
	But for all the ways that you have given back, alright?
	敬帕特里克\N
	To Patrick!
	谢谢 谢谢\N
	Thank you, thank you, thank you,
	当我第一次在机场看见你\N
	you know when I first saw you at the airport.
	我心想 这男的穿成这样\N
	I thought, no way, a man dressed like that
	怎么可能是个作家\N
	could be a man of letters.
	但现在我总算找出原因了\N
	But now. I think I've learned your secret,
	在过去十年里也出现过许多优秀的作家\N
	we've had many great writers over the past decade,
	但没有一位的妻子比作家本身还要有意思\N
	but never one who had a partner more interesting than themselves.
	谁说不是呢\N
	I'm telling you.
	瑟琳 感谢你和你的女儿\N
	And Celine, it's been so great to
	为这里带来了无限的生机\N
	have you and your daughters' wonderful vitality around here.
	同时也很高兴能为你引见\N
	And I'm so happy you were able to meet
	我的好朋友娜塔莉\N
	my dear friend Natalia.
	她的丈夫伊莱亚斯跟我情同手足\N
	Whose husband Elias was like a brother to me.
	对上校的事我感到很抱歉\N
	I'm so sorry about the Colonel.
	- 我说的是上次…  - 是我的错\N
	- I mean the early...  - I should... It was my fault.
	我跟安娜也要感谢这次暑假邀约\N
	Thanks for including Anna and me this summer.
	因为他平常只会让我去工作\N
	Because you know he usually puts me to work.
	但我把安娜带来时\N
	But when I bring Anna,
	他让我坐在大人桌上\N
	he let me sit at the table of the grown-ups.
	欢迎来到大人桌\N
	Welcome to the grown-up's table!
	你们俩在一起多久了\N
	How long have you two been together?
	从上个暑假到现在\N
	Since last summer.
	我们一年前在这里邂逅\N
	We met one year ago here,
	那是在我要回雅典之前\N
	in my last days with Grandpa,
	陪伴爷爷的最后几天\N
	before I had to go back to Athens.
	是的 我们在闭幕晚会上相遇\N
	Yes, we met at my closing night cast party.
	那时候我在剧院演莎翁的戏\N
	I was doing Shakespeare in the theater.
	你演什么角色\N
	Who did you play?
	我演《冬天的故事》里的潘狄塔\N
	I was Perdita. The winter's tale.
	她演得很好\N
	She was fantastic.
	帕特里克 记得我们看的那次吗\N
	Remember, Patrick, we went to there?
	潘狄塔 当你跳舞时\N
	Perdita, "When you do dance,
	我希望你是浩淼海洋中的一道波浪\N
	I wish you a wave o' th' sea,
	这样就已足够\N
	that you might ever do Nothing but that."
	你演得\N
	The way you just performed,
	比剧中那小伙子好多了\N
	that was much better than the guy in the play.
	人们至今还对那部剧津津乐道\N
	People are still talking about that production.
	但更棒的在宴会后 那是我俩头次见面\N
	But the after-party was even better, it was when we met.
	对 我开着老款的BSA型摩托车\N
	Yeah, I had an old BSA motorcycle.
	不错\N
	Nice.
	整晚我们都在兜风\N
	So... we drove around all night,
	最后我们开回剧院\N
	and then I had to drive her back to the theater,
	去拿她的东西\N
	to get her stuff.
	那时天已经蒙蒙亮了\N
	And it was the dawn.
	我永远忘不了那一刻\N
	And I'll never forget it.
	那是个露天剧场 可容纳一万两千人\N
	It was outdoors and it seats 12000 people,
	空空荡荡的\N
	and it was now completely empty.
	她径直走到最后一排坐下\N
	And she was sitting way up in the back row.
	所以 我登上舞台\N
	So... I went up on stage
	低声对她说\N
	and whispered to her.
	声音的传播好奇妙\N
	The acoustics there are incredible.
	我先看到他的嘴在动\N
	I could see his mouth move and then 3 seconds later,
	三秒后我才听到他的声音\N
	I could hear his voice in my ear.
	他说的什么\N
	What did he say?
	- 好  - 好\N
	- OK!  - Right.
	小秘密\N
	It is private.
	然后她飞回巴黎住些日子\N
	And then she had to fly back to Paris a couple of days later.
	你们怎么联络呢\N
	How did you keep in touch?
	我们用视频聊天\N
	We Skyped.
	几乎天天聊\N
	Pretty much every day since then.
	我们睡觉时\N
	And we are in bed,
	必然会把电脑放在枕边\N
	we have a thing of putting our laptop by the pillow,
	看着对方一起入睡\N
	and... falling asleep together
	听着又新鲜又浪漫\N
	Oh that's the new romance.
	等醒来 屏幕基本都定格在\N
	And when I wake up the screen is usually frozen
	一些很滑稽的姿势 就像这样\N
	and Anna's face is in some funny position like...
	我来问个问题\N
	Can I ask you a question?
	你们视频聊天时\N
	When you guys Skype
	有点小疯狂的事情没有\N
	Do you, you know... do you go a little crazy?
	天 你的节操呢\N
	My God! You're being so vulgar!
	这无关什么节操\N
	No, nothing to vulgar.
	我是个对虚拟世界比较感性趣的\N
	I'm just being a amateur anthropologist
	只停留在理论水平的业余人类学家\N
	who is interested in the virtual world on a theoretical level.
	你倒成了人类学家了\N
	Now you're an anthropologist.
	没错 题目是未来的性爱\N
	Yes, the sex of the near future.
	我这不是胡扯\N
	And I'm not making this up but it's
	将来会在你的生殖器里放入个装置\N
	gonna be just like plugging in something in your genitals.
	冒犯了 可以根据你的需要\N
	I'm sorry. And you can have sexual intercourse
	来选择跟谁性交\N
	with anyone of your choice.
	专门为你定制\N
	You'll be able to programme in all your preferences.
	满足你的要求\N
	You'll be able to type in exactly what you want.
	比如让玛丽莲·梦露 在你耳边轻语\N
	Marilyn Monroe to whisper in your ear.
	听起来超赞 没错\N
	I might like that! Yes!
	为什么不呢\N
	I mean... Why not?
	越来越多的人们\N
	More and more of our
	把时间放到了虚拟世界上\N
	experiences are taking place in the virtual world.
	是的\N
	Yeah...
	你是作家 如果有一天电脑能写出\N
	And you're a writer. How are you gonna feel when
	比战争与和平还好的书 你会怎么想\N
	Computers can write a better book than 'War and Peace'
	不会有那一天的\N
	That will never happen.
	我想现在唯一的问题是什么时候会发生\N
	I think the only question is when it's going to happen.
	我想与卡斯特罗的感觉差不多\N
	I think I will probably feel about the same way as Kasparov
	记得吧\N
	you remember, all those
	所有那些棋手都不能战胜的\N
	chess players felt when they could no compete
	超级电脑\N
	with that big-ass computer...
	- 深蓝  - 对对 就是那个\N
	- The big blue.  - Right, right.
	最初大家都认为\N
	Remember at first thought
	电脑不能战胜人类\N
	nobody thought a computer could ever beat our best.
	机器没有人类那妙不可言的天资\N
	A machine lacks that ineffable human instinct.
	现在我们却输得一塌糊涂\N
	You know and now we can't even compete.
	我看过一篇文章\N
	I saw a documentary where
	上面说他们用小白鼠做了个实验\N
	they were doing an experiment on a lab rat.
	将它身上连了个开关\N
	And..he was wired up and
	打开开关它就能高潮\N
	could push a switch and have an orgasm,
	然后这个可怜的小家伙\N
	and so, the scientists were
	让科学家们一顿爆笑\N
	sort of laughing at this pathetic little creature.
	它不吃不喝 就不停的触摸开关\N
	While it ignores food and water and didn't do anything else.
	最后它就这么死了\N
	And eventually it just died.
	我觉得这就是\N
	I mean, I think that's the
	人类的未来 就像…\N
	future of humanity, you know? Just...
	爽到死\N
	and die!
	有可能吧\N
	Well, maybe so
	每代人都认为\N
	but every generation believes
	自己见证了世界末日\N
	that they're witnessing the end of the world.
	但\N
	But...
	看我 不还活得好好的\N
	I feel that I'm actually living it.
	好 我问个问题 帕特里克\N
	Ok I have a question for you Patrick.
	许多人都这样觉得\N
	I think a lot of people are feeling that way... you know
	人们都着迷于享乐\N
	We are like this kind of pleasure-obsessed
	腐蚀于性爱 不断追求物质\N
	porn-addled Materialist.
	将人性深埋于科技的土壤中\N
	Seeding our humanity to technology
	而这时 计算机正变得拥有感情\N
	At the same moment that computers are becoming sentient.
	对吧 所以我的问题是\N
	Right? So what my question is,
	这种自觉到底从何而来\N
	is this notion of 'self' to begin with.
	德尔斐阿波罗神庙门前\N
	Well it's written over
	刻着这么几个字\N
	the portals of the temple of Apollo at Delhi
	就是“Γνώθι σ' αυτόν”
	[希腊语]\N{\rENG}it says"Gnothi seauton"
	意思是“认识你自己”\N
	Which means "Know thyself"
	但现在基本全自动化了\N
	Yes but we are kind of 99% automated already.
	而性格这种属于自觉的东西\N
	No our personality or this thing we think of as ourselves.
	其实只占大脑运作的一小部分\N
	It is only a tiny fraction of what the brain is doing.
	身体绝大多数的机能又都是自行运转的\N
	Most of these automated body functions.
	那么自觉到底根植于何处呢\N
	So then is what is it we're actually seeding?
	这种自觉的概念\N
	Now, if this notion of self
	如果只占那么一丁点的话\N
	is such a small percentage of usage
	为何我总能听到关于它的话题呢\N
	How come I always hear so much about it?
	就像我的小鸡鸡\N
	Well it's just like my penis.
	不是说它有多大\N
	I mean it's not that big
	虽然只是身体的一小部分\N
	it is a small part of myself
	但需要很多关照\N
	But it needs a lot of attention.
	他的也是\N
	His too!
	你们是怎么认识的\N
	And how did you two meet?
	你不知道吗\N
	You do not know?
	怎么\N
	What?
	去读读杰西的书\N
	Well, you have to read Jesse's books.
	想知道跟我做爱什么感觉\N
	Yeah, especially if you want to know
	就去仔细读读 快去读读\N
	exactly what it is like to have sex with me, read away!
	赶快去读\N
	Read away!
	不好意思 斯特凡诺斯\N
	Excuse me, Stefanos.
	我意思是那肯定是本好书\N
	I mean it's well written.
	对\N
	Yeah
	我们十八年前相识\N
	We met about 18 years ago and we kind of,
	相互之间有一点感觉\N
	sort of fell in love a little bit.
	然后 我们失去了联系\N
	and... then we lost track of each other
	大概十年后 我们又遇见了\N
	And a decade later, we ran into each other.
	不 不是遇见 小笨熊\N
	No, no, no ... we did not run into each other, sweetie bear
	你写的那本书 灵感来自我们相遇\N
	You wrote a book inspired by our meeting...
	我读了之后 决定去找他\N
	And I read about it and went to look for him.
	好浪漫\N
	That's pretty romantic.
	没有 没有\N
	Not really, not really, not really.
	他没说他结婚了\N
	He neglects to mention that he was married,
	- 也没说有了孩子  - 那是细节\N
	- had a kid...  - Details! Details!
	想起来真是灾难\N
	Yeah that part was a disaster!
	谈不上吧 这没办法避免\N
	It wasn't a disaster, it was inevitable.
	第一次没有带套\N
	And the first time that we had sex without a condom.
	一下生了对双胞胎 我就被拖下水了\N
	Twins! And have been chained to the sink ever since...
	很遗憾\N
	Sorry to say that.
	没这么糟吧\N
	It's not that bad is it?
	你家闺女多漂亮\N
	The girls are so beautiful.
	又那么可爱\N
	They are cute.
	还是有好的方面 对吧\N
	Ok... no, no, it has some upsides.  Ok.
	让我教教你 安娜 怎样抓住男人的心\N
	Let me tell you right now, Anna, how to keep a man
	玩愚蠢的小游戏时 得处处让着他们\N
	You got to let them win at all the silly little games
	- 老天  - 他们喜欢\N
	- Oh God!  - they like...
	我们俩认识的第一晚 一起玩弹球\N
	When I met Jessy the first night we were playing pinball.
	- 当然是我赢了  - 你听到的\N
	- And of course I was winning.  - What you are hearing is the
	是我们俩恋爱关系里 最低级的谎言\N
	foundational lie to our entire relationship ...
	最后一刻\N
	And at the last minute I let the
	- 我让球这样从中间过去  - 不对\N
	- ball go down in the middle.  - It is... It is, no.
	- 这才能帮他们建立信心  - 玩什么都行\N
	- It builds their confidence,  - She can't beat me at one game,
	- 如果不让他们赢  - 不是所有游戏\N
	- if I didn't let him win it every game,  - not any game...
	我们就不能上床\N
	We would never have sex.
	我不得不说\N
	I mean... I'm sorry to say
	他是隐性大男子主义者\N
	all this but he's actually a closet macho.
	就想娶个胸大无脑的老婆\N
	He dreams of having a bimbo for a wife.
	- 那是我最大的梦想  - 做梦吧\N
	- It is my greatest aspiration.  - Dreams!
	那么\N
	So...
	怎么\N
	Yes?
	你是个作家吗\N
	So you're a writer?
	是呀\N
	Yeah, yeah... sure.
	那你写的是书吗\N
	So you write like... books?
	我只写了几本\N
	I've written a few, sure.
	人家以前从没遇到过作家\N
	Wow... I've never met a writer before.
	你肯定聪明极了\N
	You must be really smart.
	有时人家累了\N
	You know... I can't even
	甚至连自己的名字也写不好\N
	write my own name sometimes when I'm tired.
	你喜欢哪种书呢\N
	What kind of books do you like?
	人家喜欢故事里充满了\N
	Well I like stories with a meaning behind it,
	美丽的爱情\N
	like a really beautiful love story.

	Oh sure yes!
	我曾读过一本书叫《罗密欧和…\N
	You know... I read this book once... Romeo and...
	朱莉叶\N
	Juliet
	对呀\N
	Yeah!
	你也看过吗\N
	Wow! You know it?
	挺棒的 但其实那是出戏剧\N
	It's very good. It's a play, actually.
	那不是书 是戏剧\N
	It is not a book, a play.
	人家以为那本书是电影改编的呢\N
	Oh I thought it was a book based on the movie.
	- 不 是戏剧  - 原来是戏剧呀\N
	- No, no, a play  - Ok, it was a play, wow!
	其实人家没有读完\N
	Well, actually I did not read the whole thing
	因为人家\N
	because sometimes I have to
	有读杂志的习惯\N
	keep up and read these magazines
	好了解大家都在做什么\N
	To know exactly what's going on in all those peoples' lives.
	- 这很重要  - 你这么聪明\N
	- Well that is important.  - Ok you are very, very smart.
	我想你的下面也一定很厉害\N
	And I bet you have a gigantic penis.
	怎么我就这么爱这个女人\N
	Why am I finding myself so attracted to this woman?!
	这是男子主义有趣的一面\N
	And that's the funny part of it.
	而糟糕的一面是\N
	The not so funny part of the
	今天我们去机场送亨利\N
	closet macho, ok, is that today after we drop Henry off,
	之后他告诉我\N
	He tells me that
	即使我有一份非常理想的工作\N
	even though I have an offer for an amazing job,
	他还是想我放弃并跟他去芝加哥\N
	He wants me to throw it away and move to Chicago.
	我没这么说\N
	That's not what I said,
	- 我说我很想他  - 没错 这样我们\N

	男性与女性不同的特质\N
	masculine and feminine, right?
	准备好了吗\N
	Ok, ready?
	我妈妈曾经是名护士\N

	她说 每个女人醒来的第一件事\N
	She said  that every woman
	第一件 第一反应就是\N

	Would be to ask to ask about everyone else:
	我的孩子有事吗\N
	how are my kids?
	我的丈夫有事吗 有其他人受伤吗\N
	How is my husband? Is anyone else hurt?
	而男人们 无一例外\N
	Every man with no exception, when they
	当他们被这样告知 第一反应是什么呢\N
	were told all this, what was the first thing they did?
	低头看看自己老二\N

	老二 老二\N
	Penis! Penis!
	你们能从纯粹的性别角度解释\N
	But if you can explain it on strictly gender terms

	当我想起我的丈夫\N
	Well... when I think of my husband,
	我非常想念\N
	what I miss the most about him
	夜晚他躺在我身边的感觉\N
	is the way he used to lie down next to me at night.
	有时他会把胳膊横在我的胸前\N
	Sometimes his arm would stretch along my chest,
	我动不了 甚至要憋住呼吸\N
	and I could not move, I... I even held my breath.
	但我感到 安心\N
	But I felt safe
	完整\N
	Complete.
	我也想念\N
	And... I miss the way
	他走在街上吹着口哨的样子\N
	he was whistling walking down the street.
	每次做什么我都会想他怎么做\N
	And every time I do something I think of what he would say,
	天冷了 要披上围巾\N
	when it's cold today, wear a scarf.
	但是之后 我渐渐忘却细节\N
	But lately I've been forgetting little things.
	记忆在不断褪色 我开始忘记他\N
	It's sort of fading and I'm starting to forget him.
	这就像\N
	And it's like ...
	我又失去了他\N
	like losing him again.
	所以有时 我努力回想\N
	So sometimes I make myself remember
	他脸庞的每一处\N
	every detail of his face.
	眼睛的颜色 唇齿的样子\N
	The exact color of his eyes, his lips, his teeth,
	他的皮肤和头发的触感\N
	the texture of his skin, his hair.
	这一切记忆都随着时间流走了\N
	That was all gone by the time he went.
	但有时 偶尔 只是偶尔\N
	And sometimes... not always, but sometimes,
	我能非常清楚的看到他\N
	I can actually see him.
	就好像拨开云雾 他就在那里\N
	It's as if a cloud moves away and there he is.
	我几乎能碰到他\N
	And I could almost touch him.
	突然 真实回到了眼前\N
	But then... the real world rushes in.
	他再次消失了\N
	And he vanishes again.
	曾几何时 每天早晨\N
	For a while, I did this every morning,
	天刚亮的时候 我都会看到他\N
	when the sun was not too bright outside.
	可不知为何 他又会消失在阳光下\N
	But the sun somehow makes him vanish.
	他出现又消失\N
	And he appears and he disappears,
	像日出和日落\N
	like a sunrise and a sunset.
	一切都那么短暂\N
	Anything, so ephemeral.
	正如我们的生活\N
	It's just like our life.
	我们出现又消失\N
	We appear and we disappear.
	我们对有些人来说很重要\N
	And we are so important to some,
	可我们又只是擦肩而过\N
	but we are just... passing through.
	敬 擦肩而过\N
	To "passing through"
	敬 擦肩而过\N
	To "Passing through"
	终于 他在窗户的倒映下看清了自己的脸\N
	And eventually he catches his face in the window's reflection
	他意识到自己已不再是那个9岁的小男孩了\N
	And he realizes he's no longer a 9 year old boy.
	对吧 他突然之间变老了 有了胡子\N
	Right? He's suddenly old, he's got a beard
	- 眼睛里水雾缭绕  - 确实让人难过\N
	- and his eyes are watery  - This one seems sad
	开始我还以为你要给我讲故事\N
	At first I thought you were going to tell me a story
	就是关于一个人臆想出一个朋友的那个\N

	你二十岁时写给\N

	我不记得有这部分了\N
	No I did not even remember that part,
	我是想说那封信里还提到别的事情\N
	I meant to all the other things in that letter
	你还是那个你 我们总觉得自己会成长\N
	You're the same guy, I mean, we always think that we are evolving
	可我们并无力改变多少\N
	But we can not change that much
	- 你知道我是怎样看待我的变化的  - 怎样\N
	- You know how I think I've changed the most.  - How?
	我年轻的时候总希望时间可以过得快一点\N
	When I was younger I just wanted time to speed up.
	为什么\N
	Why?
	因为那样 我就可以做我自己\N
	So I can be on my own, so I can be free from my parents
	摆脱掉家长和学校的一切束缚\N
	and school and all that shit, you know,
	我希望自己闭上眼 一睁眼就变成了成年人\N
	I just wanted to close my eyes and wake up and be an adult
	现在一切都如我所愿成为现实\N
	And now I can feel that that happened
	我却希望时间能停下来\N
	and I want everything to slow down.
	很奇怪 在我的一生当中\N
	It's strange I've always had
	这种感觉始终挥之不去\N
	this feeling no matter where I am in my life.
	既像是真实存在 又仿佛南柯一梦\N
	That it's either a memory or a dream.
	我知道你一直有这种感觉\N
	I know you've always thought that.
	我也是 就好像 这真的是我的人生吗\N
	Me too, it's like is this really my life?
	现在这一切都正在发生吗\N
	Like is it happening, right now?
	- 就是这样  - 我知道\N
	- It is.  - I know!
	每一年 我都会感受到\N
	Every year I just seem to get
	更大的压力和打击\N
	a little bit more humbled and more overwhelmed
	那些事情我从来搞不明白\N
	about all things I'm never gonna know or understand
	这就是我一直在告诫你的\N
	That's what I keep telling you:
	你一无所知\N
	You know nothing.
	我知道 我已经醒悟了\N
	I know, I know! I'm coming around!
	其实 一无所知并没有你想象的那么糟糕\N
	But not knowing is not so bad.
	我是说\N
	I mean...
	关键是要不断发现 寻找\N
	The point is to be looking, searching,
	保持如饥似渴的状态\N
	to stay hungry, right?
	没错 我只是希望能变得简单一点\N
	That's true... I just wish it was a little easier.
	什么意思\N
	How do you mean?
	你知道的 就是保持一定的热情\N
	Just to maintain a certain level of passion, you know.
	所有的一切都那么顺理成章\N
	I mean, it used to come so naturally.
	记得我年轻的时候 我的一群作家朋友们\N
	Remember when I was younger, me and all my writer friends.
	我们可以感觉到自己在做的是重要的事情\N
	We like.. we just felt like were doing something important.
	你知道吗 就好像是属于我们的时代\N
	You know? Like this was our time.
	可他们都是些骄傲自大的小子 对吗\N
	But they were all a bunch of arrogant little pricks, right?
	不 好吧 也许吧 我也不知道\N
	No! Alright, maybe... I dunno...
	我们长大后就渐渐失去了\N
	we just grew out of all this energy,
	当初的热情 创造力和雄心壮志\N
	all this creativity or whatever ambitions people had.
	我觉得人还是应该年少轻狂些才好\N

	年轻人都是这样 不停地把自己和别人比较\N
	Young men have this thing about comparing themselves all the time.

	而斯科特 ·菲茨杰拉德三十岁才写出来\N
	F. Scott Fitzgerald did this by 30.
	巴尔扎克每天早餐前创作一部作品\N
	And Balzac wrote a book before breakfast everyday.
	是的 可是女人们并不这么想\N
	Yeah, but women do not think that way as much.
	你这么认为吗\N
	You don't think so?
	我们只是没什么可比的罢了\N
	We have much less to compare ourselves to, maybe.
	大多数有所成就的女人\N
	Most women who achieve anything in life.
	在你第一次听说她们时 都已经五十多岁了\N
	the first time you hear about them, they're in their 50s.
	因为在这以前 对女人来说\N

	想要得到一定的社会地位实在是太难了\N
	for them to get any recognitions before then.
	她们要么苦苦奋斗了三十年\N
	They struggled for 30 years
	要么就是在能做自己想做的事之前\N
	or they raised kids and were stranded at home
	都被困在家里 相夫教子\N
	before they could do what they want.
	你知道吗 这其实也算是一种解放\N
	Actually you know what? It's kind of freeing.

	好吧 好吧\N
	Ok, ok.
	天哪\N
	God!
	所以那是戈尔巴乔夫\N
	So was it Gorbachev?
	好吧 你知道的\N
	All right, you know.
	听着 我本来打算一会儿再跟你说\N
	Listen to this... I was going to wait
	可我这个人就是藏不住话\N
	to tell you this till later, but I'm so bad with secrets.
	怎么\N
	What?
	你脑子里长了肿瘤 快死了吗\N
	You've got a tumor in your brain and you are going to die?
	不 不是\N
	No, no.
	不是这些 好吗\N
	Nothing like that, alright?
	好吧 其实也有点像\N
	Well, actually, it's kind of like that.
	- 我祖母死了  - 不是吧 什么时候的事\N
	- My grandmother died.  - What! When?
	是的 我们吃饭前我爸爸发短信告诉我的\N
	Yes, my dad texted to me right before we ate.
	对不起 你怎么不早说\N
	Oh I'm so sorry. Why didn't you tell me?!
	像每个人都希望的那样\N
	Everyone has been expecting it.
	她活得够长了 而且一生幸福\N
	she has lived a long time, had a great life.
	她九十六岁了\N
	She was 96.
	你祖父死后没多久 她就去世了\N
	She did not live much longer after your grandfather died.
	不 有一年了\N
	No... barely a year...
	有趣的是 这女人还是个奇怪的圣人\N
	The funny thing is that this woman was a freaking saint, ok?
	战争时期 她做过护士 照顾我们所有人\N
	She was a nurse in the war. She took care of all of us.
	她从来没有说过别人一句坏话\N
	You know... she never said any unkind word about anybody.
	- 真希望我能遇到她  - 没关系的\N
	- I wish I had met her.  - It's OK.
	好吧 因为到后来\N
	Okay, because by the end, you know,
	她不想再认识任何人了\N
	she just was not really into meeting new people.
	一辈子都在笑面以对\N
	I mean after a lifetime of being sweet as a pie,
	自从祖父死后 她受到了很大的打击\N
	once grandpa died, she got kind of awry.
	是吗 那时她还在服丧吧\N
	Really? It happens, she was in mourning, no?
	没错 我父亲说她一直在等死\N
	Yeah, well, my dad said she was just waiting to die.
	他们结婚多久了\N
	How long were they married?
	七十四年了\N
	74 years.
	靠 怎么可能\N
	Fuck! How is that even possible?
	要是我们也一起生活七十四年 那得多老啊\N
	How old will we be if we were together for 74 years?
	那我们要从什么时候开始算起\N
	Hm, when do we start counting from?
	我想应该从我们第一次发生关系时算起吧\N
	I guess from the first time we had sex.
	好吧\N
	Ok...
	那应该是一九九四年\N
	OK, so... 1994.
	好吧 一九九四年 那还有五十六年\N
	Ok... 1994... 56 years from now.
	那时我们都九十八岁了\N
	We will be 98.
	天哪 你还能\N
	Oh! Would you be able to
	再忍受我整整五十六年吗\N
	put up with me for another 56 more years?
	我得搞清楚 我不知道自己\N
	I need to know. I do not know
	是不是还能忍你那么长时间\N
	if I'm gonna be able to put up with you.
	你想想他们见证的那些变化 真不可思议\N
	It's crazy if you think about all the change they saw.
	当他们见到彼此已经没有了最初的感觉\N
	I mean, when they met, neither one of them had electricity.
	他过去常常骑马带她上学\N
	He used to take her to school on his horse.
	毕业时他们两个分别是致辞的学生代表\N
	When he graduated, he was valedictorian and she was salutatorian.
	- 什么意思  - 祖父第一名 祖母第二名\N
	- What is that?  - He was top of the class and she was second.
	我敢说一定是祖母故意放水\N
	I bet she knowingly got a couple of answers wrong,
	你祖父才会轻松拿到第一\N
	so that he did not feel threatened.
	如果她想轻松一点 这就是最好的办法\N
	Well, if she wanted to get laid, she'd better have.
	没错 你知道 有人就是这么做的\N
	Yes, obviously like you know who.
	不管怎么说 在收到短信之后\N
	Anyway, so I called my dad, right,
	我告诉我爸爸\N
	after I got the text, just, you know,
	我很遗憾\N
	to tell him I was sorry,
	我想我可能说错了一些话\N
	I think I got screwed up at some point said...
	爸爸 你现在是孤儿了 我觉得这不好笑\N
	Hey, dad, you're an orphan now, I don't think it was funny.
	- 一点都不好笑  - 好吧 好像是不好笑\N
	- Not funny at all  - Yeah, I guess not.
	- 下一个是他 之后就是你  - 我知道\N
	- He's next, then you.  - I know.
	他告诉我说 我的祖父母\N
	Well... he told me that my grandparents
	想要死后葬在一起\N
	wanted to have a joint service.
	他们希望两人的骨灰能埋在一起\N
	They wanted to have their ashes intermingled and be buried as one.
	你祖父没有办葬礼吗\N
	Your grandfather didn't have a funeral?
	他们彼此立誓\N
	They vowed to each other
	绝不去参加对方的葬礼\N
	they'd never have to attend one another's funeral.
	好吧 我更希望你能参加我的葬礼\N
	Oh yeah... I kind of like the idea of you attending mine.
	- 什么  - 不是 我是说 我在想象\N
	- What?  - No, I know... I'm imagining you in a suit,
	你穿上正装 刮干净胡子的样子\N
	clean-shaven for once,
	挽着女儿们的手 我不知道 我就是喜欢\N
	holding hands with the girls, I don't know, I like it.
	- 你会活得比我长的  - 到时候就知道了\N
	- You're gonna outlive me.  - We'll see.
	我想我们俩只有一个人能看到那一天\N
	I guess one of us will see.
	你觉得我们也葬在一起怎么样\N
	What do you think you're gonna go to the service with me?
	- 去德克萨斯吗  - 反正不在巴黎\N
	- To Texas?  - It's not gonna be in Paris.
	你有多想把我葬在那儿\N
	Ok, how bad you want me there?
	其实我很愿意去 只不过机票太贵了\N
	I mean I would come but it's really expensive with the flights.
	其实一个人去会容易很多\N
	Truth is it would be simpler to go alone.
	你好\N
	Oh, hello!
	如果我不在那儿\N
	Well, you know and if I'm not there,
	你和你表姐就可以发生点什么了\N
	it will be easier for you to fuck your cousins.
	- 没错  - 你们那儿这种事很常见吧\N
	- Yes, that's true.  - Isn't that common where you come from?
	- 你还没回答我的问题  - 什么问题\N
	- You didn't answer the question.  - What question?
	好吧 你还能再忍受我五十六年吗\N
	Well... will you be able to put up with me for 56 more years?
	- 我也想知道  - 你又来了\N
	- I'm looking forward to it.  - Shit, you're really working it.
	你性爱时的甘露就如同陈年美酒\N
	The nectar of your sex ages like a fine wine.
	我长毛的西班牙小伙又变身希腊人了\N
	O-o, my hairy Spanish lover is back Greek,
	我现在是希腊人\N
	I'm Greek now.
	看看这个\N
	Look at this!
	这地方让我想起了\N
	Wow, this place reminds me
	我小时候看过的一部电影\N
	a bit of a movie I saw when I was a teenager.
	那是一部五十年代的黑白片\N
	It was a black and white film from the 50s.
	我记得 有一对夫妇走在庞贝古城的废墟旁\N
	I remember a couple walking through the ruins of Pompeii,
	看着那些在那里躺了好几个世纪的尸骸\N
	viewing bodies that had been lying there for centuries.
	我还记得那些尸骸\N
	I remember the bodies, you know,
	他们在睡梦中被捕的时候还紧拥着爱人\N
	caught in their sleep still lovingly holding each other.
	我也不知道为什么 有时候我经常在想\N
	I don't know why, sometimes I have this image in my mind,
	你搂着我 我们躺在一起\N
	where, you know, we're asleep and you hold me.
	在炽热的灰烬下被活活掩埋\N
	What... of being buried alive under molten ash?
	- 你就是在想这些吗  - 是的\N
	- That's what you're thinking about?  - Yes!
	这可一点都不好玩\N
	That's not very fun!
	我不知道 其实也没那么可怕\N
	I don't know... It's not horrible I mean,
	他们当中 有些夫妇中间还躺着孩子\N
	they had some bodies with little kids sleeping between them.
	那很好\N
	That's nice.
	是啊 我想我年轻的时候有些病态\N
	Yeah, I guess I was young and a bit morbid,
	觉得和自己心爱的人死在一起是很浪漫的事\N
	I mean at that age you romanticize dying with the person you love.
	那现在你愿意和我一起死吗\N
	Now you want to die with me?
	也许吧 你知道 如果是\N
	Maybe you know if you were... you know,
	我们在一起的第一个晚上 也许会\N
	our first night together then,
	可那是好久以前了 现在我才不\N
	a long time ago, but now... no!
	我想活着\N
	I'd like to live!
	我也只是想来点浪漫的 也被你破坏了\N
	I just wanted you to say something romantic and you blew it!
	算了吧 去你妈的 我搞砸了\N
	Oh no! Putain de merde. I blew it!
	等我们都九十八岁了 你可以再问一次\N
	Ok, if we are both 98, you can ask me again.
	不过现在\N
	But any time sooner,
	对不起了\N
	Sorry.
	这就是我说过的那个拜占庭时期\N
	Hey... This is the chapel I was telling you about.
	就有了的小教堂 已经有一千年历史了\N
	It's from the Byzantine era, like a 1000 years old.
	- 我们能进去吗  - 当然能了\N
	- Can we go in?  - Yes, I think so.
	来看看 有人吗\N
	Check this out! Hello!
	这是圣奥蒂莉亚的神龛 她是视力的守护神\N
	It's a shrine to St. Odilia, the patron saint to eyesight.
	人们从各处前来\N
	People come from all over
	给盲人留下各种小贡品\N
	and they leave little dedications to the blind
	帮助他们恢复视力\N
	to help restore sight.
	一定很灵吧\N
	I'm sure, it works.
	这里的这些画\N
	And these paitings here,
	让我联想到日本的和尚\N
	they make me think of those Japanese monks, you know,
	还有他们的无常思想\N
	with their deal on impermanence?
	天热时 他们喜欢用水在石头上画画\N
	They like to paint with water on rock on hot days
	所以画完的时候 就都蒸发了\N
	so by the time they're done it's already evaporated.
	眼睛被挖掉了 是和失明有关吗\N
	Oh, the eyes are scratched out is that about blindness?
	不 我本来也那么想\N
	No, I thought that too,
	但是那个看守人\N
	but the caretaker guy
	他告诉我 是土耳其人占领的时候干的\N
	he told me that the Turks did that during the occupation.
	好吧 我再也不吃土耳其食物了\N
	That's it. I'm never eating Turkish food again.
	好吧\N
	Oh, ok.
	那会让整个国际社会为之一颤的\N
	That will send a shiver through international community.
	好吧 那我再也不给土耳其人吹箫了\N
	OK, fine. Then I will never suck another turkish cock.
	那绝对会冲击整个世界\N
	OK that's gonna have a global impact.
	那太糟糕了\N
	Oh that's terrible.
	我忘了你是个秘密修行的基督徒\N
	No! I forgot you're a closet-Christian.
	在教堂里开黄色玩笑是不是太不敬了\N
	Is it really bad to make blowjob jokes in a church?
	有一点 但我们干过更过分的\N
	It kind of is, ok? But we've done worse.
	姑娘们又问起我们的婚礼是什么样的了\N
	The girls asked me again what our wedding was like.
	是吗 那你怎么说的\N
	Yeah? And what did you say?
	我就说 婚礼很低调\N
	I said it was very low-key.
	是很低调 以至于我都不记得这回事了\N
	Very low-key, so low-key I don't even remember it.
	贵格会
	：反对繁琐的形式，婚礼葬礼极简\N{\rCHS}很有贵格会风格吧\N{\rENG}Very quaker?
	我不知道她们为什么这么想要我们结婚\N
	I do not know why they want us to be married so badly.
	这对她们很重要\N
	It is important to them.
	- 这里是教堂 你想结婚吗  - 不想\N
	- We are in a church, do you want to get married?  - No.
	只是 她们那么喜欢那些童话\N
	It's just all those fairy tales they like so much, you know.
	记不记得 她们小一点的时候\N
	Remember when they were little
	她们看完每一部动画片\N
	and at the end of every cartoon they watched
	就会喊“他们要结婚了”\N
	they'd be all like "They are getting married!"
	甚至是匹诺曹和他爸爸\N
	Even if it was Pinocchio and his Dad,
	唐老鸭和侄子们 也不例外\N
	Donald Duck and his nephews.
	那如果我们要再一起生活五十六年\N
	So if we are going to spend another 56 more years together...
	- 怎么样  - 你希望我改变什么\N
	- Yeah?  - What about me would you like to change?
	- 怎么了  - 这又是一个答不对的问题\N
	- What?  - That's another one of your "Can't win" questions.
	- 我才不上当呢  - 说什么呢\N
	- I am not answering that.  - What do you mean?!
	难道我身上就没有一点是你想改变的吗\N
	There is not one thing that you would like to change about me?
	我这么完美吗\N
	I'm perfect?
	- 好吧 其实  - 就说一个\N
	- Ok, actually,  - One thing.
	如果你能改变一个地方\N
	if I could change one thing about you,
	我希望你不要再试图改变我了\N
	it would be for you to stop trying to change me.
	你真是个有手段的操纵者 你知道吗\N
	You are a very skilled manipulator, you know that?
	戳中你要害了吧\N
	Well, I am on to you.
	- 我知道你的套路  - 你这么想吗\N
	- I know how you work.  - You think?
	当然 我了解你的一切\N
	Yeah, I know everything about you.
	这里 我们从这里走\N
	Here we go, let's go through here.
	- 我觉得你没那么了解我  - 没有吗\N
	- I don't think you do, actually.  - No?
	至少你是我在这世上最了解的人\N
	Well, I know you better than I know anybody else on the planet.
	- 不过这可能说明不了什么  - 现在\N
	- But, maybe that's not saying much.  - Right now,
	- 什么  - 这样很好\N
	- What?  - this is great, you know?
	- 是啊  - 我觉得和你很亲近\N
	- Right. Yeah.  - I feel close to you,
	- 对  - 但有时候 怎么说呢\N
	- Yeah.  - But sometimes I don't know,
	你呼吸的是氦气 我呼吸的是氧气\N
	I feel like you're breathing helium and I'm breathing oxygen.
	为什么这么说\N
	What makes you say that?
	- 你看 我正想和你沟通  - 拜托\N
	- See? I'm trying to truly connect  - Why, come on.
	- 你却开玩笑  - 我只是想做自己\N
	- and you make a joke!  - I'm just being myself.
	- 不  - 我说的就是这个\N
	- No!  - That's exactly what I'm talking about.
	拜托 如果我们真的想要了解对方\N
	C'mon. If we ever gonna truly know each other,
	我觉得我们或许应该先看清自己\N
	I think we probably have to get to know ourselves better first.
	是啊\N
	Yeah.
	你还记得我那个朋友吗\N
	Do you remember this friend of mine,
	纽约的乔治\N
	George from New York?
	不记得\N

	Anyway, he was this friend of mine
	他得知自己得了白血病\N
	that when he found out that he had leukemia
	知道自己活不长了\N
	and he was probably gonna die,
	他向我坦言 他的第一个反应\N
	he confessed to me that the first thing that came to his mind
	- 是解脱  - 解脱 什么解脱\N
	- was relief.  - Relief? Of what?
	在他知道自己只能再活九个月之前\N
	Yeah, well, before he found out that he had nine months to live
	他总是在担心钱不够花\N
	he was always so worried about money.
	而知道了以后 他的想法是\N
	And now his thought was
	太好了\N
	"Great!"
	这些钱让我花上九个月 绰绰有余了\N
	"I have more than enough money to live the next 9 months,
	- 我成功了  - 好吧\N
	- I've made it!"  - OK.
	接着他终于学会享受生活中的一切\N
	And then he was finally able to enjoy everything about life
	甚至享受堵车的感觉\N
	even like being stuck in traffic.
	他会很享受地看着人们 看着他们的脸\N
	He would just enjoy looking at people and staring at their faces.
	- 就是这种小事  - 那后来呢\N
	- Just little things.  - And then what happened?
	什么意思\N
	What do you mean?
	就是 他现在还活着吗\N
	Well... like, is he still alive?
	不 他死了 很久了\N
	No, he died a long time ago.

	But it was just my eyelids.
	我真是够傻够天真\N
	How dumb and romantic of me.
	我喜欢的就是这个\N
	That's my favorite thing.
	我也怀念思考的感觉\N
	I miss thinking too.
	清晨再没时间思考了\N
	No more thinking in the morning.
	再没有晨光性爱\N
	No more morning sex.
	明天怎么样\N
	Tomorrow?
	我太期待了\N
	I'm looking forward to it so much,
	我觉得我要睡不着了\N
	I don't think I'll be able to sleep.
	我现在就想要\N
	I'm looking forward to it right now.
	好了\N
	OK.
	我们别说话了 开干吧\N
	Let's stop talking so we can fuck,
	然后睡觉\N
	sleep,
	醒来\N
	wake up,
	思考 再做爱\N
	think and fuck again.
	- 别接了  - 不行\N
	- Don't answer it.  - No.
	- 见鬼 谁打的  - 管他呢\N
	- Oh shit, who is it?  - Who cares?
	我说了紧急情况才打的\N
	I said to call in case of emergency only.
	希望不是姑娘们出事了\N
	I hope the girls are ok.
	是亨利\N
	Oh, it's Henry.
	亲爱的 你好吗\N
	Hey sweetie, are you okay?
	你到伦敦了吗\N
	Are you in London?
	这么快吗 好的\N
	Already? OK.
	不不 我们找到了\N
	Oh no, no, we found it.
	我们明天就寄过去 别担心\N
	We'll mail it tomorrow, don't worry.
	对\N
	Yeah.
	她们也很想你\N
	Oh, they miss you too.
	我会代你吻她们的\N

	好的\N
	OK.
	他很好\N
	He's fine.
	他说到了芝加哥就给你打电话\N
	He says he will call you from Chicago when he lands.
	为什么不让我和他说话\N
	Why can't I talk to him?
	你已经第二次这样了\N
	That's twice you've done that.
	你完全可以把手机给我的\N
	Come on, you could have just handed me the phone.
	你知道我很想和他聊聊\N
	You know I wanted to talk to him.
	他没时间多聊 他说他们在登机了\N
	Well he didn't have time to talk. He said they were boarding.
	他是什么忘带了 什么东西\N
	What did he forget? What was that?
	他的科学项目报告 我们明天就去寄\N
	His science project, but we'll mail it tomorrow.
	- 他没事的  - 你不该那样说他妈妈\N
	- He'll be fine  - You shouldn't have said that about his mom.
	什么 我说什么了\N
	What? What did I say?
	和你妈妈相处愉快\N
	"Good luck with your mom."
	- 拜托  - 我可没别的意思\N
	- I mean, c'mon...  - I  didn't mean anything by it.
	我知道 但这样不好\N
	I know, but it's not good.
	这样又让他想起了整件事情\N
	You know, it just reminds him of the whole thing
	我真希望你别那样\N
	and I wish you wouldn't do that.
	你以为我不说他就忘了吗\N
	Oh, like you think he forgets?
	真是典型的美式思维\N
	That's so American
	掩盖事实 当做从未发生\N
	to just swipe it under the carpet and act as if it didn't happen.
	我是说 为什么要让他想起来呢\N
	Why put it into his head, you know?
	或许他这会儿不想去想这件事呢\N
	What if he does not want to think about it right now?
	- 不会有影响的  - 会有一点 会的\N
	- It means nothing.  - It means something. It does.
	好吧 前些天我还和他开了个玩笑\N
	Alright, I even made a joke the other day
	说我和他妈妈应该\N
	that his mom and I should try
	来一场泥地大摔跤 才能一决胜负\N
	to settle it in one big mud wrestling contest.
	- 泥地大摔跤 你真那么说了  - 他笑了\N
	- Mud wrestling? You said that?  - And he laughed.
	或许他比你要有幽默感\N
	He might have more of a sense of humour than you do.
	拜托\N
	Come on!
	我们刚说过的\N
	I dunno, we just talked about that,
	你说他妈妈坏话的时候\N
	you know, when you say bad things about his mom
	他听见的是自己的坏话\N
	what he hears is bad things about himself.
	我可没说他妈妈坏话 我开个玩笑而已\N
	Well I didn't say anything bad about his mom, ok? I made a joke.
	开的不光是她的玩笑 也是我自己的\N
	It's as much on me as much as it is on her.
	我知道 我知道 只是 根本没必要提\N
	I know, I know. It's just why conjure it up at all, you know?
	我觉得他现在够大了\N
	I think he's old enough now.
	他知道他妈妈和我之间是怎么回事\N
	I mean, he knows how bad it is between his mother and I.
	- 是他妈妈和我  - 我什么也没做\N
	- His mom and me.  - And I didn't do anything.
	都是她冲着我来的\N
	It's all coming from her towards me.
	她恨我 没错 很久前我睡了她男人\N
	OK, she hates me. Yes. I fucked her husband a long time ago.
	或者是不是该说 他睡了我\N
	Or should I say he fucked me?
	是啊 没错\N
	Yeah, right.
	他妈妈和我本来就不和\N
	Ok, making a joke about the fact
	拿这开个玩笑 没什么大不了的\N
	that his mother and I do not love each other is not the issue.
	他不会因为这样就受到创伤\N
	That's not going to traumatize him.
	因为他已经受伤了 好吗\N
	That already happened, alright?
	现在你想转移你的负罪感给我吗\N
	And now you are trying to transfer your guilt and blame me?
	不是\N
	No.
	知道吗 反过来 如果你能一笑了之\N
	You know, on the contrary, if you can make a joke about it
	或许你就能好受点\N
	maybe you'll be able to live with it better.
	- 我是这么想的  - 好吧\N
	- That's what I think.  - OK.
	你说得对 一如既往\N
	You're right, as always.
	我们别说这个了 好吗\N
	Let's just not talk about it, ok?
	他妈妈要是个醉鬼\N
	It's nobody's fault if his mom
	或者虐待狂 可怨不得任何人\N
	is drunk and abusive psychologically.
	别那么说\N
	Don't say that!
	他得和她一起生活 想到这我就恶心\N
	I mean it makes me sick that he has to be with her
	但我想 法官会认为女人都有母性吧\N
	but I guess judges assume that women have the mother instinct.
	美狄亚
	：希腊神话中科尔喀斯国王之女，以巫术著称\N{\rCHS}她的母性就和美狄亚差不多\N{\rENG}She has the mother instinct of Medea!
	美狄亚吗\N
	Medea, huh?
	是啊 那不过是个希腊神话\N
	Yeah, after all it is a Greek myth.
	欧里庇得斯
	：希腊悲剧诗人\N{\rCHS}其实是欧里庇得斯的剧作\N{\rENG}Actually, a play by Euripides.
	一个女人 为惩罚前夫不惜杀死孩子\N
	A woman killing her kids to punish her ex-husband,
	她和这没什么两样\N
	that's basically what she's doing.
	她是在伤害他来报复你\N
	She's hurting him to get to you.
	不 她是利用他来破坏我的生活\N
	No, she's making my life hell through him.
	这才是她所做的\N
	That's what she's doing.
	但有时候 你说的话太过分了\N
	But sometimes you say things that just go too far.
	行了 别把你老婆的这个闹剧里\N
	Ok, stop blaming me for everything that is wrong
	所有的问题都怪在我身上 好吗\N
	in this whole thing with your wife, ok?
	- 是前妻 很久以前就是前妻了  - 好吧\N
	- Ex-wife! Ex-wife for a long time!  - OK,
	你当初就应该处理得好一点\N
	you should have dealt better with it a little better back then,
	她就不会这么恨我们了\N
	she wouldn't have hated us so much, ok?
	好 好 是我搞砸了\N
	OK, ok, I screwed up.
	你真是厉害 我们生活中\N
	Alright. I just love this little rewrite you do that
	有什么不如意 你都能说成是我的错\N
	everything that isn't perfect in our life gets laid at my feet.
	现在你要因为亨利 给我扣这种帽子吗\N
	Now you're putting this shit on me about Henry?
	什么帽子 你说什么呢\N
	What shit? What are you talking about?
	我来告诉你我在说什么吧\N
	Let me tell you what I am talking about.
	你这是要我搬去芝加哥 放弃我的生活\N
	The moving to Chicago and giving up my life.
	你说亨利需要你\N
	Now that you mentioned that Henry needs you
	你知道我什么感受吗\N
	how do you think that makes me feel?
	我很痛苦 知道吗\N
	I'm miserable, alright?
	我还怎么接受那份工作 你告诉我\N
	How can I take that job now? Tell me, tell me.
	- 我会有负罪感的  - 别这样\N
	- I'll feel too guilty.  - No, no, no.
	- 不行不行  - 那是你自己选择\N
	- No, no, no, no.  - That's a choice you're making
	要这样看待它的 明白吗\N
	to look at it like that, alright?
	女人就应该做养育者 这是天性\N
	It is in the nature of women to be the nurturer.
	什么\N
	The what?
	- 养育者  - 养育者\N
	- The nurturer.  - The nurturer?
	好吧 这个词我简直说不出口\N
	OK, I can't even say that fucking word.
	我就是本能地会对一切感到内疚\N
	I just naturally feel bad about everything.
	你还给我那种眼神 好像是我的错\N
	And you give me that look like it's my fault.
	什么眼神\N
	What look?
	就是怪我忘了把项目报告放进包里的眼神\N
	That I forget to put in the bag the science project look.
	- 我知道你怪我  - 我什么也没说\N
	- I know you blame me.  - I didn't say anything.
	对 你是什么也没说 你不用说出来\N
	No, you did not say anything. You didn't have to.
	- 错的从来都是我  - 好吧\N
	- Yeah, it's always my fault.  - Yeah right.
	我上班时在冰箱上看到\N
	I read on the fridge at work,
	那种用来拼句子的 贴在磁铁上的单词\N
	you know those magnet words that people make sentences with.
	有人拼了这么个句子\N
	Someone had put together:
	在牺牲的花园里 女人寻求着永生\N
	"Women explore for eternity in the vast garden of sacrifice."
	这一定是上帝的指示吧\N
	Wow, that's a sure sign from God.
	是的 这话真他妈是真理\N
	Yeah, that line is so damn true
	过去一万年来都是\N
	and it’s been for 10,000 years.
	但到此为止\N
	But that's enough, ok?
	我不想做这样的女人\N
	I don't want to be one of these women.
	就像结婚权对于同性恋\N
	Like marriage is important to gays,
	避孕对于维护女权的重要性\N
	or contraception to women rights.
	一旦我失去了信心\N
	It's the same with giving up my hopes,
	对于无数妇女\N
	with the millions of women
	我也不得不放弃她们的希望\N
	that I have had to give up their hopes.
	我不会这样的\N
	I'm not gonna do it!
	这不是我一个人的事情\N
	This is bigger than me, this means more than me.
	真精彩 连诺贝尔委员会都注意到了\N
	Wow, bravo, the Nobel Committee is taking note, and just...
	等下 我去通知一下瑞典方面 好吧\N
	Hold on a second, I'm going to alert Sweden, okay?
	面对如此多的女性压迫问题\N
	I mean... it must be a full-time job
	你一定是身负重任\N
	carrying that much feminine oppression.
	- 没错  - 遭受了这么多\N
	- It is.  - You suffered so much,
	在巴黎中产阶级家庭长大\N
	growing up in middle class Paris,
	后女性主义
	：上世纪九十年代女性追求性认同的主义\N{\rCHS}在后女性主义者时期\N{\rENG}I mean the agony in the trenches
	因索邦主义而苦恼\N
	of the Sorbonne in the post-feminist era.
	实在无法想像\N
	I can not imagine.
	你是个混蛋\N
	You're an asshole.
	知道吗 亲爱的\N
	You know what, sweetie?
	搬去芝加哥后\N
	When I move into Chicago,
	我一定要找到一套好房子\N
	I want to make sure we're able to find a nice house,
	缝制窗帘\N
	and I can sew the drapes,
	挑些搭配的床罩\N
	And pick matching bed covers...
	你今晚就打算这样度过吗\N
	So this is how you now want to be spending this evening?
	一直说这些吗\N
	I mean, this is, this is what you wanna do tonight?
	- 你先开始的  - 不\N
	- Well, you started it.  - No.
	是你一直念叨个不停\N
	You're the one who will not shut up about it.
	但如果真心想说 我是说谈论什么\N
	But if you want to talk about it, I mean really talk about it.
	那就心平气和 理性地说\N
	I would prefer to have an unemotional, rational conversation.
	你觉得我们能做到吗\N
	I mean, do you think we could do that?
	- 这可能吗  - 又开始了\N
	- Would that be possible?  - Here we go.
	要心平气和 要理性\N
	Unemotional, rational.
	你总是那个理智的人\N
	You always play the part of the one and only rational one.
	而我一直在不可理喻歇斯底里地闹\N
	And I'm the irrational, hysterical, hormone-crazy one,
	是因为我有感情\N
	because I have emotions.
	是 你以旁观者从全局角度谈论问题\N
	Yeah, you sit back and you speak from your big perspective,
	所以你说出来的一定是经过冷静思考的\N
	which means everything you say is level-headed and true.
	- 我也没有总是袖手旁观  - 整个世界\N
	- I don't always do anything.  - The world is fucked
	都被冷静而理智的男人的决策给毁掉了\N
	by unemotional, irrational men deciding shit.
	政客无故就计划开战\N
	Alright? Politicians going to war for no reason,
	商业巨头要榨干能源\N
	corporate heads deciding to rape the environment.
	钱尼·拉姆斯菲尔德 多么理智的男人\N
	Chaney, Rumsfeld, very rational men.
	钱尼·拉姆斯菲尔德 那倒是\N
	Chaney, Rumsfeld, yeah, ok.
	如果我知道解决办法\N
	If I know a solution,
	一定是经过深思熟虑才决定的\N
	Very rational thinking behind it.
	所以我们现在是怎样 挑战最终解决方案\N
	Okay, so we are there now? Us versus the final solution.
	行 这样 回答我一个问题好吧\N
	Okay... let's do it, alright? Let me ask you this, alright?
	你觉得亨利的生活\N
	Do you think Henry's life
	会不会因为你我关系更为稳定\N
	would be helped by more consistent presence
	而有所改善\N
	by you and me?
	- 又来了  - 不\N
	- Here we go.  - No.
	你不罢休 那就好好来谈谈 行不\N
	You won't drop it. So let's talk about it. Alright?
	我就问你一句\N

	汉克会不会因为你我关系更为稳定\N
	Do you think Hank's life would be better served by
	而在生活上得到更好的照顾\N
	more consistent presence from you and me?
	当然 他跟我们住一起会更好\N
	Yes! I think it would be better if he lived with us.
	- 对  - 而且他妈\N
	- Okay.  - And I think his mom
	是个酗酒又讨厌的贱人\N
	is a fucking alcoholic, hateful cunt
	利用我们在巴黎 我在生孩子的时间\N
	that used the time we were in Paris and I was giving birth,
	差点就把亨利合法驱逐出纽约\N
	and almost dying to legally move Henry out of New York.
	操丫的\N
	Fuck her!
	好 这我同意你\N
	Okay, I agree with you.
	虽然遗憾的是 我们不能让他离开美国\N
	Okay, unfortunately we can not go and get him out of America,
	但可以在想去见他的时候过去\N
	but we could if we wanted to go to him.
	虽然这是个大变动\N
	Now I know it would be a big move,
	但你还是考虑考虑如何\N
	but what do you think? I mean
	在美国就真的找不到让你开心的事情吗\N
	is there any way that you could be happy in the US?
	难道去美国就是不可能的事情吗\N
	I mean is that just out of the realm of possibility?
	也可以找一份差不多的工作的 是不是\N
	I mean you could find a comparable job there?
	- 差不多的  - 对啊\N
	- Comparable job?  - Yeah!
	- 你搞笑的吧  - 不\N
	- Are you kidding?  - No.
	为什么总让我来妥协\N
	Why am I the one that always have to make the compromises?
	天哪\N
	Jesus Christ.
	- 不应该是  - 别搞这么夸张 好吗\N
	- I mean it should be...  - Don't be so dramatic, okay?
	我 反正要搬去芝加哥这事\N
	I... Well, moving to Chicago is
	- 对我来说就是很夸张  - 我不是说\N
	- Pretty fucking dramatic to me.  - I'm not saying
	就该搬过去 我只是想谈谈这可能性\N
	we should move. I just want to talk about it.
	你就不能淡定那么两秒钟 好好谈谈吗\N
	Can you be my friend for like two seconds so we can talk?
	- 行 就一会儿  - 好的\N
	- Okay, two seconds  - Alright.
	记不记得你有一次\N
	Do you remember that time that you were like
	去接女儿们 迟到了大概三十五分钟\N
	35 minutes late to pick up the girls from school,
	你当时紧张死了\N
	and you were so stressed out,
	因为你知道她们在操场上\N
	because you knew they were out there in the playground,
	担心你是不是出什么事了\N
	wondering what the hell happened to you?
	而我 一直都有这种感觉\N
	Okay, that is the way that I feel all the time.
	我把自己的生活弄得一团糟\N
	You know, like I fucked up, I mean,
	之前一直没管他 现在我就想去接他\N
	I left him behind and I just want to go get him.
	你每次送他走就会这样\N
	You always get like this when you drop him off.
	你很失落 然后就开始跟我吵\N
	You're sad, so you start a fight.
	他没事的 他是个很棒的孩子 好吗\N
	He's fine, he's a great kid, ok?
	但事实就是他不再需要你像之前那样操心\N
	But the truth is that he does not need you the way he used to.
	你错过了可以陪伴\N
	You missed the opportunity to be with him
	在他童年每一天的机会\N
	every day of his childhood,
	已经错过了\N
	You just did.
	就算你再懊恼流泪 他也已经长大了\N
	And you can cry about it, but he is growing up.
	其他方面你是个很好的父亲\N
	You're a great father in other ways,
	离婚又不是什么稀奇事\N
	you got divorced like millions of other people.
	要说它适合吗 当然不是\N
	Was it ideal? No.
	但是\N
	But...
	听着\N
	Listen,
	如果一个月后你依旧想让我辞职\N
	if in one month, you still want me to quit my job,
	让我抛弃这些年积攒下的一切跟你走\N
	and give up everything I've been working towards all these years,
	直说就是了\N
	just ask me.
	但现在我这个想法是一直都有的\N
	But right now I I feel the same way I always have.
	我可以搬回美国\N
	I would move back to the US
	只要你的变态前妻能共享共同监护权\N
	if that diseased ex-wife of yours give us joint custody.
	但每隔一周的周末就会很难熬了 杰西\N
	But every other weekend amounts to shit, Jesse.
	一学期差不多就有三十天\N
	That's less than 30 days a semester,
	而我们为了那样的生活来放弃现在的日子\N
	and I don't think it's worth it for us to change our entire lives
	是不值得的\N
	Over that kind of time.
	- 你说的没错  - 是吧\N
	- I know you're right.  - Right, right?
	看 我倒成了理性的那个\N
	See? I'm being the rational one.
	但是 汉克处境太糟 他是无辜的\N
	It's just... A shitty position. I mean Hank didn't do anything,
	可他却被一直忽略\N
	but he's the one getting kicked in the teeth.
	人或多或少都会被父母的生活所拖累\N
	We all get dragged through our parent's lives.
	如果不是我 你的婚姻又会是另种情况\N
	If it wasn't me, your marriage would have ended over something else.
	- 这你很清楚  - 当然\N
	- And you know that.  - Absolutely.
	所以他可能会被贫困家庭养育\N
	Or even worse he would have been raised
	这更糟\N
	by two miserable parents.
	没错\N
	Right...
	我真是生活一团糟啊\N
	I just really fucked that up.
	你是说因为搬来巴黎和我在一起了吗\N
	You mean you fucked up by moving to Paris to be with me?
	- 不是  - 不\N
	- No...  - No,
	- 我就知道代价太大  - 我不是…\N
	- I knew that was going to cost too much.  - That's not what I meant...
	- 停 我不是这意思  - 我就知道\N
	- Stop! That's not what I meant at all.  - I knew it.
	- 我劝过你的 好吗  - 别说了\N
	- I told you not to do this, okay?  - Stop it!
	没错 当初我抛下一切搬去纽约\N
	Okay... I moved to New York with you for two years,
	跟你住了两年\N
	and gave up everything.
	但我需要回来生孩子\N
	But I needed to be home to give birth to the twins,
	因为双胞胎生产太复杂\N
	because it was a complicated birth,
	我还想妈妈能陪我 你也是这样想的\N
	and I wanted to be with my mother and you wanted it, too.
	- 对吧  - 是\N
	- Okay?  - Yes.
	- 这是我唯一要求的事情  - 是\N
	- That's the one thing I asked from you.  - Okay.
	唯一一件 你就要因此永远责备我吗\N
	The one thing... and now you're gonna blame me forever?
	别说了 好吗\N
	Stop it, will you?
	别说了\N
	Stop it.
	如果你不想搬回美国 我们就不搬\N
	If you don't want to move back to the States, we won't.
	就不用再说了\N
	End of story.
	好吗 我只是在想\N
	Alright? I am just trying to find a way
	究竟住在哪里 我的生活才能更稳定\N
	where I can be a more consistent presence in his life
	能让他生活得更好 就像一家人一样\N
	and ideally I would like to do that as a family.
	不然你想分居还是离婚\N
	As a family or what?
	这他妈是怎么说起来的\N
	What the fuck does that mean?
	我能感受到你说的每个字\N
	I feel a passive-aggressive threat
	都带有消极进攻的威胁\N
	in everything you say,
	如果不这样 你就会怨我一辈子的\N
	Either do this or I will resent you for the rest of our lives.
	是不是\N
	No?
	没错吧\N
	Am I right?
	我觉得…\N
	You know what? I'm sensing something...
	问题在于\N
	I, I, I think the problem is,
	你不想让我有一份稳定的工作\N
	is that you do not want me to have a more substantial job.
	从某种程度上来说\N
	On some level you feel threatened
	你因为我的成就而有威胁感\N
	by my achieving anything
	在咱俩的关系中会削减你的地位\N
	that could diminish your status in our relationship.
	我在这段关系中的地位吗\N
	My status in our relationship?
	我他妈在美国学校一学期教两门 好吗\N
	I teach two courses a semester at the fucking American school, okay?
	真是有地位啊\N
	Wow, that's really some status!
	不 你会在我有这样一个绝佳的\N
	No, no. I don't think it's any coincidence
	工作机遇之时\N
	that you feel that way at the same time
	却有那样的想法绝不是偶然\N
	that I have a truly exciting job opportunity.

	外面很冷  快钻进被窝\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Snuggle in, sweetie! lt's cold out there.
	为什么会下雪? 雪是从哪里来的?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Why is it snowing, Grandma? Where does it come from?
	这说来话长\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Oh, that's a long story, sweetheart.
	-我想听  -改天再说  快睡吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-I wanna hear. -Oh, not tonight. Go to sleep.
	我还不困  告诉我吧  求求你\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I'm not sleepy. Tell me, please.
	好吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Well, all right.
	我来想想\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Let's see...
	我想就从剪刀说起吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I guess it would have to start with... scissors!
	剪刀?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Scissors?
	什么的剪刀都有\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Well, there are all kinds of scissors.
	从前  有个人的手便是剪刀\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	And once there was even a man who had scissors for hands.
	-男人? -是\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-A man? -Yes.
	-手拿剪刀? -不  是剪刀手\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Hands scissors? -No, scissor hands.
	你知道山顶那座古堡吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You know the mansion on top of the mountain?
	那里在闹鬼\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	It's haunted.
	嗯\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Well...
	很久以前\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	A long time ago...
	有位发明家住在那里\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	an inventor lived in that mansion.
	他发明了许多东西\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	He made many things, I suppose.
	他甚至创造出一个人\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	He also created a man.
	他给他造了器官  心脏  头脑  以及一切\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	He gave him insides, a heart, a brain, everything.
	几乎什么都有了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Well, almost everything.
	但那发明家年纪很大了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You see, the inventor was very old.
	他临死前  尚未完成一切\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	He died before he got to fiinish the man he invented.
	所以就留下了那个男孩\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	So the man was left by himself,
	未被完成  并且非常孤单\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	incomplete and all alone.
	他有没有名字?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	He didn't have a name?
	他当然有名字\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Of course he had a name.
	他叫爱德华\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	His name was Edward.
	雅芳来拜候你\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Avon calling!
	-你不是刚来过吗? -不  那是上一季了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Weren't you just here? -No, not since last season!
	今天我是来展示新系列眼影\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Today I've come to show you our exquisite new line of softer colours, in shadows,
	粉底  唇膏\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	blushes and lipstick.
	配合你瞬息万变的容颜\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Everything you need to accent and highlight your changing look.
	瞬息万变的容貌? 真好\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	My changing look... That's good!
	另外你喜欢的系列我也有\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I also have a complete selection of your old favourites,
	这是本公司一向畅销的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	those tried and true products we've all come to depend on year in and year out.
	你知我从未跟你买过\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Come on, Peg, I never buy anything from you.
	我知道  再见  海伦  再见\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I know. Bye, Helen.
	这个不用叫我啊\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Um, you didn't have to call me, ma'am. 
	你应该可以自己修理\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You could have taken care of this by yourself.
	那里可以\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I could? I don't think so.
	只是水管塞了而已\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	It's easy. Your food trap's clogged, that's all.
	你把这个圆球卸下来\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	See this bolt here? You just unscrew this...
	看\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Mm-hm...
	这不就下来了吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	And out she pops.
	电视说  水电工都很寂寞\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	On TV they say you repairmen are a lonely bunch.
	其实我们家庭主妇也很寂寞\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Housewives get lonely too,
	卸下来后\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	And then you just take this 
	再小心的装回去\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	and put it back in here nice and easy. Be careful not to force it.
	别使劲  这尺寸刚好塞进  然后再转回去\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	And then you just screw this back on.
	会是谁啊\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Oh, now who could that be?
	失陪一下\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Will you excuse me for a moment?
	别乱跑  我马上回来  你教得太出色\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Now, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. This is fascinatin'!
	我不想错漏任何一部份\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I wouldn't wanna miss a moment of it!
	-早  雅芳来拜候你  -为什么\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Good morning, Joyce. Avon calling! -Why, Peg...
	你是不是盲的? 看见我这里停了一部车吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Have you gone blind? Can't you see that vehicle in my drive?
	看见\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Oh. Yes.
	这就表示现在我很忙\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Don't you realise that means I'm busy?
	现在我们来选唇膏\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	OK, now we should decide on lipsticks.
	你最喜欢哪一支? 你擦桃红色很迷人\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	OK, dear, did you like the Winsome Wahini, which looked charming on you,
	或者是橙红色\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	or the Bahimini Bliss?
	-我两款都喜欢  -太好了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-I like 'em both. -Well, great!
	你不会以为我有钱吧?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You don't actually think I have any money, do you?
	叮当  雅芳推销小姐\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Ding-dong! The Avon lady!
	今天运气真差\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}

	Your mother?
	你父亲呢?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Your father?
	他没有醒来\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	He didn't wake up.
	你一个人吗? 只有你一个人住在这里?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Are you alone? Do you live up here all by yourself?
	你的脸怎么了?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	What happened to your face?
	我不会伤害你\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I won't hurt you.
	让我为你敷收敛剂\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	At the very least, let me give you a good astringent.
	这可以防止感染细菌\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	This will help to prevent infection.

	Hi. Yeah, it's Marge.
	我刚刚在外面和嘉露聊天\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I was standing outside talking to Carol, and Peg drove by. 
	看见碧姬载了一个男人\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	She had somebody with her.
	-你看清楚是谁? -我没看清楚\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Did you get a good look at him? -No, I didn't.
	她家有客人要来吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Did she say anything to you about having a guest?
	她没说  今早她来按过门铃\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Nothing at all. She rang my doorbell at the crack of dawn.
	我们待会街角见\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	No... OK, I'll meet you on the corner.
	好  再见\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Right. Bye.

	前门在这儿  我们从这里进去\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Here, dear. Here we go. This is the front door. Here we go. Right in here.
	乔伊斯  碧姬跟个男人在一起\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Joyce? I just saw this strange guy drive in with Peg. 
	我没看清他什么样子\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I didn't get a good look.
	只是脸很苍白\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	He looked kinda pale.
	一定要预我参与\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	On my way. Don't do anything without me.
	好  马上到\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Yes! Be right there!

	Here we are.
	这是卧室  浴室在后头\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	So... um, this is the living room and back here are the bedrooms.
	你想看照片  好吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You want to see the pictures? All right.
	这是我先生  比尔  他是保龄球冠军\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}

	Do you know what bowling is?
	保龄球?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Bowling?
	这张是在湖边钓鱼\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	No. Well... Here they are down at the lake, fishing.
	凯文看来不太高兴\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I think Kevin looks a little glum 
	因为那天他们一条鱼也没钓到\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	because they didn't catch anything that day.
	这是我女儿嘉莉\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	And, um... here's my daughter Kim.
	盛装参加初中毕业舞会\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	All dressed for the junior prom.
	她现在升上高一了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	She's a senior now, ifyou can believe it!
	她跟朋友去露营  过几天便回来\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	She's camping in the mountains with friends,
	到时就可以见到她\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	but she'll be back in a few days. You can meet then.

	这是葡萄  后面这是卧室\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}

	这件不错\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	This is perfect!

	Now you can go in Kim's room and put these on, and I'll be right with you.
	他有剪刀  对\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	No, no, scissors. No, scissors.
	没错  他大概在山上出生吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	That's right. Well, he was... born up there or... something.
	-你见过他? -我想他以前没下来过\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Have you seen him before? -No, I doubt he's ever been off the grounds.
	那你怎么和他在一起?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Then how did you ever get together with him?
	下次再跟你说\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Listen, I have to go now. I'll talk to you later, Marge. Bye-bye.

	-真的? -是的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Really? -Yes.
	那些疤我可以想办法\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Now, I can help with the scars...

	凯文\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Kevin!
	凯文\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Kevin!
	这么看人很不礼貌\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	It's not polite to stare, dear.
	要是人家这么看你  你怎感想\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Think how it would make you feel if somebody were staring at you.
	-我不在乎  -我在乎  不要再这么看了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-I wouldn't care. -Well, I would, so don't do it!
	这对你可是很大的改变\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Well, this must be quite a change for you, right, Ed?
	-你叫他爱德华好了  -好的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Edward, dear. I think he prefers Edward. -Oh, sure.
	你在上面大房子里做什么?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	So what have you been doin' with yourself up there in that big old place?

	我只是...\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	No, I... I just...
	可以看到海边吧?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	See all the way to the ocean, I bet, huh?

	Man, those things are cool!
	一定比剃刀锋利  要是头颈挨这一手刀...\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I bet they're razor-sharp. One karate chop to a guy's neck...
	凯文\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Kevin...!
	爱德华\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Edward,

	Kevin, I've had enough.
	你可以睡觉吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Do you think you can sleep?
	生活起居  你很快会习惯的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I know things feel strange, but soon you'll feel right at home.
	-晚安  -晚安\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Good night. -Good night.
	先抹些淡色盖斑霜\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	The light concealing cream goes on first,
	然后混在一起\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	then you blend and blend and blend.
	这是秘决\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Blending is the secret.
	嗯\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Mm-hm!
	再抹上一点\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	More concealing cream...
	你的五官很好\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Your complexion is so fair!
	这种霜带点淡紫色的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Now, this has a touch of lavender in it...
	这里也抹一点\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Give it a try here.
	差不多了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Close enough!
	很好  这应该可以了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	OK, this should do the trick here.
	好的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Hmph!
	我想到另一主意\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I have another idea.
	我先把疤痕补平  再开始化妆\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	We'll cover up the scars and start with a completely smooth surface.
	该死的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Darn this stuff!
	现在的比分是3比1\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	They  still  have  11  on  the  scoreboard,  and  it's  three  to  one.
	球向华伦的空隙飞去\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	It's  through  the  gap  to  Warren.
	变成12个安打了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Now  they  change  it  to  12  hits.
	大声点  我听不见\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Turn it up, Kevin, I can't hear it!
	凯文\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Kevin!
	你有没有听见?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Did you hear that, Mr Boggs?
	听不见  大声点\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	No, make it louder!

	我感觉得出他有魔鬼法力\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	The power of Satan is in him, I can feel it.

	战时受的伤  使我没了知觉  一点知觉也没有\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Took some shrapnel during the war, and ever since then I can't feel a thing!
	别让人说你是残废\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Don't you ever let anybody tell you you have a handicap.
	谁残废了? 我的天\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Who's handicapped? My goodness.
	不要说笑  你才不是残废  你...怎么说?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Don't be ridiculous! You're not handicapped, you're...

	My name's Joyce, 
	你还没尝神仙沙拉\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}

	-What? -I thuzhizha zhizhgabab.
	的确是\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	It is shish kebab. It was a figure of speech.
	但要了解别人说话背后含意\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You shouldn't take things so literally.
	假设我们在客厅  女主人招待茶\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Let us pretend we are in the drawing room and the hostess is serving tea.
	我们面对许多问题\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Many numerous little questions confront us.
	接茶时  应站起来吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Should the man rise when he accepts his cup oftea?
	可以用剪刀手拿糖吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	May lump sugar be taken with the fingers?
	不\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	No.
	再接受第二杯茶合适吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Is it good form to accept a second cup?
	餐巾应完全打开呢?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Should the napkin be entirely unfolded...
	还是应保留中间折痕?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	or should the centre crease be allowed to remain?
	我们难免会犯尴尬的错误\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	It is so easy to commit embarrassing blunders,
	但礼仪能使我们知所进退\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	but etiquette tells us just what is expected of us...
	避免陷入狼狈失礼及不安中\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	and guards us from all humiliation and discomfort.
	真的很闷吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Mm, yes. Boring.
	我们改看一些...\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Let us switch to, uh...
	诗\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}

	有位来自好望角的老人\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	There was an old man from the Cape,
	他做了件皱纱大衣\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Who made himseIf garments of crepe.
	有人问大衣会破吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	When asked: Will they tear?
	他说已经破了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	He replied: Here and there,
	但反而好看\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	But they keep such a beautiful shape!
	对了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	That's right.
	笑吧很有趣的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Go ahead, smile. It's funny.
	好\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	That's right.

	Everything's still sopping.
	-我等不及要洗个澡  -还有睡回在床上\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-I can hardly wait to take a shower. -And to sleep in a bed.

	If my parents have the alarm set, I'm screwed.
	我不是叫你先打电话回家\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I told you to call them and tell them we're coming back early.
	-那你自己有没有? -他就是喜欢抱怨\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-But did you? -Nope, he'd rather complain.
	为什么永远都针对我?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	How else am I supposed to get attention?
	-你有否打电话回家? -我们家没那么紧张\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-You didn't call your parents. -They don't run things like a police state.

	她令你紧张吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	She get you nervous?
	你在那个城堡独居太久了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You've been cloistered away up in that castle too long.
	对少女一点概念也没有  她们最疯狂了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You don't know about the wonderful world of teenage girls. They're all crazy.
	-这能令你镇定一点  -这是什么?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Here, this'll straighten you right out. -What is it?
	柠檬汁\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Lemonade.
	我也不懂她们\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I don't know what it is.
	女孩到了某个年纪\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	They reach a certain age...
	荷尔蒙使身体发胀\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	They develop these gland things, their bodies swell up...
	于是便疯狂起来了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	They go crazy.

	Glands?
	是的  荷尔蒙\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Yeah, glands.

	Now, you stay in Kevin's room tonight 
	明天再整理你的房间\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	and tomorrow we'll fix your room right up.
	你为何带他来这里\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Why did you have to bring him here?
	要是你也会这么做\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I couldn't have left him all alone. You'd have done the same.
	为什么他要住这里\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Why does he have to stay here?
	天  他不像你啊  他天生如此\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	My goodness, Kim, I'm surprised at you. He can't help the way he is.
	-有点同情心吧  -我有同情心啊\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Have a little sympathy. -I do have sympathy.

	Lemonade?
	向头颈这么一劈他就完了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	One chop to a guy's neck, and it's all over.
	他的剪刀锐利无比  什么都削得断\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Sharpest things in the world. They can hack through anything.
	还有...\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	And...
	我觉得这东西很奇怪\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	They give me the creeps.

	嘉莉\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Kim!

	-Oh, no. -That's him?

	They keep things locked up.
	我爸不准我碰\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	My father has his own room for his stuff to make sure I can't use it.
	他很吝啬甚至不替我买车子\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	He won't even help me buy an old car.
	他要你自食其力  养成独立\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	He probably wants you to pay for it yourself. It builds character. 
	以后你会更感激他\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You'll appreciate it more.
	谈到钱...\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Dad...!
	爱德华  提到钱\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}

	Now, Bill... Marge made him cookies today.
	亲爱的...\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Sweetheart...
	你不能拿饼  去买东西...\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You can't buy the necessities of life with cookies.
	饼干买不到车子  对吧?占美\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You can't buy a car with cookies. Am I right, Jim?
	是的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Uh, that's true, sir, you can't.
	我不敢吃  他的手碰过\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I... I can't eat that. He used his hands.
	我觉得不卫生\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	It's... I don't think it's sanitary.
	对不起\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I'm sorry.
	我替你把衣服弄干净\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Honey, you want me to help you clean that up?
	不用了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	No, that's OK.
	我马上回来\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I'll be right back.
	这是我的爱丽丝吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Alexis? Oh, this can't possibly be my Alexis!
	她看起来美极了  看看你\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	She looks so beautiful! Look at you! Sweetie!
	好漂亮谢谢\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	She's gorgeous. Thank you!
	等一会  他在决定发式\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	It won't be long. She just has to decide on the style.
	然后就好了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	And then it'll be fine.
	让它看起来大一点  就像我的头发一样\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I was hopin' for somethin' big and kinda bouffant. Kinda like mine?
	小狗狗  别怕\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Now don't you worry, Kisses, you're gonna be just fine. 
	你会变得好漂亮的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You're gonna be so pretty.
	是的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Yes, you are. Oh!
	哦  天啊\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Oh! My!
	哦\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Oh! Ohh!
	爱德华  你没有不会剪的吧?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Oh! Eddie, is there anything you can't do?
	真是叹为观止\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You take my very breath away, I swear. Look at this!
	你替女人剪过发吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Have you ever cut a woman's hair?
	来替我剪吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Would you cut mine?
	这是我一生中最难忘的经历\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	That was the single most thrillin' experience of my whole life.
	连总裁都知道了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	They're getting the head of the company!
	-我回来了  -亲爱的  我们在这里\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-I'm home! -Hi, honey. We're in here.
	-嗨  -嗨\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Hi. -Hi!
	你把头发怎么了?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	What did you do to your hair?
	爱德华剪的  很野吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Edward cut it. Isn't it wild?
	真不敢相信能亲自和你说话\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Hello? Oh, I can't believe I'm talking to you in person.
	真是好荣幸\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	This is such an honour.
	他就在这里\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Yes. He's right here.
	那你都清楚知道了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	So then you know all about it.
	我正是用那种敷料\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Uh-huh. Well, that's exactly what I've been using.
	我在调教份量上有一点问题\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Well, I've had a little trouble getting it the right consistency... 
	只是一点\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	well, just a little.
	我会试试看\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I'll try that. Uh-huh.
	你这建议真好\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Well, what imaginative suggestions.
	我会的  多谢您\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I sure will. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.
	难怪人家是做总裁的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	No wonder she's the head of the company.
	她原先也只是个业务代表\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You know, she started out as a sales representative just like me.
	我一直就想跟她谈谈\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I've always wanted to talk to her, but until now I never had a reason.
	谢谢你  爱德华\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Thanks, Edward.
	-她有好主意? -她当然有\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-She had some ideas? -You bet she did.
	-哦  -嗯\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Uh-huh! -Mm-hm!
	我来开\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I'll get that.
	爱德华  我们到了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Edward. We're here.
	把剪子磨利点吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Come on, let's get you sharpened up.
	-有吗? -我真不敢相信\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-You got it? -No. I can't believe this.
	这真是个好剪刀\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	This is such a drag.
	嗨\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Hi!
	-再见  -再见\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Bye. -Bye.
	你有钥匙吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Do you have a key?
	没有\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	No.
	-我发誓他们都在我的包里  -我们进退两难了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-I could have sworn they were in my purse. -Well, we're stranded.
	谢谢\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Wow! Thanks!
	干得好  你没把门锁弄坏吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Ed! What a guy! Good job. You didn't break it or scratch it or anything.
	碧姬回来就通知我们\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Hey, be a pal and yell when Peg pulls in, huh?
	真是离奇的故事  有没有人要发问?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Quite a story, yes? Any questions for Edward?

	I know a doctor that might be able to help you.
	我愿意跟他碰头\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I'd like to meet him.
	名字我们待会再说  谢谢\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	We'll get that name after the show. Thank you. That's very nice.
	还有谁要发问? 若你的手是正常的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Anyone else? Yes, stand right up.
	你就会跟普通人一样\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	But then you'd be like everyone else.
	我知道\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Yes, I know.
	他会喜欢的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I think he'd like that.
	没有人会再觉得你很特殊\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	But then no one would think you were special.
	你也不会再上电视\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You wouldn't be on TV or anything.
	无论如何  爱德华都是特殊的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	No matter what, Edward will always be special.

	Your work is so interesting, distinctive and unique.
	你想不想开家美容院呢?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}

	Sure he does. Right, Kim?
	-是吧? 嘉莉? -你又让他来难为我了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Right, Kim? -Great! Now you got him started.
	别吵\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Knock it off, bubble-butt.
	-是你先挑起的  -那怎么样?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-You did it. -So?
	你心中有没有心仪的女孩?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}

	We'll take a break and we'll be back after these messages.
	笑什么? 他受伤了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Why are you laughing? He got hurt!
	-只是电击一下  -电击一下?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-It was just a little shock. What do you care? -A little shock?!
	我倒想录下来  再看一遍\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I wish we'd been taping that. I'd give my left nut to see that again.
	你难道不兴奋吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Aren't you excited? This is so thrillin'!
	我们这一家美容院\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Wait till I show it to you. It's just perfect. 
	实在太棒\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	It's just what we've been lookin' for.
	我想取名为"剪发乐园"\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I wanna call it Shear Heaven!
	我们到了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Ohh! And here we are.
	这里摆一排的镜子\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Now, all along here I'm gonna put a row of new mirrors.
	后面呢...\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	And back along here, well, I think...
	来吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Eddie! Come along, doll.
	这边是一系列的化妆品  一整排都是\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Back up here a whole row of new cosmetics. And all along this row here...
	-碧姬可以在这里售货  -对啊\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Peg could sell cosmetics. -Yeah... Sure.
	洗头的地方在此\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	And this of course is where we wash the hair.
	我便在这里招呼客人\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	And here is where I stand... when I greet the customers.
	后面才是我最要跟你介绍的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	But back in here is what I really wanna show you.
	爱德华  这才是我要给你看的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Eddie... This is what I really want to show you.
	这是我们的贮藏室\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Now, this is the storeroom where we keep everything,
	每天我需要你替我作个决定\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	and what I need from you today is a decision I need you to help me make.
	不  那很危险\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Oh, honey, no! No, don't. That's dangerous.
	你坐在这里\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Now, you just sit right down there...
	我有件工作服  我来为你示范好吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I have some smocks. Would you like me to model them for you?
	好的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Yes.
	好的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	OK.
	这是我最喜爱的一件\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Now, this is my favourite.
	因为是黄色的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Because it's yellow...
	它的作用是...\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	And what it's for...
	可以阻止头发掉下来\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	is to catch those itchy little trimmings that fall down your neck.
	还有一件是紫色的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	And then there's this old purple one that you just kinda...
	就是只有一片盖在上面\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	drape around you like this.
	我喜欢这一件\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I like that one.
	你为什么在发抖\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Why, Eddie, you're tremblin'.
	我也是\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	So am I!
	我已期待这一刻好久了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I've been waitin' for this moment for so long.
	爱德华\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Edward!
	回来  你不能这样便走了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Edward, you come back here! You can't do that!
	魔术贴\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Velcro, sweetheart.
	-就是仪表板上用的双面夹  -我从未见过\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-It hangs on the dashboard. -I've never seen that.
	-对不起  我来迟了  -嗨  爱德华\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Sorry I'm late. -Hi, Edward.
	对不起  我们吃起来了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Sorry, dear, we had to go ahead without you. There you go.
	今天工作情形如何?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	So, Edward, did you have a productive day?
	马太带我去看美容院的地点\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Mrs Monroe showed me where the salon will be.
	-你会有个化妆专柜  -不好吗\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-You could have a cosmetics counter. -Wouldn't that be great?
	真棒\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Great.
	她带我到贮藏室  然后脱去衣服\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Then she showed me the back room where she took all her clothes off.
	听你这么说  我很高兴\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Edward, I can't tell you how thrilled I am. I'm as pleased as punch.
	你在美容院可学到不少\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	This venture's gonna teach you volumes.
	还是经营自己的事业好\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	There's nothin' like running your own business.
	听你这么一说\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I've never done it myself,
	你的工作真是令人满意\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	but I gather it's the greatest satisfaction a working man can have.
	接下来  你就要跟银行打交道\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	So I guess the bank's gonna be your next step, huh?
	银行?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	The bank?
	去贷款  准备起步\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Yeah. Take out a loan, get yourself started.
	凭你的功夫  很快便可闯出名堂\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Nothin' to worry about. With your talent and reputation, it's gonna be a snap.
	是啊\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Yeah.
	没有银行记录\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	No credit,
	没有往来记录  亦无工作记录\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	no record of jobs you've held,
	没有存款\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	no savings,
	与私人投资\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	no personal investments...
	没保险号码  你根本就不存在\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	No social security number you may as well not even exist...
	-没有抵押品  -我们的房子已抵押\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-There is no collateral. -No, we already have a second on the house.
	法院的证词可以吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	But don't the testimonials count?
	市长太太都要来请他剪发\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Did you see here the mayor's wife can't wait to become a client?
	实在很难办到\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	We simply can't do it.
	你先去办理社会保险号码\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Now, get yourself a social security card, establish credit 
	然后用信用额买车\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	and buy yourself a car.
	你会有很好优待\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You have a decided advantage. You can get a handicapped placard...
	残障专用车可以任意停车\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	and park anywhere you like.
	简直是欺人太甚\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I can't believe it. It's just an outrage.
	别担心  无论如何我们会筹钱\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	But don't you worry. This isn't the end of it. We'll get your money somehow.
	-这是违法擅闯呀  -我父母已经买了全保\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-But that's breaking and entering. -My parents have insurance up the rear.
	下星期  我爸便会全修好\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	What'll it cost them? A little hassle, that's about it.
	-我们不能这样做  -那可以替我们弄到钱\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-We can't. -This guy'll give us cash for the stuff.
	你不想要车吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You don't want us to have our own van where we can be alone? 
	我们爱去那里都可以?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	And a mattress in the back?
	你难道不能自己偷吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Why can't you do it?
	我们需要爱德华来开门\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Because the room's locked and we need Edward to get us in.
	趁你爸睡时你去拿钥匙呀\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Can't you take the key when he's sleeping?
	钥匙不在他身边\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	The only thing he hangs on to tighter is his dick.
	嘉莉  他会为你做任何事\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Razor Blades'll do anything for you. -That's not true.
	-这话什么意思? 你自己不会去问他  -这样不公平\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Oh, no? Why don't you ask him? -That's not fair.
	-没有其它方法呀  -一定有的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-So what? There isn't any other way. -There's gotta be.
	我都想过了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Look, I've racked my brain.
	你难道不想我们拥有部车\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Don't you want us to have our own van?
	想呀\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Well... yeah.
	灯还亮着\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Jim, the lights are on!
	灯自动会亮  爸妈度周末去了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Those go on automatically. They're gone for the weekend, I told you.
	用来防止小偷的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	In case of burglars.
	-警戒系统你关了吧? -是的  走吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-You turned off the alarm? -Yes. Let's go.
	我讨厌这样\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I hate this.
	我真不敢相信  他不晓得这是占美的家\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Are you sure he doesn't know this is Jim's house?
	-他从未来过这里  他去偷过你家? -小声点\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-This person stole from you? -Shh! Keep it down!
	我告诉过你他去偷过  走吧  走\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I told you he stole it, OK? Let's go!
	他父母会要他交回吧?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Tell his parents and they'll make him give it back.
	我试过  你答应了嘉莉走吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Listen, I already tried that. Now, you told Kim you'd do this. Let's go.
	走\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Come on!
	快\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Come on!
	快...\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	OK, come on. Come on.
	快\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Come on, come on, come on! Now! Come on!
	我爸里头也安装了防盗\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	The bastard had it wired separately. Come on!
	我们不能丢下他\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	No, Jim, we can't just leave him here!
	-快  -我要这么做\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Come on. -I'm not gonna do this!
	-快点  -停下\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Just come on, Kim. -Stop!
	放我下来\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Put me down!
	放我下来\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Put me down!
	我们知道你在里面\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	We know you're in there!
	现在取消防盗设定让你出来\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	We're in the process of deactivating the system so that you can come out!
	-丹尼  回去  -不行\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Denny, turn around! -No way.
	你不会因误触警铃而被捕\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Jim, they can't arrest you for setting off your own alarm.
	我会告诉他们我们害怕跑掉了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	We'll tell 'em we freaked and ran.
	-我不回去  -我们必须回去\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-I'm not going back there, OK? -We have to!
	我父亲会告我的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	No. My father would prosecute.
	-他的儿子  -告自己的儿子?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-His own son? -Especially his own son.
	是  爱德华说的话我便杀他\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	And if Edward tells I'll kill him!
	-丹尼  回去  -不\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Denny, turn around! -No!
	我们一定要回去\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You have to!
	举起手让我们看见\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	We want your hands high in the air where we can see them!
	举手\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Put your hands up!
	他手上好像有刀\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	He's holding something. Looks like knives.
	抛下武器\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Drop your weapons!
	我重覆  抛下武器\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I repeat... drop your weapons!
	我再警告一次  抛下武器\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I'm gonna ask you one more time. This is your last warning. Drop your weapons.
	再不服从  我们就开枪  别逼我们开枪\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	If you fail to do so we'll have to open fire. Don't make us do that, buddy.
	抛下武器\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Drop your weapons. Drop 'em!
	快\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Now!
	碰到一个神经病的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Looks like we got a psycho.
	-预备开枪  -不\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Prepare to fire! -Marge No! No!
	-退后  -那是他的手  不是武器\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Stand back, ladies! -Those aren't weapons, those are his hands!
	我们认识他\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Please. We know him.
	锁起来\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	All right. Cuff him.
	-我们可以看他吗? -我们要拘留他观察一晚\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-But we can see him now? -We're going to have to hold him overnight.
	-他要留下? -明早再带他回去\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-He has to stay in prison all night? -You can pick him up in the morning.
	爱德华\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Oh, Edward!
	爱德华\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Hello, Edward.
	这都怪我不好\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Oh, Edward, dear. I blame myself.
	你在打什么主意?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	What in God's name was going through your mind, son?
	都是我做的坏榜样  我不该羡慕占美家有钱\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Why didn't I set a better example? You saw how I envied Jim's parents.
	你偷钱做什么呢?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	What were you gonna do with that stuff?
	我说  我们会替他筹钱开店\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I blithely say We'll get money for the salon somehow,
	我并不是要你去偷钱\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	but I never meant stealing.
	偷钱是不对的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Dear, stealing's not the way to get it. Stealing's not the way to get anything.
	你现在可有麻烦\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Uh-uh. Except trouble. And you're in a serious heap of that.
	你为什么要这么做呢?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Oh, Edward. Why ever did you do this?
	-都是电视片集害的  -那些该死的节目\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Damn those TV programmes! -Damn them all to hell!
	是不是有人叫你这样做?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Or did somebody put you up to this?
	医生  他没事吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Will he be OK, doc?
	由于长时间的分隔\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	The years spent in isolation have not given him the tools 
	他无法分辨是非\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	to judge right from wrong.
	他没有一套遵循的法则\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	He's had no context. He's been completely without guidance.
	至目前为止他的工作  园艺树雕  发型设计\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Furthermore his work, the garden sculptures, hairstyles and so forth,
	全都显示他\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	indicate that he's a highly imaginative...
	很有创造力\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	character.
	但他对现实却一无所知\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	His awareness of what we call reality is radically underdeveloped.
	放他出去会没事吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	But will he be all right out there?
	他不会有事的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Oh, yeah. He'll be fine.
	他们整晚都在担心你\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Listen, it could keep me up all night worrying about ya. 
	你到外面小心点\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You watch yourself, you hear?
	我听到声音就冲出来\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I happened to be up, so I heard all this noise...
	我就一直觉得他怪怪的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	All along I felt in my gut there was somethin' wrong with him.
	-他可能也会挑上我家  -任何一家都可能\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-It could have been my house. -Or any of our houses, but...
	我不是早警告过你们  他有魔鬼的标记\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I warned you, didn't I? I saw the sign of Satan on him.
	你们不听我的警告  你们也会看到\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You didn't heed my warning, but now you will. Because now you can see it too.
	你留在这里\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Edward, you stay here.
	-你是如何辩白的  -他不想谈\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-What do you say in your defence? -Nothing.
	-他不想说  -你必须说\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-He doesn't want to talk. -You have to say something.
	-他现在不能谈  -你是被陷害的吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-He can't talk right now. -No comments? No remarks?
	你有什么感想?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	So, were you set up? What was going through your mind?
	我们不想谈\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Huh? What do you have to say for yourself?
	-就一会  -改天再说\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-One comment. One comment. -Later.
	看来你在圣诞节以前\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Goodness, Lois, it looks like I'lI see you at our Christmas party...
	都不会来剪发\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	before I get you over for your haircut!
	今年当然要办舞会\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Well, of course we're gonna have it this year. 
	每年都有办呀\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	We have it every year. Why wouldn't we?
	好的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Well!
	你要是这么想那就错了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You may think that, but you're wrong.
	你在这里\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You're here.
	他们没伤害你吧?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	They didn't hurt you, did they?
	你害怕吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Were you scared?
	我曾要占美回去  但是他们不听\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I tried to make Jim go back, but you can't make Jim do anything.
	谢谢你没说出来\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Thank you for not telling them that we...
	不用客气\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You're welcome.
	你知道那是占美家一定很难过\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	It must have been awful when they told you whose house it was.
	我早知那是他家\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I knew it was Jim's house.
	真的?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You... you did?
	是的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Yes.
	那你为什么还要去?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Well, then why'd you do it?
	因为你叫我去\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Because you asked me to.
	{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Kimba\NKimba!
	Kimmy  嘿\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Kimmy! Hey!
	不要  你怎么了?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Don't! -What's the matter with you?
	你何时才停止?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	When are you gonna stop? I did what I could.
	我告诉我爸他是白痴  不然他早坐牢了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	My old man thinks he's retarded, so he's free. What more do you want?
	-你可以说实话  -你也可以说真话  你也有份\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-You could tell the truth. -So could you. You were there too!
	-那都是你的主意  我不想做  -你也有份参与\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-You know I didn't wanna do it. -But you did do it.
	我不知道你干嘛那么在乎\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I don't get why you give such a shit anyway.
	我们可以重换窗帘和毛巾\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Maybe there's a way you can replace the drapes and the towels,
	但要对你恢复信心可更难\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	but our confidence in you is not gonna be so easy to replace.
	爸爸\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Dad...
	教你一点公民道德\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	OK. A little ethics. You're walkin' down the street. 
	你在街上捡到一箱钱\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You find a suitcase full of money.
	附近没有人  你会怎么办?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	There's nobody around. No human person is in evidence. What do you do?
	你收下这些钱\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You keep the money.
	你用来买礼物送朋友\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You use it to buy gifts for your friends and your loved ones.
	你送给穷人\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You give it to the poor.
	你交给警方\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You turn it in to the police.
	-爸  这太愚蠢了  -金\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Dad, this is really stupid. -Kim...!
	-我会收下  -安静\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-I'd keep the money. -Simmer down.
	爱德华\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Edward?
	吃完饭  我们去打保龄球吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Hey, how about after dinner we go down to the bowling alley? That'd be fun.
	你今晚不去找占美?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You're not seeing Jim tonight?
	不去\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	No.
	今天的课棒极了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	We had the coolest show and tell today.
	有个同学带来了小袋鼠  全身光溜溜的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	This kid brought in a box of baby possums. Ten, maybe twelve. Totally naked.
	-凯文  -我想你爸还没说完话\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-No hair at all. -Honey, your father isn't finished yet.
	谢谢  爱德华我们在等你回答\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Thank you, dear. Edward, we're waiting.
	送给我的好朋友\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Give it to my loved ones?
	你觉得该这么做  但这不对\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Oh, Edward, it does seem that that's what you should do, but it's not.
	白痴呀  应该交给警方才是\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You dope, everybody knows you're supposed to give it to the police.
	凯文  你说得对\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Good thinking, Kevin.
	你们大家想一下\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Well, think about it, you guys.
	他这么做也很好\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I mean, that's the nicer thing to do. That's what l would do.
	我们要让他能够了解现实\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	We're not trying to confuse him, we're trying to make things easier,
	大家别再闹了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	so cut the comedy.
	我觉得这样做可爱多了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I am being serious, Dad. It's a much nicer thing to do.
	我们现在是要教他明辨是非\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Forget nice. We're talking right and wrong.
	别笑\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Shut up!
	难怪爱德华学不好\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Oh, goodness! No wonder poor Edward can't learn right from wrong, 
	住在我们这样的家庭\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	living in this family!
	你知他将碧姬家怎么了?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Well, did you hear what he did to Peg's curtains?
	他们还打算开圣诞舞会? 你要去吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	It's unbelievable they're having their party anyway. Are you going?
	我不想去\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I don't think so.
	其实他强暴了乔伊斯\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	He practically raped Joyce, threatening her with those knives.
	用他的剪刀来威胁她就范\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	It's a miracle she escaped.
	我不是怪比尔和碧姬\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I have nothing against Bill and Peg, but...
	但是他们家有一个未成年少女\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I know. They've got that teenage daughter in the house.
	可怜的孩子  我这么一出事后\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Those poor things! After what happened to me...
	你能想像吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Can you imagine?
	你说他们要办舞会?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	What did you say about the Christmas party?
	我说我可能会去\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I said I hoped we could make it.
	我也撒了同样的谎\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I lied too.
	你要替我剪新发型吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Edward? Do you want to give me that new haircut?
	-还要吗? -是的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Again? -Yeah, sure!
	我很荣幸有你这位个人发型师\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	It makes me proud to have you as my own personal hairdresser.
	-嗨  亲爱的  -嗨\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Hi, honey. -Hi.
	-你要不要玩包剪槌? -不\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Kevin, want to play scissors, paper, stone? -No.
	-为什么  -无聊死了我老是赢  我出去了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Why? -It's boring. I'm tired of always winning.
	-我要出去-你礼貌点\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-I'll be outside -A few manners!
	你不要介意  你剪吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Never you mind, dear. Just... cut away. Cut away.
	还要多添点什么呢?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	It needs something... else. What do you think, honey?
	-小钟? -再加小钟  好的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-More bells? -More bells. OK.
	妈  我们真要开舞会吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Mom, do you really think we should be having this party?
	当然是要办呀\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Of course I think we should be having this party.
	这样可让事情平静下来\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	It's just what we need to calm things down, 
	让一切回复正常\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	and... everything'll go back to normal. Hm?
	你还有小钟吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Do you have any more bells, honey?
	嘿\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Hey!
	看你做了什么\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Now you've done it.
	只是划了一道  没事的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	It's just a scratch, Jim, really. It's OK.
	-再碰她我就要你的命  -这没什么大不了的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Touch her again and I'll kill ya. -It's no big deal.
	-快叫医生  -不\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Call a doctor. He skewered Kim. -No!
	远离她  我说真的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Stay away from her. I mean it!
	你到处惹祸\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You can't touch anything without ruining it. 
	你为何还待在这里?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Why do you hang around here anyway?
	你坐下来  我去拿冰块来敷\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I want you to sit right down and wait for me to bring you some ice.
	我马上回来\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Stay right there. I'll be right back.
	圣诞的清晨里...\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	On Christmas day in the morning
	滚开\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Get the hell outta here!
	走  走呀  怪胎\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Get the hell out! Go! Freak!
	爱德华  你要去哪?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Hey, Edward, where are you goin'?
	他人呢?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Where is he?
	-他要伤害你  不  -他没有\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-He tried to hurt you. -He did not, and you know it.
	你疯了吗? 我亲眼看到的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Are you nuts? I just saw him!
	占美  我不爱你了  你走吧  走呀\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Jim, I don't love you any more. I just want you to go, OK? Just go!
	你说真的?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Are you serious?
	你因为他离开我\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	And lose you to that? He isn't even human.
	你滚吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Just get out of here, OK? Just go!
	爸  你看见他去那里吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Dad, did you see where Edward went?
	他沿着街走了下去\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I don't know. He just waltzed down the street.
	-我们得去找他  -叫你父亲去找他\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-We have to find him, Mom. -Your father will find him.
	进去  我来处理这事\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Go on in the house. I'll take care of it.
	我去找他\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I'll go find him.
	爱德华\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Edward!
	我要报警\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I'm calling the police!
	这只是一道小伤口\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	See all that blood, sweetie? And it's just a little cut.
	哦\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Oh!
	我是来找剪刀手的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Hello. I'm here to see the man with the hands.
	哦\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Ohh!
	-嗯  -他不在  谢谢\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Uh... -He's not here. Thank you.
	亲爱的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Oh, dear.
	你真的看见他?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Helen, did you actually see him?
	是的  你看\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Yes! Look!
	我是来找剪刀手的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I'm looking for the man with the scissors.
	-谢天谢地  你们来了  -他朝那边去了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Thank God you're here. -He went right down that way, sir.
	好  冷静  我们会处理的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	All right, calm down, calm down. Go on home. We'll handle it.
	回家去\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Just go home.
	-他是恶魔  -抓住他一定要抓住他\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-A... a demon. A demon. -You gotta do somethin'!
	你爸一定会找到他\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I'm sure your father'll find him soon.
	几点了?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	What time is it?
	八点半了  今天派对可真棒呀\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	It's almost 8.30. Great party, huh?
	他们去了哪里?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Mom, where are they?
	-天啊  -希望他没事  -我也希望\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-God, I hope he's OK. -So do I, honey.
	当我把爱德华带回家\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	You know, when I brought Edward down here to live with us,
	我实在没好好考虑清楚\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I really didn't think things through.
	也没想到他会发生何事\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	And I didn't think about what could happen to him.
	或者我们会如何? 或对邻居们\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Or to us. Or to the neighbourhood.
	现在我觉得也许...\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	And now I think that maybe...
	他回去会比较好\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	it might be best if he goes... back up there.
	因为至少他在上面比较安全\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Because at least there he's safe.
	我们的生活再回复正常\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	And we'd just... go back to normal.
	我几乎走到街尾  都没看见他\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I got halfway to the Whitmans'. I didn't see him anywhere.
	我们驾车去找他\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Let's get in the car and go look for him.
	-凯文呢? -他在麦家\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Where's Kevin now? -At Max's.
	上帝啊\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Oh, for God's sakes!
	-你要去那里? -跟你们去\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Where do you think you're goin'? -With you guys.
	-你在家等  如果有人来的话  -我们马上回来\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-You stay here in case somebody shows up. -We'll be right back, dear.
	警察\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Police!
	爱德华\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Edward?
	你没事吧?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Are you OK?
	没事  你呢?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Yes. Are you OK?
	大家都去哪里了?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Where is everybody?
	出去找你\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Out looking for you.
	抱我\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Hold me.
	我不能\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I can't.
	我知离圣诞节还很早\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I know it's a little early for Christmas, Edward, but...
	但我有礼物给你\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	I have a present for you.
	他连她的手都碰不了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Forget holding her hand.
	你想他会对她造成什么伤害?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Picture the damage he could do other places.
	真呕心\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Yeah. That's sick.
	我真的快吐了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Ugh! I feel like I'm gonna pass out or puke or something.
	等一会  先载我到她家去\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Later. First, take me to her house.
	占美别叫我开车了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Come on. Don't make me drive.
	快开\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Just do it!
	她真是说得没错\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Jesus. Maybe she was right about you.
	-快开车  -放松\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Just drive! -Relax!
	-明天见  -好的\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-See you tomorrow. Call me. -All right.
	抓到他了吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Have they caught him yet?
	-谁? -他  那个残障呀\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Who? -Him! That... that cripple.
	抓到了通知我一声\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Let me know when they do.
	通知大家  好吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Let us all know, OK?
	做个乖孩子\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Like a good boy.
	凯文\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Kevin.
	-Urgh  -你没事吧?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Urgh! -Are you OK?
	-没事  -哦\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-It's OK. -Ow!
	哦\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Ow! Ow!
	-爱德华  住手  -我是你的朋友\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Edward, stop! -I'm your friend.
	救命\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Somebody help us!
	你在做什么? 放开他\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	What are you doing? Get away from him!
	嘿\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Hey...
	-放开我  -什么?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Let go of me! -What?
	凯文\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Kevin!
	-走开  -爱德华  回家\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-Get away! -Edward, come home. Come home!
	快逃\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Run.
	凯文没事  只是划伤\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Kevin's all right! It was just the tiniest scratch!
	他走了  放他走算了\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	He's gone. Let's not bother him, all right? Let's just leave him alone.
	你快逃吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	Go on, run.
	-怎么了? -他死了吗?\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	-What happened? ls he dead? -Did you get him?
	结束了  你们都回家吧\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs14}
	It's all over. Go on home. There's nothing more to see.

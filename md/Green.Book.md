	我之前当兵的时候被分配到德国\N
	Yeah, I was stationed in Germany in the army.
	我能听懂你们说的一部分话\N
	I can pick up a little bit of what you're saying there.
	你要小心德国佬\N
	Watch out for them Krauts.
	他们都是蛇蝎心肠\N
	They're all snakes.
	肯尼迪当初就应该把他们全炸死\N
	Kennedy shoulda bombed 'em when he had the chance.
	还有现在那群古巴暴民\N
	Plus now them Cuban bastards.
	难道他们不应该跟着我们吗\N
	Ain't they supposed to be following us?
	他们也有行程  只要能准时赶到演出现场\N
	They have the itinerary. As long as they get to the show
	我就不担心  你也不必担心\N
	on time, I am not worried about it and neither should you.
	我完全不担心\N
	I ain't worried about nothing.
	我告诉你  我担心的时候  你能看出来\N
	Fact, when you see me worried, you'll know.
	-你绝对能看出来  -托尼  能不能安静一会儿\N
	- You'll know if I'm worried. - Tony. How about some quiet time?
	当然\N
	Sure.
	你居然说了这句话\N
	It's amazing you said that.
	能不能安静一会儿\N
	How about some quiet time?
	德洛丽丝  我老婆  她以前总这么说\N
	Dolores, my wife, she used to say that all time, 
	也不是总这么说吧  但是有时候\N
	well not all the time, but you know...
	我下班回来的时候她就会这样说\N
	She says it when I come off from work some time,
	因为她陪了孩子们一整天\N
	you know, she's been with the kids all that day.
	她就会说  托尼  能不能安静一会儿\N
	And she would say, Tony... How about some quite time?
	跟你刚才的语气一样\N
	Exactly like how you said it.
	真的  太神奇了\N
	I mean... it's amazing.
	怎么样\N
	How was that?
	很咸\N
	Salty.
	你有没有考虑过当美食评论家\N
	Have you ever considered becoming a food critic?
	没  没有啊\N
	No... Not really.

	Why? Is there money in it?
	我只是觉得\N
	I'm just saying, you have a
	你描述食物的词汇很不可思议\N
	marvelous way with words when describing food.
	很咸\N
	Salty!
	太生动了  让人几乎能尝到\N
	So vivid. One can almost taste it.
	我只是说很咸\N
	I'm saying it's salty.
	盐属于作弊行为\N
	And salt's cheating.
	任何厨师都能把食物做咸  但是不加盐\N
	Any cook can make things salty. But to make it taste
	还能做得很好吃  做出其他香味\N
	good without the salt, with just the other flavors

	that's the trick. 
	我们得尽快出发了\N
	We should really get going soon

	When I was in the army
	认识一个匹兹堡来的人\N
	I knew a guy from Pittsburgh
	但是他称之为奶子堡\N
	except he called it Tits-burgh
	他说那里的女人奶子都很大\N
	he said all the women there have huge tits.
	太荒谬了\N
	That's absurd.
	为什么匹兹堡的女人\N
	Why would women in Pittsburgh
	会比纽约的女人胸部大呢\N
	have larger breasts than, say, women in New York?
	很快我们就能一探究竟了\N
	Guess we'll find out, huh?
	其实  你最开始雇用我的时候\N
	You know, when you first hired me
	我老婆买了一张你的唱片\N
	my wife went out bought one of your records,
	关于孤儿的那个\N
	one about the orphans.
	孤儿\N
	Orphans?
	对  封面上有一群小孩坐在篝火边\N
	Yeah. Cover had a bunch of kids sitting around a campfire?
	那是奥菲斯
	[发音类似]{\fs}\N{\fs9\b0\shad1\c&H0061FF&\3c&H202020&}Orpheus.
	对\N
	Yeah.
	《地狱中的奥菲斯》  根据法国歌剧创作的\N
	Orpheus in the Underworld. It's based on a French Opera.
	而且封面上也不是小孩\N
	And those weren't children on the cover.
	都是地狱里的恶魔\N

	谢谢\N
	Oh, thanks.
	还有一件事\N
	One more thing.
	音乐会前后  我们会参加许多活动\N
	We will be attending many events before and after the concerts
	会接触到全国上下\N
	interacting with some of
	一些很富有也很有修养的人们\N
	the wealthiest and most highly-educated people in the country.
	我觉得你有时候的措辞\N
	It is my feeling that your diction
	也许在三州地区很有魅力  但是在这里...\N
	however charming it may be in the tri-state area, could use some
	有待提高\N
	finessing.
	你说的措辞  是什么意思\N
	You mean diction, like in what way?
	措辞这个词  还能有什么意思\N
	Like in the only way the word is ever used.
	好\N
	Okay.
	你的语气  音调  还有词语的选择\N
	Your intonation, inflection, your choice of words.
	我自己的麻烦就够多了  现在还要操心\N

	我他妈不需要你帮忙\N
	I don't need no goddamn help.
	有人不喜欢我说话的方式  那就自己玩蛋去\N
	People don't like the way I talk, they can go take a shit.
	你的粗口也是一个问题\N
	The profanity is another issue.
	妈了个巴子  你找我茬干什么\N
	A fanabla, why you breaking my balls?
	因为你可以做到更好  瓦莱隆加先生\N
	Because you can do better. Mr Vallelonga.
	这让我想到另一件事\N

	as the guest of honor, 
	我参加这些活动时会被介绍\N
	I will be introduced when entering these intimate events.
	他们也会介绍你\N
	You will be introduced as well.
	我个人认为\N
	In my humble opinion
	瓦莱隆加可能有点难发音\N
	Vallelonga may be difficult to pronounce.
	所以我觉得...\N
	So, I was thinking...
	瓦莱可能更好些  托尼·瓦莱\N
	Valle would be more appropriate. Tony Valle.
	简单又干练\N
	Short and sweet.
	不行\N
	Nah!
	要是对瓦莱隆加有意见  可以叫我托尼· 利普\N
	If they got a problem with Vallelonga, they can call me Tony Lip.
	这些都是上流人士  托尼·利普可能有点...\N
	These are genteel people. Tony Lip might be a little...
	太世俗了\N
	worldly for them.
	那就叫我托尼·瓦莱隆加\N
	Well, then it's Tony Vallelonga.
	这些高档人士\N
	All these high-class people,
	比我聪明那么多  他们那么有智慧\N
	so much smarter than me, with their intelligence
	那么会说话\N
	and speaking abilities,
	难道还叫不出我的名字吗\N
	you're telling me they can't pronounce my name?
	他们要是不喜欢\N
	They don't like it, they can
	那就给老子憋着  我在外面等就好\N
	shove it up their ass, I'll just wait outside.
	这算是个办法\N
	That sound compromised.

	我今天晚上看到谢利医生弹钢琴了\N
	I saw Dr. Shirley play the piano. Tonight.
	他弹琴的感觉不像黑人\N
	He doesn't play like a colored guy.
	他弹得像利伯雷斯  甚至更好
	[美国钢琴家]{\fs}\N{\fs9\b0\shad1\c&H0061FF&\3c&H202020&}He plays like Liberace but better.
	他应该是个天才吧\N

	我和谢利医生相处得很好  但有时候\N
	Dr. Shirley and I are getting along pretty good, but sometimes
	他会很悲伤  因此他总是买醉\N
	I think he gets sad and that's why he drinks too much.
	我以前从不知道这个国家有多美\N

	I have a brother somewhere.
	我们以前经常聚在一起...\N
	We used to get together once in a while...
	但后来越来越难保持联系\N
	but it got more and more difficult to stay in touch.
	这大概是做音乐家的诅咒吧\N
	Curse of being a musician I guess.
	总是四处奔波\N
	Always on the road
	就像狂欢节工作者一样\N
	like a carnival worker.
	或是罪犯\N
	Or a criminal.
	我的婚姻也受到了很大的影响\N
	Took quite a toll on my marriage as well.

	不幸的是  我没能做好\N
	Unfortunately, I couldn't
	一个丈夫和一个音乐会钢琴演奏家\N
	do a husband act and a concert pianist act.
	我似乎不能兼顾这两个角色\N
	Couldn't seem to manage both worlds.
	肯德基\N
	Kentucky Fried Chicken.
	就在肯塔基州  你说巧不巧\N
	In Kentucky! When's that ever gonna happen?!
	好吧\N
	All right!
	你要吃什么吗\N
	Hey, you want some?
	不用了  谢谢你  托尼\N
	I'm fine. Thank you Tony.
	我觉得这是我吃过最好吃的肯德基\N
	I think this is the best Kentucky Fried Chicken I ever had.
	我猜这里的更新鲜  对吧\N
	But I guess it's fresher down here, right?
	我从没见过像你这么有胃口的人\N
	I don't think I've ever met anyone with your appetite.
	不  我买了一桶  你可以尝尝\N
	No, I've bought the bucket so you could have some.
	我这辈子从没吃过炸鸡\N

	炸鸡  粗燕麦粉  五颜六色的蔬菜\N
	the fried chicken, the grits, the colored greens
	我也很喜欢\N
	I love it, too.
	我在军队的时候  黑人厨师总是做这些吃的\N
	The negro cooks used to make it all time when I was in the army.
	你对我的评价很狭隘  托尼\N
	You have a very narrow assessment of me, Tony.
	对吧  我很厉害\N
	Yeah right? I'm good.
	不  你不是厉害  是糟糕\N
	No, you're not good, you're bad.
	我的意思是  别的黑人\N
	I'm saying, just because
	喜欢听某种类型的音乐\N
	other Negros enjoy certain types of music,
	不代表我就必须喜欢\N
	it doesn't mean I have to.
	也不代表我们都吃同一种食物\N
	Nor do we all have to eat the same kind food.

	但只要我一下台\N
	But as soon as I step off that stage
	我又变回了那个他们不屑一顾的黑鬼\N
	I go right back to being just another nigger to them.
	因为那才是他们真正的文化\N
	Because that is their true culture.
	而我只能独自承受这种轻蔑\N
	And I suffer that slight alone,
	因为我不被自己人所接受\N
	because I'm not accepted by my own people,
	因为我跟他们也不是一类人\N
	because I'm not like them either!
	如果我不够黑人  也不够白人\N

	要不也给你的兄弟写封信\N
	maybe you should write one to your brother?
	他要是想联系我  他知道我住哪\N
	He knows where I am if he ever wants to reconnect.
	要是我就不愿意等\N
	If... I wouldn't wait.
	这世上到处都是\N
	You know... the world's full
	害怕主动迈出第一步的孤独之人\N
	of lonely people afraid to make the first move.
	我明天再写吧\N
	Yeah, I'll finish this tomorrow.
	其实医生  这一路上我一直有件事没想通\N
	You know Doc, something's been eating at me this whole trip.
	"奶子堡"太让我失望了\N

1
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,249
女孩子永远不会忘记自己喜欢上的第一个男孩
A girl will never forget the first boy she likes.

2
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:25,667
即使事情不尽人意
Even if things don't quite work out.

3
00:00:26,913 --> 00:00:28,189
为什么推我?
Why did you do that?

4
00:00:28,543 --> 00:00:30,365
因为你闻起来像狗便便
Because you smell like dog poo.

5
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:33,146
你蠢得像狗便便
You're so stupid, just like dog poo.

6
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:34,651
你是狗便便做的!
You're made out of poo!

7
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:39,158
但总有人为你排疑解惑
<i>But usually someone is there
to offer words of wisdom.</i>

8
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,510
狗...
Made...

9
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:41,977
... 便便...
...of...

10
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,713
... 做...
...dog...

11
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:45,151
... 的
...poo.

12
00:00:45,314 --> 00:00:46,551
亲爱的
Honey...

13
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:51,739
... 知道为什么那男孩要那样做 那样说吗?
...do you know why that little boy
did those things and said those things?

14
00:00:51,902 --> 00:00:53,656
因为他喜欢你
It's because he likes you.

15
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:55,958
就是这个
<i>GIGl:
And there it is.</i>

16
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,642
这就是我们问题的开始
<i>That's the beginning of our problem.</i>

17
00:00:59,582 --> 00:01:04,693
那个小男孩欺负你 是因为他喜欢你
That little boy is doing those terrible
things because he's got a crush on you.

18
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,141
知道这意味着什么吗?
<i>GIGl:
Do you know what this means?</i>

19
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,378
我们被鼓励...
<i>We're all encouraged...</i>

20
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,663
... 不 被设计...
<i>...no, programmed...</i>

21
00:01:08,826 --> 00:01:11,252
...去相信 如果一个小子做了令你伤心的事
<i>...to believe that if a guy
acts like a total jerk...</i>

22
00:01:11,415 --> 00:01:13,783
... 就表示他喜欢你
<i>...that means he likes you.</i>

23
00:01:16,247 --> 00:01:18,673
问题就在这儿: 他太喜欢你了
Here's the problem:
He likes you too much.

24
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:20,629
而你太漂亮太能干
You're too pretty and too awesome.

25
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:22,797
- 嗯  - 他不知所措
- Yes.
- He can't handle it.

26
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,696
那个Phi Delt显然很喜欢你
That Phi Delt so obviously liked you.

27
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:29,969
我相信他只是弄丢了你的号码
I'm sure he just lost your number.

28
00:01:31,446 --> 00:01:35,856
他不约你是因为 他被你成功的事业吓到了
He's not asking you out because he's
intimidated by your professional success.

29
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,041
相信我 因为他刚结束了一段认真的感情
Trust me. It's because he's just
getting out of a serious relationship.

30
00:01:49,616 --> 00:01:53,068
相信我，这是因为他从来没有过认真的感情
Trust me. It's because he's never had
a serious relationship.

31
00:02:05,102 --> 00:02:06,991
为什么我们这样互相宽慰?
<i>GIGl:
Why do we say this stuff to each other?</i>

32
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:10,472
难道因为我们太害怕...
<i>Is it possible that it's because
we're too scared...</i>

33
00:02:10,644 --> 00:02:13,703
... 太难说出那个...
<i>...and it's too hard to say
the one obvious truth...</i>

34
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:16,743
显而易见的事实?
<i>...that's staring everyone in the face?</i>

35
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:34,846
Janine说你是个房地产经纪人
So Janine says
you're a real-estate agent.

36
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:37,157
对 不过我不在公交椅或商店推车上...
Yeah, but I'm not
one of those cheesy ones...

37
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,139
... 贴大头广告 那太低级
...that puts my headshots on bus benches
and grocery carts.

38
00:02:40,302 --> 00:02:42,537
你贴在飞盘或笔记本上?
So just, like, Frisbees and notepads?

39
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,678
差不多
Basically.

40
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,672
- 高级多了  - 正是如此
- It's much classier.
- My thoughts exactly.

41
00:02:49,258 --> 00:02:51,780
为什么Janine不早点介绍我们认识
Wonder why Janine never thought
to introduce us before.

42
00:02:51,943 --> 00:02:53,640
不知道 不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

43
00:02:53,803 --> 00:02:56,738
- 嗨 伙计们 再来一杯?  - 想再来杯吗?
- Hey, guys. Want another round?
- You want one more?

44
00:02:57,869 --> 00:03:02,817
除非你也喝 如果你想喝 我可以...
Only if you do. I mean,
if you need to get going, I totally...

45
00:03:04,073 --> 00:03:05,214
嗯...
Uh...

46
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:07,870
好吧...
Okay, well...

47
00:03:09,385 --> 00:03:10,938
再来个加苏打的伏特加?
Sure. One more. Ketel and soda?

48
00:03:11,782 --> 00:03:13,307
还有啤酒 谢谢
And a beer, please.

49
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,263
稍等
Be right back.

50
00:03:16,193 --> 00:03:20,057
- Conor 今晚很愉快  - 认识你很高兴
Well, Conor, I had a really nice time.
- It was really nice meeting you.

51
00:03:20,777 --> 00:03:22,560
- 再见  - 再见
- Bye.
- See you.

52
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:31,449
喂 是我
Hey, it's me.

53
00:03:31,621 --> 00:03:33,951
他很可爱 进展很顺利
He's cute, and I think it went well.

54
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:38,487
我想这会儿 他正往我家电话留言呢
And I think he might be leaving me
a message at home as we speak.

55
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,553
喂 是我 我只想告诉你我想你
Hey, it's me. Just wanted to let you know
I was thinking about you.

56
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:45,525
Conor 你真好 谢谢
Oh, that's very sweet of you,
Conor. Thanks.

57
00:03:45,698 --> 00:03:48,565
那个 你想不想吃个夜宵
Listen, I was wondering if you
wanted to grab a late bite.

58
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:51,163
今晚? 我...
Tonight? I...

59
00:03:51,326 --> 00:03:55,219
不行 我本来要见朋友 但我太累了 别生气
No, I was supposed to meet friends
but I'm burnt out. Don't be mad at me.

60
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:57,914
我没生气 我会晚点睡
<i>No, of course, I'm not mad.
Well, I'll be up for a while.</i>

61
00:03:58,077 --> 00:03:59,899
- 你先来吧?  - 我等你
<i>- Do you wanna go ahead of me?
- I'll be up.</i>

62
00:04:00,062 --> 00:04:01,270
- 先别挂?  - 好
<i>- Oh, can you hold on?
- Okay.</i>

63
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:03,542
不用 你只买了一样东西...
No, that's fine.
You just have one thing, so...

64
00:04:03,705 --> 00:04:05,431
严格说 买了六瓶...
No, technically I have six...

65
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:09,008
... 我还在琢磨要不要买口香糖 所以你先吧
...and I'm mulling over a gum purchase,
so I think you should go.

66
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:10,485
好吧
Okay.

67
00:04:10,648 --> 00:04:11,865
待会儿打给你
Let me call you right back.

68
00:04:12,028 --> 00:04:13,006
好的
<i>All right. Okay.</i>

69
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:14,809
- 嗨  - 你好
- Hi.
- Hey.

70
00:04:14,972 --> 00:04:17,043
就这些 谢谢
Just that and that, please.

71
00:04:17,206 --> 00:04:18,971
谢谢
Thank you.

72
00:04:23,094 --> 00:04:24,407
噢 不会吧
Oh, my word.

73
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,543
啊? 不可能啊
Seriously? That's not possible.

74
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:30,602
我三天前才存了款 不可能爆卡
I just deposited cash three days ago,
so it's just not possible.

75
00:04:30,774 --> 00:04:33,459
不是说那个 我查查
Oh, it's not that.
Let me check something.

76
00:04:34,236 --> 00:04:35,540
恭喜 你中了
Congratulations, you won.

77
00:04:36,499 --> 00:04:37,487
什么?
What?

78
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:41,552
本店秋季促销活动 你是本月第1000位顾客
Our Funky Fall promotion.
You're our 1000th customer this month.

79
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,211
啊?
What?

80
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:49,741
不是开玩笑吧?
Are you kidding me?

81
00:04:50,393 --> 00:04:51,985
我不开玩笑
I don't do kidding.

82
00:04:52,982 --> 00:04:55,667
上帝 我简直不敢相信 太棒了
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this, it's so exciting.

83
00:04:56,472 --> 00:04:59,761
天呐 我从没中过奖
Oh, my God.
I never won anything before.

84
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:03,223
这竟是我有生以来最高兴的事 挺悲哀吧
This is the most exciting thing
that ever happened to me. Is that sad?

85
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:06,186
是... 不 不是
Yea- No. I don't think so.

86
00:05:06,358 --> 00:05:08,660
- 真的?  - 嗯
- Really?
- Yes.

87
00:05:08,813 --> 00:05:10,788
谢谢! 过来
Thank you! Come here.

88
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:13,185
哇
Wow.

89
00:05:15,822 --> 00:05:17,836
Terps跑到中场 想进攻
<i>- as the Terps move
to mid-ice, trying to...</i>

90
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:19,754
- 嗨  - 嗨
- Hey.
- Hey.

91
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:22,765
- 约会怎样?  - 凑合 管它呢
- How was the date?
- It was fine. Whatever.

92
00:05:22,928 --> 00:05:24,817
- 你怎么在这儿?  - 我的闭路断台了了
- Why are you here?
- My cable's out.

93
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,173
Come on, Spiewak,
it's not the Ice Capades.

94
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:30,982
电话铃有响过吗?
You didn't hear the phone ring
by any chance, did you?

95
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:33,389
- 没有  - 见鬼
- No, I didn't.
- Shit.

96
00:05:33,552 --> 00:05:36,131
Anna老是那句"呆会儿打给你"
Anna gave me the old,
"I'll call you right back. "

97
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:38,279
噢 见鬼, 是吗?   多久前?
Oh, shit, yeah? Well, how long ago?

98
00:05:38,442 --> 00:05:42,057
22分钟前
That was 22 minutes ago.

99
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:43,869
我打给她怎样?
Do I call back?

100
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:46,046
你要打给她? 千万不要!
Should you call back? No, absolutely not.

101
00:05:47,273 --> 00:05:49,575
我就告诉她 我要上床睡觉了
I'm gonna call back
and say I'm going to bed.

102
00:05:49,738 --> 00:05:52,384
别 才9:30 你就...?
What? No. It's 9:30. You're gonna-?

103
00:05:52,557 --> 00:05:53,669
不 这是个好主意
No, it's a great idea.

104
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:56,738
打给她说 "不用给我打电话了...
I'll call and say, "In case you were
gonna call me back, don't...

105
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,943
... 因为我要睡了" 绝妙的主意
...because I'll be sleeping. "
A genius idea.

106
00:05:59,116 --> 00:06:00,324
对 妙极了
Okay, no, that's brilliant.

107
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:03,555
睡醒后再打电话给她 "我醒了 可以接你的电话了"
When you wake up you can say, "I'm awake
now, I'm available to take your call. "

108
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:06,652
噢 稍等
Oh, gosh. A second.

109
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,155
- 很抱歉  - 没关系
- Sorry about that.
- It's all right.

110
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,389
我...
I was-

111
00:06:11,562 --> 00:06:13,278
我说到哪儿了?
Wait, what was I saying again?

112
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,289
你不愿像你母亲那样 一天醒来...
You don't wanna be like your mother,
wake up one morning...

113
00:06:16,452 --> 00:06:18,312
... 发现自己从未追求过梦想
...and realize
you never pursued your dreams.

114
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:19,683
我这样说了?
Is that what I was saying?

115
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,409
- 来点口香糖?  - 不 谢谢
- You want some gum?
- No, thank you.

116
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:25,245
上帝 我竟然谈那么沉重的话题
God, that's kind of heavy
for a grocery chat.

117
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:27,546
- 没关系  - 是吗?
- No, that's okay.
- Isn't it?

118
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:30,049
- 对不起  - 或许我能帮到你
- Sorry.
- I actually might be able to help.

119
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:34,306
我有个朋友专门接手音乐方面的客户
Yeah, I know a guy at my office
who deals exclusively with music clients.

120
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:35,514
- 你开玩笑吧?  - 嗯哼
- Are you kidding?
- Uh-uh.

121
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,279
噢 上帝
Oh, my God.

122
00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:39,647
- 你是我的救世主还是什么?  - 不
- Are you my savior or something?
- No.

123
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,524
- 帮我拿一下?  - 好
- Can you hold this for a second?
- Yeah.

124
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:45,631
太出人意料了
Oh, this is so unexpected.

125
00:06:56,859 --> 00:06:58,393
好了...
Okay...

126
00:06:58,556 --> 00:06:59,544
我不能...
I don't...

127
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:01,826
我有老婆
I'm married.

128
00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:04,022
我不能这样做
I don't do this.

129
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:07,387
你不怎样做? 不帮助困境中的歌手?
You don't do what?
You don't help struggling singers?

130
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:14,301
不帮性感的瑜伽教练...
Not hot yoga-instructing singers...

131
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:17,206
...而且还相当迷人
...who are incredibly charming.

132
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:21,368
嗯
Hm.

133
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:25,079
你可以... 给我你的名片
Well, you could-
You could give me your card.

134
00:07:25,242 --> 00:07:27,543
这很合法 对吗? 可以吗?
That's legit, right? Is that allowed?

135
00:07:27,706 --> 00:07:28,751
可以
I could do that.

136
00:07:28,924 --> 00:07:30,611
- 耶  - 那没问题?
- Yeah.
- That'd be okay, right?

137
00:07:30,774 --> 00:07:32,366
好吧
Yeah.

138
00:07:34,677 --> 00:07:35,952
很好 非常感谢
Great, thank you so much.

139
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,774
没关系 要帮你拎上车吗?
Course. Do you need help to your car?

140
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:40,114
- 你的车在哪儿?  - 不用 我自己来
- Where'd you park?
- No, I'm fine. It's okay.

141
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,384
- 认识你很高兴  - 嗯
- It was very nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

142
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,138
好了
Okay.

143
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:57,709
她是谁?
Who was that?

144
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:02,858
- 一个潜在的客户  - 哦
- Oh, that was a prospective client.
- Oh.

145
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:05,064
不错
Okay.

146
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:09,101
我和一个女孩说说话 你用不着这样吧
I can talk to a woman.
It doesn't have to be like that.

147
00:08:09,264 --> 00:08:11,086
我没有
No. Absolutely not.

148
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:14,384
- 开车吧  - 别紧张
- Just drive.
- Relax.

149
00:08:32,142 --> 00:08:34,444
- 嗨  - 嗨
- Hi.
- Hi.

150
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:36,678
- 你好吗  - 很好
- How you doing?
- Good.

151
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:39,689
- 是吗?  - 是啊 我刚讲完电话
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I just got off the phone.

152
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,798
- 是吗?  - 是啊 跟我妹妹
- Yeah?
- Yeah, with my little sister.

153
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:44,742
- 她好吗?  - 她要结婚了
- How's she doing?
- She's getting married.

154
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,602
真的?
Really?

155
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:48,108
是的
Yeah.

156
00:08:48,271 --> 00:08:49,345
很好啊
Great.

157
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:50,860
你真觉得好?
You really think that's great?

158
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:52,547
是的
Yeah.

159
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,753
Devon看起来...
Devon seems like...

160
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:56,584
...是个很好的男人
...a great guy.

161
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:02,213
他们结婚了 你觉得很好...
Well, so you think it's great
that they're getting married...

162
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:07,592
... 而我们还没结婚...
...but you don't ever feel like
we're going against nature, or something...

163
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,989
... 你却不觉得违背自然规律?
...by not getting married?

164
00:09:11,523 --> 00:09:12,578
不觉得
No.

165
00:09:13,163 --> 00:09:17,794
猫给猴子喂奶 才是违背自然规律
Going against nature
is like the cat who suckled that monkey.

166
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:22,052
你我只是两个 碰巧都不结婚的人
You and I are just two people
who happen not to be married.

167
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:25,638
告诉你吧 结了婚就不再互相信任了
Let me tell you something. People
who get married are not to be trusted.

168
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:27,901
你真古怪
You are so weird.

169
00:09:28,074 --> 00:09:29,243
真的 知道原因吗?
They're not. You know why?

170
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,034
因为如果你真正的快乐并忠诚于对方...
Because if you are so legitimately happy,
honestly...

171
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,786
... 你就不会去搞个婚礼什么的展示一番
...you wouldn't feel the need
to make a big show out of it.

172
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,569
不用到处去告诉人家
You wouldn't have to broadcast it.

173
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,429
他们结婚是因为没信心...
They do it because they're insecure...

174
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:41,690
... 他们认为结婚是必须做的事
...and they think getting married's
what they're supposed to be doing.

175
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:44,317
他们在欺骗自己和别人
So they're lying to themselves
and to other people.

176
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,755
真的
Seriously.

177
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,150
想想你和你的朋友 好吗?
Think about you and your friends.
Okay?

178
00:09:49,313 --> 00:09:51,422
你们有着非常深厚的友谊...
These women you have
great relationships with...

179
00:09:51,585 --> 00:09:54,337
... 你们相识多年 关系亲密
...you're close to them,
some of them you've known for years.

180
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,871
但你们不会...
But you don't feel the need...

181
00:09:56,034 --> 00:10:01,251
...花45美元去马里兰州签一张友谊证书
...to write a $45 check to the state
of Maryland for a friendship certificate.

182
00:10:01,404 --> 00:10:02,996
- 嗯 不会 我懂你的意思了 - 对吧?
- Yeah. No, I get that.
- Right?

183
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:06,103
这和你我之间又有什么区别呢?
Why should it be any different,
you know, with me and you?

184
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:09,718
我们很幸福 我爱你 我属于你...
We're very happy, I love you,
I'm committed to you...

185
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,028
... 我们生活很好 不是吗?
...we have a great life, you know?

186
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:13,170
对 你是对的
Yes, you're right.

187
00:10:13,342 --> 00:10:16,305
为什么不就这样幸福下去呢?
Why can't we just be happy?

188
00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:18,069
你是对的
You're right.

189
00:10:18,232 --> 00:10:20,725
- 我再给你倒些茶  - 好
- I'm gonna get you some more tea.
- Okay.

190
00:10:28,473 --> 00:10:30,544
请输入密码...
<i>Please enter your pass-</i>

191
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:32,174
您没有留言
<i>You have no messages.</i>

192
00:10:32,347 --> 00:10:34,169
主菜单 发送留言请按...
<i>Main menu. To send a message-</i>

193
00:10:37,084 --> 00:10:39,951
好吧 看来他没给你打过电话
Okay, so clearly he hasn't called.

194
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:41,840
也许他出差去了
Maybe he's away on business.

195
00:10:42,012 --> 00:10:44,908
他卖房子 就在巴尔的摩
He sells real estate. In Baltimore.

196
00:10:45,081 --> 00:10:47,315
- 呆在这城里就是他的工作  - 嗯
- Staying in town is his business.
- Right.

197
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:49,137
好啦 我跟你说
Well, look, let me tell you.

198
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,915
我和Ben初次约会后 他11天没联系过我
After I went out with Ben for the first
time, he didn't call me for 11 days.

199
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:55,504
11天呐 现在他还不是成了我的好丈夫
Eleven days. And now
he's the world's best husband.

200
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:56,818
这样的事多着呐
That happens all the time.

201
00:10:56,981 --> 00:10:58,160
- 真的吗?  - 真的
- Really?
- Really.

202
00:10:58,611 --> 00:11:00,365
来杯咖啡?
You want coffee?

203
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:02,897
- 给你加低脂牛奶  - 谢谢
- I got you 2 percent.
- Thanks.

204
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,746
这都怪你
This is all your fault.

205
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,673
啊? 为什么?
What? Why?

206
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,294
你介绍我们认识的
You set us up.

207
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:18,066
是你问我有没认识的人 我就给了Conor你的电话
No. You asked me if I know any guys,
and I gave Conor your phone number.

208
00:11:18,229 --> 00:11:19,783
这可不是撮合
That's not a setup.

209
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:22,640
我要撮合两个人 会先权衡利弊
When I do a setup,
I weigh the pros and cons.

210
00:11:22,803 --> 00:11:24,778
采取适当行动
I do my due diligence.

211
00:11:24,941 --> 00:11:29,218
关于Conor 我只知道他卖给我们这房子
All I know about Conor
is that he sold us this house.

212
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:35,009
说真的 别打
Seriously, stop.

213
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:38,605
他说他下班后常去城市夜总会
He said he always hangs out after work
at the City Supper Club.

214
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:40,907
也许我可以来个刚好路过?
Maybe I should do a little drive-by?

215
00:11:41,674 --> 00:11:42,987
别这样
Please don't.

216
00:11:43,946 --> 00:11:45,126
他会打给你的
He'll call.

217
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,384
好 我有个问题:
<i>Okay, I have a question:</i>

218
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:54,082
为什么要发明来电显示?
Why'd they even invent caller ID?

219
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:56,421
嗯 比如 这项服务对谁有用?
It's, like, who is this service helping?

220
00:11:56,584 --> 00:11:58,377
我指 几百年以来..
I mean, for centuries...

221
00:11:58,953 --> 00:12:02,472
也许没那么久 嗯 但很多很多年以前...
Okay, well maybe not centuries,
but for, like, a lot and lot of years...

222
00:12:02,635 --> 00:12:05,569
... 人们不知道打来电话的是谁...
...people have been answering their phone,
not knowing who it is...

223
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:08,072
而且据我所知 没人因为那样就活不下去
...and as far as I can tell,
no one's died from that.

224
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:12,741
再说如果警方要知道是谁打的电话 他们可以跟踪电话
And it's like if the police wanna know
who placed a call, they could trace it.

225
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:14,333
我是说 这样我就成了什么 警察吗?
I mean, what am I, the police?

226
00:12:14,506 --> 00:12:18,082
一定要知道电话是谁打来的这种心态
This constant obsession with needing
to know who's calling all the time...

227
00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:19,453
太讨厌了
...it's, like, so gross.

228
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:23,107
就比如 你拿起电话 看到是谁打来的 心里就明白了
Like, you pick up the phone,
you find out who it is, then you know.

229
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,679
这个 就像...
It's, like...

230
00:12:25,418 --> 00:12:27,201
听着 我想说的是...
Look, all I'm saying...

231
00:12:28,102 --> 00:12:31,775
如果一个男人没给我打电话 我可能会
...if a guy doesn't call me,
I would like to reserve the right...

232
00:12:31,938 --> 00:12:34,843
每隔15分钟就打给他一次 直到他接电话为止
...to call him at 15-minute intervals
until he picks up.

233
00:12:35,016 --> 00:12:37,049
但是 如果他低头看见是我的号码
But if he looks down
and sees my numbers...

234
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:40,386
他就会觉得我神经兮兮的
...he's gonna think
I'm some kind of psycho or something.

235
00:12:40,808 --> 00:12:42,591
但我并不是
Which I'm not.

236
00:12:42,754 --> 00:12:44,384
很明显
Obviously.

237
00:12:50,914 --> 00:12:52,669
喂?
Hello?

238
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:54,261
妈妈
Mom.

239
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:56,284
我等会儿再打给你
I gotta call you back.

240
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,762
吸气 天狗式动作
Inhale. Upward-facing dog.

241
00:13:00,925 --> 00:13:03,197
抬头看天花板
Look up towards the ceiling.

242
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,007
抬头看天花板
Look up towards the ceiling.

243
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:08,826
- 那个女侍应过来的时候他特地多点了几杯饮料  - 嗯
He ordered more drinks for us
when the waitress came.

244
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:10,849
他完全记得我想要什么
He remembered exactly what I wanted.

245
00:13:11,002 --> 00:13:13,390
他主动拥抱我 他说很高兴认识我
He initiated the hug.
He said it was nice meeting me.

246
00:13:13,563 --> 00:13:17,427
等一下 这是你们约会开始时还是约会结束时?
So wait. This was at the end of the date
or the beginning of the date?

247
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,805
约会结束时 怎么了 很重要吗?
End. Why, does it matter?

248
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:23,161
当然了 如果开始时说"很高兴认识你" 这很正常
Yeah. "Nice meeting you" at the beginning
of the date, that's normal.

249
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:25,491
但是结束时说"很高兴认识你"就...
"Nice meeting you"
at the end of the date...

250
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:27,476
就是没戏了
It could be a blowoff.

251
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,432
也可能是在约会开始时说的
Maybe it was at the beginning.

252
00:13:29,595 --> 00:13:32,529
好吧 那蛮好的 他会打给你的
Okay. That's fine. He's gonna call.

253
00:13:32,702 --> 00:13:34,073
也可能是结束时说的
Or maybe it was at the end.

254
00:13:34,236 --> 00:13:36,211
可能他就是很高兴认识我啊
Or maybe it was just nice to meet me.

255
00:13:36,374 --> 00:13:37,803
帮帮忙
Help.

256
00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:40,152
你好 这太折磨人了
Hi. This is torture.

257
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:43,125
我怎样才能精辟地准确地
How am I supposed to come up
with something pithy and dynamic...

258
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:44,697
介绍肉桂果物?
...to say about cinnamon blends?

259
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,260
我很难关注什么肉桂
It's hard to focus on nutmeg...

260
00:13:46,423 --> 00:13:48,753
这个男人 很可能是我的真命天子
...when the guy who might be
the guy of my dreams...

261
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,122
但他却没给我打电话
...refuses to call me.

262
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:53,778
我第一次和Neil约会之后
After my first date with Neil...

263
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:54,929
我主动打给他的
...I called him.

264
00:13:55,705 --> 00:13:57,776
已经没什么规定了
There are no rules anymore.

265
00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:01,391
还有 我是说 你干嘛非得等他主动出击?
And, I mean, why should you
have to wait for him to get off his ass?

266
00:14:05,716 --> 00:14:08,679
- 响了响了  - 电话通了就会响
- It's ringing.
- That's pretty standard.

267
00:14:08,851 --> 00:14:10,645
- 嘿 这里是Conor家  - 很好! 语音信箱
<i>- Hey, you've reached Conor.
- Yes! Voicemail.</i>

268
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,521
- 请留言 我会尽快回复你  - 笔记
<i>- Leave a message, I'll get back to you.
- Notes.</i>

269
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:15,439
"嘿 Conor 我是Gigi
"Hey, Conor, it's Gigi.

270
00:14:15,602 --> 00:14:17,491
我就是想 你没打电话给我
I just thought, I hadn't heard from you...

271
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:22,669
女人干嘛非得等男人打给她呢 不是吗?"
...and how stupid is it that a gal has
to wait for a guy's call anyway, right?"

272
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:26,629
这是什么意思? 这是什么意思?
<i>What does that say? What's that say?</i>

273
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:29,678
因为男女是平等的 对吗?
Because we're all equal, right?

274
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:31,625
而且不仅仅是平等
More than equal.

275
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,511
如今法学院女生可比男生多
More women are accepted
into law school now than men.

276
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:37,004
还有 我是说 不知道你看没看过"日界线"(美国一档爆料节目)
<i>And, I mean, I don't know
if you saw that Dateline...</i>

277
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,718
如今女人也可以有鸡鸡的 对吧? 那么...
...but women practically
have penises now, right? So...

278
00:14:40,782 --> 00:14:41,760
回电话给我
Call me.

279
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:44,301
哦 我是Gigi 回我电话
Oh, this is Gigi. Call me.

280
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:50,342
别担心 他肯定会打给你的
Don't worry, he's totally gonna call.

281
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:08,618
什么？
What?

282
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:11,945
电话怎么没声音? 电话怎么没声音?
How can there not be a dial tone?
How can there not be a dial tone?

283
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,429
没声音 回来吧 声音
No dial tone. Come here, dial tone.

284
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:15,781
Gigi 你在吗?
<i>Gigi, are you there?</i>

285
00:15:15,944 --> 00:15:17,258
在吗 Gigi?
<i>Hello, Gigi?</i>

286
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:18,792
- 妈 是你吗?  - 是啊
<i>- Mom, is that you?
- Yes.</i>

287
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:22,464
<i>- I can't talk now, I'll call you back.
- 我现在没法跟你说 等会儿回你电话  - 等一下 我想要你...
- Wait, I need you to-</i>

288
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,324
你好 我是Janine 请留言
<i>Hi, it's Janine. Leave a message.</i>

289
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,839
你好 Janine 是我
Hi, Janine, it's me.

290
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:34,076
Conor没打电话给我
Conor never called...

291
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:38,784
所以我想要正好路过下城市夜总会
...so I'm on the precipice of staging
a casual run-in at the City Supper Club.

292
00:15:38,947 --> 00:15:40,769
要阻止我就接电话
Pick up if you wanna stop me.

293
00:15:42,016 --> 00:15:45,631
好吧 我就当你默许了 拜拜
All right, I'm interpreting your silence
as tacit compliance. Bye.

294
00:15:49,763 --> 00:15:51,259
- 最近怎么样 小妞?  - 嘿
What's up, girl?
- Hey.

295
00:15:51,422 --> 00:15:53,503
- 你还好吗?  - 不错
- How are you?
- Good.

296
00:15:59,295 --> 00:16:00,340
打扰一下
Knock, knock.

297
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:01,826
嘿
Hey.

298
00:16:02,718 --> 00:16:04,127
那个...
So...

299
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:07,292
瞧瞧 我们又轮到同一班
...here we are. Same shift again.

300
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:11,549
我知道 我排的工作表 不记得了?
I know. I make the schedule. Remember?

301
00:16:11,712 --> 00:16:14,972
哦 我就猜这不是巧合
Well, I figured it was no coincidence.

302
00:16:19,163 --> 00:16:20,754
我...

I had...

303
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:22,941
那晚过得很开心
...a good time the other night.

304
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:24,532
是啊
Yeah.

305
00:16:24,705 --> 00:16:27,160
十杯龙舌兰酒下肚后你还真疯狂
It's amazing where 10 shots
of Patr will get you.

306
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,692
那个 我在想...
So I was thinking...

307
00:16:33,277 --> 00:16:35,828
下班后我们可以...
...after work we could...

308
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:37,813
你知道的...
You know...

309
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:44,237
听我说 Kelli Ann 那晚我们过得很开心
Look, Kelli Ann, what happened
between us the other night was fun.

310
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,522
真的很开心
It was definitely fun.

311
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:48,475
但今晚我们人手不够 我甚至要亲自掌管吧台
But we're way understaffed tonight.
I even have to man the bar.

312
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:51,534
所以我才安排你值班
So that's why I scheduled you.

313
00:16:51,707 --> 00:16:53,490
来工作
To work.

314
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:55,216
那么...
So...

315
00:16:57,498 --> 00:16:59,157
我们没事了?
Are we good?

316
00:17:00,538 --> 00:17:02,475
- 当然了 我们没事了  - 好的
- Nope, we're good.
- Okay.

317
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:03,827
嘿 哦 Kelli Ann
Hey, oh, Kelli Ann.

318
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,291
嘿 宝贝 能把门关一下吗? 谢谢
Hey, babe, could you get the door?
Thanks.

319
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,092
你好 是来吃晚餐的 还是?
Hi. Are you joining us for dinner, or...?

320
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:20,531
我来见个人 一个男人
I'm meeting someone. A guy.

321
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:22,094
- 何必呢?  - 嗯?
Why?
- Hm?

322
00:17:22,257 --> 00:17:24,050
没什么 抱歉 来吃饭?
Nothing. Sorry. For dinner?

323
00:17:25,747 --> 00:17:26,725
我在吧台等他
I'll wait at the bar.

324
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:29,707
主意不错
That's a great idea.

325
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:39,056
需要点什么?
What can I get you?

326
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:40,561
哦 不用了 我来见个人
Oh, no, I'm meeting someone.

327
00:17:40,715 --> 00:17:43,304
哦 是嘛? 所谓的燃情约会么?
Oh yeah? What, you got a hot date?

328
00:17:44,244 --> 00:17:45,931
我不知道能不能算得上"燃情"
I don't know if you'd call it "hot. "

329
00:17:46,094 --> 00:17:48,261
Conor和我才约了一次会...
This guy Conor and I
have only been out one time-

330
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,958
等等等一下 Conor Barry?
Wait, wait, wait. Conor Barry?

331
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,368
是的
Yeah.

332
00:17:51,531 --> 00:17:53,439
Conor今晚不会来了 谢谢
Conor's not coming in tonight.
Thanks a lot.

333
00:17:53,612 --> 00:17:56,066
他忘记约了你在这里见面吗?
Did he forget he was
supposed to meet you here?

334
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:59,950
哦 那个 我说的"见个人" 意义很宽泛
Oh, see, when I said "meeting someone,"
I guess it was kind of a broad term.

335
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,050
"见个人"有很多种解释
A wide interpretation
of the word "meeting. "

336
00:18:02,222 --> 00:18:04,198
好的 你知道吗? 我打电话给他
Right. You know what? I'll call him.

337
00:18:04,361 --> 00:18:07,400
哦 不 我是说 完全没必要
Oh, no. I mean, just totally unnecessary.

338
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:10,728
好吧
Okay.

339
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:12,617
我只是刚好在附近
I just was actually in the area...

340
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,906
顺便过来看看他在不在
...and so I just figured I'd swing by
and see if he was around.

341
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:20,201
因为我要还他这支笔
Because I had to return his pen.

342
00:18:20,614 --> 00:18:22,368
还他这支笔 他落下的
Had to return this pen. He left this.

343
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:27,297
我想我要早点还给他 免得他抓狂
And I just thought I should really return it
before he, you know, freaks out.

344
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,790
哦 好的 我帮你给他
Yeah. Okay, I'll get it to him.

345
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:31,708
谢谢
Thanks.

346
00:18:33,606 --> 00:18:37,317
"Wilson Ward 牙科学博士 儿童 成人 中老年牙医"
"Wilson Ward, DDS,
Adult, Child and Geriatric Dentistry. "

347
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:41,575
那个 我也不好说什么东西对人家重不重要
Look, I'm not going to judge what may
or may not be important to someone.

348
00:18:41,738 --> 00:18:44,154
没错 尽管这根本不是他的牙医
Yeah. That's not even
his dentist, though.

349
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:45,985
哦 是嘛 那谁是?
Oh, really. Who is?

350
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,344
我爸
My dad.

351
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:55,287
哦
Oh.

352
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:01,567
我叫Gigi 我上周和Conor约过会
I'm Gigi. I went out
with Conor last week.

353
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,032
然后我...
And I just...

354
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:08,442
想看看是否会碰到他
I thought if I just ran into him...

355
00:19:10,235 --> 00:19:12,211
我不知道 我要走了
I don't know. I'm gonna go.

356
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:13,946
等等
Wait.

357
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:15,097
等等 就...
Wait, just-

358
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,274
再等几秒钟 我请你喝杯东西
Hang out for a second.
Let me buy you a drink.

359
00:19:17,954 --> 00:19:20,850
就一杯 好吗?
One drink. Okay?

360
00:19:21,665 --> 00:19:24,791
稍等一会 我马上回来
Give me two seconds, I'll be right back.

361
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:30,295
你看起来满理智的 我就实话跟你说吧
Look, you seem like a cool girl,
so I'm just gonna be honest with you.

362
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,664
Conor不会打给你的
Conor's never gonna call you.

363
00:19:32,827 --> 00:19:35,320
哦 是吗 你怎么知道?
Oh, really. How do you know?

364
00:19:35,483 --> 00:19:37,909
因为我是男人 男人都这么做
Because I'm a guy,
and it's just how we do it.

365
00:19:38,072 --> 00:19:39,481
他说很高兴认识我
He said it was nice meeting me.

366
00:19:39,644 --> 00:19:42,061
我不管他有没有说你是他最爱的女人
I don't care if he said
you were his favorite female...

367
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:44,467
除了他妈妈和Joanie Cunningham(美剧'欢乐时光'女主角)
...since his mommy
and Joanie Cunningham.

368
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,670
但有一星期了吧 Gigi? 他都没打给你
Over a week went by, okay, Gigi?
And he didn't call you.

369
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,355
但也许他打了 我没收到口信
But maybe he did call
and I didn't get the message.

370
00:19:50,518 --> 00:19:51,860
也许他弄丢了我的号码
Or maybe he lost my number...

371
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:55,887
也许他出城了 也许他被车撞了 说不定他奶奶去世了
...or he's out of town,
or got hit by a cab, or his grandma died.

372
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,927
也说不定他没打是因为没兴趣再见你
Or he didn't call because
he has no interest in seeing you again.

373
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:04,306
好 但我朋友Terri就和一个没给她打电话的人约会过
Yeah. But my friend Terri once went
out with a guy who never called.

374
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:05,965
她完全忘记了他
She totally wrote him off.

375
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,758
- 一年多以后  - 好吧
- Over a year goes by.
- Right.

376
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:09,523
她碰巧遇到了他 最后他们...
She ran into him,
and it ended up that-

377
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:12,236
你的朋友Terri是个白痴 同时也是个例外
Your friend Terri's an idiot.
She's also the exception...

378
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,317
是概率极小的例外
...by the way.
The rare exception.

379
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,232
好吧 好吧 但说不定我也是个例外呢?
Okay. Okay.
But what if I'm the exception?

380
00:20:17,395 --> 00:20:20,051
不 你不是 你不是例外 实际上 你是普遍情况
No, you're not. You're not at all.
In fact, you're the rule.

381
00:20:20,214 --> 00:20:24,433
普遍情况就是 男人没打给你 是因为他不想打给你
And the rule is this: If a guy doesn't
call you, he doesn't wanna call you.

382
00:20:24,596 --> 00:20:26,159
- 真的?  - 是的
- Really?
- Yeah.

383
00:20:26,322 --> 00:20:28,048
- 一直是这样?  - 是的 一直是的
- Always?
- Yeah, always.

384
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:32,075
听我说 我知道该怎样甩掉一个女人 懂吗?
Look, I know what blowing off
a woman looks like, okay?

385
00:20:32,238 --> 00:20:34,607
我是老手 经验丰富
I do it early, I do it often.

386
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:39,046
所以相信我 如果一个男人表面上对你不怎么在乎
So trust me when I say if a guy is
treating you like he doesn't give a shit...

387
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:41,607
他就真的不在乎你
...he genuinely doesn't give a shit.

388
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:43,563
没有例外
No exceptions.

389
00:20:53,362 --> 00:20:54,983
谢谢
Thank you.

390
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,147
你说的我会好好想想
Given me a lot to think about.

391
00:21:04,303 --> 00:21:06,154
- 早晨好 早晨好  - 借过
Morning, morning.
Excuse me.

392
00:21:06,317 --> 00:21:07,429
- 你好  - 你好
- Hi.
- Hi.

393
00:21:07,592 --> 00:21:08,810
一切都还好吗?
Everything okay?

394
00:21:08,973 --> 00:21:10,047
哦 我昨晚一夜没睡
Oh, I was up all night.

395
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:12,156
求你告诉我你是在在忙肉桂的材料
Please say you were working
on the nutmeg copy.

396
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:15,330
当然了 基本搞定了 我有件重要的事要说
Sure. It's basically done.
I have to tell you something important.

397
00:21:15,503 --> 00:21:17,286
宝贝? 你的头发怎么了?
Sweetie? What's going on with your hair?

398
00:21:17,449 --> 00:21:20,642
是啊 到这边来 免得他们看到你的头上有块小松饼
Yeah, come here before people
see you have a mini muffin in your hair.

399
00:21:20,805 --> 00:21:22,407
好吧
Okay.

400
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,845
那个...
So...

401
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:28,965
谢谢 我想我是明白了
Thank you. I think I figured it out.

402
00:21:29,675 --> 00:21:32,130
还记得那个对我劈腿的公务员吗?
Remember that notary public
who cheated on me?

403
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:35,457
Anastasia告诉我她男朋友起初也对她劈腿
Then Anastasia told me her boyfriend
cheated on her at the beginning...

404
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,593
但后来他变了 现在他们结婚了 深陷爱河
...but then he changed and now
they're married and crazy in love?

405
00:21:39,206 --> 00:21:41,508
- 我以为他只是个技术师呢  - 不 公证员
- I thought that guy was a process server.
- No, notary.

406
00:21:41,671 --> 00:21:44,480
不管怎样 我想说 Anastasia是个例外 不是普遍情况
Anyway, my point is,
Anastasia's the exception, not the rule.

407
00:21:44,643 --> 00:21:46,532
我们不能再听信这些童话了
We have to stop listening
to these stories.

408
00:21:46,695 --> 00:21:49,629
实际真理是 出轨的男人根本不在乎你
The rule is that guys who cheat on you
don't care about you much.

409
00:21:50,473 --> 00:21:53,848
- 好吧  - 好的 案例A:
- Okay.
- Okay, so Exhibit A:

410
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,706
Chad 住在仓库里的鼓手
Chad, the drummer who lived
in a storage space.

411
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:00,541
他只是把我当司机 我却整个1998年都在跟踪他
He only used me for rides, and yet
I continued to stalk him for most of 1998.

412
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,130
还有... 哦 那个Don
And then... Oh, there was Don...

413
00:22:03,303 --> 00:22:06,716
他每逢周五就要和我分手 这样他就可以过自在的周末
...who broke up with me every Friday
so that he could have his weekends free.

414
00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:08,701
我曾经幻想过那段感情
I was delusional about that relationship.

415
00:22:08,864 --> 00:22:11,252
我告诉我的牙医说 他是我丈夫
I'd refer to him as my husband
to my dental hygienist.

416
00:22:11,424 --> 00:22:13,592
还有 不管如何 我的朋友们给我讲的那些
And all of my friends
used to tell me stories...

417
00:22:13,764 --> 00:22:16,276
关于这些白痴男人都会变好的故事
...about how things might work out
with these dipshits...

418
00:22:16,449 --> 00:22:19,134
因为她们朋友的朋友曾约会过这样的臭男人 和我类似
...because they knew someone
who dated a dipshit like mine...

419
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:21,186
结果这个朋友结婚了 过上幸福的生活
...and that girl ended up getting married.

420
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:24,273
但那都是例外 我们不是例外 我们只是普遍情况
But that's the exception.
We're not the exception, we're the rule.

421
00:22:29,595 --> 00:22:32,731
好了 我想想我是不是明白了
Okay, let me just see if I understand.

422
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:34,524
那么 你是说...
So what you're saying is...

423
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,851
如果我听说一个女孩已经和一个男人在一起13年了
...if I hear a story about a girl
who's been with a guy for 13 years...

424
00:22:38,014 --> 00:22:40,430
最后他们结婚了 这就是例外
...and he finally married her,
that's the exception.

425
00:22:40,603 --> 00:22:42,166
是的
Yes.

426
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:45,081
但是普遍情况是 像Neil这样的男人...
But the rule are guys like Neil...

427
00:22:45,848 --> 00:22:49,012
和我这样的女人
...who are with girls like me...

428
00:22:49,175 --> 00:22:51,601
在一起7年了还没结婚
...for seven years and aren't married...

429
00:22:51,774 --> 00:22:53,260
那就永远不会结婚了
...they're never getting married.

430
00:22:53,692 --> 00:22:55,034
- 不  - 不
- No.
- No.

431
00:22:55,197 --> 00:22:56,655
- 不 不 不 不 不 不  - 不
- No, no, no. No, no, no.
- No.

432
00:22:56,827 --> 00:23:00,538
- 她不是那个意思...  - 不 这和你没关系的
- It's not what she meant in that-
- No, it's got nothing to do with you.

433
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:02,734
我肯定不是在说你 我是说... 我是说...
I absolutely was not talking about you.

434
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:06,675
- 总是有特殊情况的  - 我是在讲我自己呢

- These are specific relationship situations.
- I was talking about myself specifically.

435
00:23:06,838 --> 00:23:09,331
专指我自己 知道么?
GIGl:
Just me specifically, you know?

436
00:23:13,588 --> 00:23:16,139
那个男人让你不得不喜欢 知道吗?
This guy is, like, impossible
not to like, you know?

437
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:19,437
他在便利超市和我很暧昧地打情骂俏
He's flirting with me pretty heavily
outside of the Handy Mart...

438
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:23,532
那个 一切都自然而然 真的很神奇
...and, you know, everything just kind
of lines up, it's really magical.

439
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:25,613
然后他告诉我他有老婆了
And then he tells me that he's married.

440
00:23:25,776 --> 00:23:28,115
我肯定是要发火的 对不对?
Which, of course,
I should be pissed about, right?

441
00:23:28,278 --> 00:23:31,174
但我就是忘不了他
But I just can't stop thinking about him.

442
00:23:31,347 --> 00:23:32,488
但他结婚了
But he's married.

443
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,949
我知道 我意识到了 我不知道我哪根筋搭错了
I know, I realize that.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

444
00:23:36,112 --> 00:23:37,321
我哪根筋搭错了?
What's wrong with me?

445
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:40,226
好吧
Okay.

446
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:43,055
我认识一个男人 他是我爸爸复印店里的员工
I know this guy,
he works in my dad's printing business.

447
00:23:43,218 --> 00:23:47,628
他跟一个好女人结婚15年了
And he was married for 15 years
to a nice lady.

448
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:52,298
某晚他在教堂的活动上遇到了一个女人
And one night he meets this woman
at some church event.

449
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:56,623
他告诉我爸爸说他从没有过那样的感觉
And he tells my dad that he's never
felt anything like it before.

450
00:23:57,265 --> 00:24:00,008
他觉得自己终于找到了灵魂伴侣
That he had finally met the one.

451
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:01,868
于是他和他妻子离婚...
So he divorced his wife...

452
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:05,157
... 之后他和这个女人一起过了22年...
...and he's been with this other woman
for 22 years...

453
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:07,525
... 非常幸福
...and they're insanely happy.

454
00:24:07,688 --> 00:24:10,181
我是说 如果你遇到了生命中的最爱...
I mean, what if you meet
the love of your life...

455
00:24:10,344 --> 00:24:12,358
... 但那个时候你已经嫁给了别人怎么办?
...but you already married someone else?

456
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:14,563
你就该无动于衷吗?
Are you supposed to
let them pass you by?

457
00:24:16,807 --> 00:24:20,106
你说得对 好
You're right. Okay.

458
00:24:20,777 --> 00:24:21,860
我给他打电话
I'm gonna call him.

459
00:24:22,637 --> 00:24:24,094
对
Okay.

460
00:24:38,823 --> 00:24:41,210
- 喂?  - 嘿 Ben 我是Anna Marks
<i>Hello?
- Hey, Ben. This is Anna Marks.</i>

461
00:24:41,383 --> 00:24:43,684
嘿 Anna 怎么了?
<i>Hey, Anna. What's up?</i>

462
00:24:43,847 --> 00:24:46,810
没什么 我只是... 想起来你说过能帮我
Nothing, I was just-
I was taking you up on your offer.

463
00:24:46,983 --> 00:24:51,240
你说你有些关系可能会对我有帮助
I know you said you had a couple
of contacts you thought could help me.

464
00:24:51,394 --> 00:24:56,447
我觉得我们可以边喝咖啡边聊一聊
And I thought maybe we could talk
about it over coffee or something like that.

465
00:24:59,496 --> 00:25:01,663
嗯 我...
<i>Look, I just...</i>

466
00:25:03,428 --> 00:25:05,316
不行 Anna
<i>I can't, Anna.</i>

467
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,826
你很优秀 只是... 怎么说呢
<i>You seemed great. I just- I don't know.</i>

468
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:10,878
我得挂了
<i>I should probably go.</i>

469
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:12,671
不过 多保重 再见
<i>Take care, though. Bye.</i>

470
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,301
- 嘿  - 嘿
- Hey.
- Hey.

471
00:25:21,474 --> 00:25:22,816
- 我就知道你会打给我  - 是吗
- I'm psyched you called.
- Cool.

472
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,309
我差点以为你不会回我电话了
Kind of given up on you
when you didn't call me back.

473
00:25:25,472 --> 00:25:27,064
我刚好想到你
I was just thinking about you.

474
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:28,953
- 来杯酒?  - 好
- Want a glass of wine?
- Sure.

475
00:25:29,116 --> 00:25:30,871
对了 都有哪些类型来着?
Okay, what were the categories again?

476
00:25:31,034 --> 00:25:32,798
四种类型:
Four categories:

477
00:25:32,961 --> 00:25:36,374
聪明 性感 风趣和可爱
Smart, sexy, funny and cute.

478
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:38,618
但只能选两项
But you can only be two things.

479
00:25:38,781 --> 00:25:42,933
比如Sarah Jessica Parker('欲望都市'女主演)属于风趣和性感
Like Sarah Jessica Parker
would be funny and sexy.

480
00:25:43,096 --> 00:25:44,985
比尔克林顿是聪明和性感
Bill Clinton would be smart and sexy.

481
00:25:45,148 --> 00:25:46,903
难以置信你居然认为克林顿是性感的
I can't believe you're hot for Clinton.

482
00:25:47,066 --> 00:25:48,533
选吧 我是哪种?
Go. What am I?

483
00:25:48,696 --> 00:25:49,808
等等 我是哪种来着?
Wait, what was I again?

484
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,736
你是聪明和可爱
You're smart and cute.

485
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:54,804
好吧 你是性感的 很性感
Okay, you are sexy, very sexy.

486
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:56,434
还有可爱的
And cute.

487
00:25:57,335 --> 00:25:58,994
不 不对...
No, you can't-

488
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:01,200
性感和可爱都是外表那一栏的
Sexy and cute
are both in the looks column.

489
00:26:01,372 --> 00:26:03,060
谁也不想只具有同一栏的特质
Nobody wants to be all in one column.

490
00:26:03,223 --> 00:26:07,020
尽管我这么说会显得很傻 但显然你四种类型都是
I sound like a jackass if I say you're
all four, which obviously you are.

491
00:26:07,193 --> 00:26:09,293
尤其是性感
Especially sexy.

492
00:26:09,465 --> 00:26:11,220
你是最好的
You're the best.

493
00:26:15,765 --> 00:26:17,673
我该走了
I better go.

494
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:21,863
好吧 呃 你想留的话可以留下
Okay, well, you know
you could stay here if you want.

495
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:24,213
怎么了? 你有一阵子没来了
What? It's been a while.

496
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:26,035
不 不行
No, I can't.

497
00:26:26,198 --> 00:26:28,528
我不能 我...
I can't stay, I'm totally-

498
00:26:28,691 --> 00:26:30,215
我彻底 彻底醉了
I'm totally, totally fried.

499
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,529
你没关系吧?
Is that okay?

500
00:26:31,702 --> 00:26:33,073
没事
Yeah.

501
00:26:37,426 --> 00:26:38,951
回头见
I'll see you later.

502
00:26:39,123 --> 00:26:40,494
再见
Bye.

503
00:26:50,448 --> 00:26:51,943
Hey.

504
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,986
你看看正吗?
That look straight to you?

505
00:26:54,158 --> 00:26:56,268
你挂那个干什么?
Why are you hanging that?

506
00:26:57,169 --> 00:27:00,132
因为三周前你要我把它挂起来
Because you asked me to
about three weeks ago.

507
00:27:00,305 --> 00:27:02,405
我现在总算是有空了
I'm getting around to it

508
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:04,514
怎么了? 你不喜欢吗?
Why? You don't want it here?

509
00:27:04,687 --> 00:27:06,307
不 我喜欢 但别弄了
No, I love it there. But just stop.

510
00:27:06,921 --> 00:27:08,839
为什么? 是画的原因吗?
Why? Is it the painting?

511
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:13,758
我也觉得这玩意看上去跟女人的平胸似的
You know, I know, it looks
kind of like a deflated boob here.

512
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,177
对吧? 我知道
Right? I know.

513
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,708
真是压抑 要不我拿下来?
It's gonna be depressing.
Should I take it down?

514
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:21,573
不是 我是不想你再对我好了
No, I want you
to stop doing anything nice.

515
00:27:23,912 --> 00:27:25,571
你在玩什么小把戏
This feels like a trick.

516
00:27:25,734 --> 00:27:27,144
- 不是  - 不是?
- No.
- No?

517
00:27:27,307 --> 00:27:31,133
不 我只... 我只是不想你再对我这么好...
No, I just- I just need you
to stop being nice to me...

518
00:27:31,305 --> 00:27:33,213
... 除非最终你会娶我
...unless you're gonna marry me after.

519
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,761
可笑吗?
Is that funny?

520
00:27:36,934 --> 00:27:38,343
你觉得可笑吗?
Do you think that's funny?

521
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,728
不 我不是觉得好笑
No, I guess it's not funny.

522
00:27:41,891 --> 00:27:43,751
呃 你不能总对我这么好...
See, you can't keep being nice to me...

523
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:47,453
... 我也不能再自欺欺人
...and I can't keep pretending
that this is something that it's not.

524
00:27:47,817 --> 00:27:50,780
我们在一起七年多了
We've been together
for over seven years.

525
00:27:50,953 --> 00:27:52,410
你了解我 你知道我是什么样的人
You know me, you know who I am.

526
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:55,296
你到底想不想娶我
You either wanna marry me
or you don't.

527
00:27:57,703 --> 00:27:59,966
不是我想不想娶你...
Or there's the possibility...

528
00:28:00,196 --> 00:28:03,332
... 我是真的不相信婚姻...
...that I mean it when I say
I don't believe in marriage-

529
00:28:03,495 --> 00:28:04,895
扯淡
Bullshit.

530
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,045
扯淡
Bullshit.

531
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:08,452
听着 对女人来说这就是扯淡...
Come on, it's bullshit for every woman...

532
00:28:08,615 --> 00:28:12,057
... 如果有个男人说他不相信婚姻...
...that has been told by some man
that he doesn't believe in marriage...

533
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:17,465
... 但六个月以后他娶了一个在健身房认识的24岁女人
...and then six months later he's married
to some 24-year-old that he met at a gym.

534
00:28:17,638 --> 00:28:19,460
就是... 就是扯淡
It's just- It's bullshit.

535
00:28:19,613 --> 00:28:21,023
你哪来的这些想法?
Where is this coming from?

536
00:28:21,186 --> 00:28:24,082
五年来我一直都在逃避这种念头
From the place I've been hiding
from you for about five years.

537
00:28:24,254 --> 00:28:25,242
五年来我一直都在逃避这种念头
Okay.

538
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:27,898
五年了 因为我不想让你觉得我要求太多
Five years, because I haven't wanted
to seem demanding.

539
00:28:28,061 --> 00:28:32,472
我也不想显得太依赖你或者精神错乱
And I haven't wanted
to seem clingy or psycho.

540
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:34,677
或者别的什么
Or whatever.

541
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,883
所以我才没问过你
So I haven't asked you.

542
00:28:38,139 --> 00:28:39,836
但现在...
But I...

543
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,576
我不得不问
I have to.

544
00:28:44,985 --> 00:28:46,740
我是说...
I mean...

545
00:28:49,243 --> 00:28:51,995
... 你到底会不会娶我?
...are you ever gonna marry me?

546
00:29:09,465 --> 00:29:11,795
哦 我不能再这样了
Oh, I can't do this anymore.

547
00:29:28,882 --> 00:29:30,954
我以前还觉得我从没被甩过
<i>I used to think that I had
never been dumped.</i>

548
00:29:31,126 --> 00:29:33,034
对 然后我们相互研究了一下
Yeah, then we started comparing notes.

549
00:29:33,207 --> 00:29:37,062
然后才发现其实每次都是我们被甩
Then we realized we've both been dumped
by every man we've ever been with.

550
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:38,797
- 每次  - 对
- Every one.
- Yeah.

551
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,386
- 不过他们是如此狡猾  - 嗯哼
- But they do it so skillfully.
- Mm-hm.

552
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:44,752
狡猾到你会以为分手是自己的主意
They just so sneaky
that you think it was your idea.

553
00:29:44,915 --> 00:29:47,053
对 你往那儿一坐心里就嘀咕了:
Yeah. You're sitting back
and you're like:

554
00:29:47,216 --> 00:29:50,927
"哦 对 是我的主意 慢着 我怎么被甩了?"
"Oh, yeah. This my idea.
But wait a second, why am I alone?"

555
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,478
"为什么我不快乐? 为什么我长了20磅?"
"Why am I unhappy?
Why have I gained 20 pounds?"

556
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,952
- 他们控制了你的思想  - 对 他们是
- They Jedi mind-trick you.
- Yes, they do.

557
00:29:56,115 --> 00:29:57,486
- 他们就这样过关了  - 对
- So they do a soft pass.
- Yeah.

558
00:29:57,649 --> 00:29:59,624
他们总是说那几句话
They got little lines they like to tell you.

559
00:29:59,787 --> 00:30:01,580
比如 "我不想妨碍你"
Like, "I don't wanna stand in your way. "

560
00:30:01,743 --> 00:30:05,003
或者 "你太好了 只是我还有待提高"
Or, "You're perfect,
it's just I have to work on myself. "

561
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:07,142
对 "我在为你的幸福着想"
Right. "I'm just thinking
of your happiness. "

562
00:30:07,314 --> 00:30:09,798
"哦 我配不上你" 我最喜欢这句
"Oh, I don't deserve you. "
That's my favorite one.

563
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,303
你知道我还喜欢哪句吗?
You know the other one I like?

564
00:30:11,466 --> 00:30:13,835
"我真嫉妒能娶你的那个人"
"I am so jealous of the guy
who gets to marry you. "

565
00:30:13,998 --> 00:30:15,724
- 可笑 你自己怎么不娶我呢  - 对
- Well, that could have been you.
- Yeah.

566
00:30:15,887 --> 00:30:17,507
我还觉得嫁给你更好呢
That's what I was leaning towards.

567
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,559
对 一旦你听到这些话...
Yeah. And the second you hear that...

568
00:30:19,722 --> 00:30:22,589
... 你就直接跑去商店 大吃排骨和冰淇淋...
...run to the store, get yourself some ribs
and some ice cream...

569
00:30:22,762 --> 00:30:24,421
... 因为你被甩了
...because you have been dumped.

570
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:26,914
嘿 Anna 我是Ben
Hey Anna, it's Ben.

571
00:30:27,086 --> 00:30:29,867
呃 我知道离你上次打电话来有一阵子了
Listen, I know it's been a while
since you called.

572
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,993
只是... 我没有料到
It's just- It took me by surprise.

573
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,467
不过我确实说要帮助你的事业...
But I did offer to help you
with your career...

574
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,634
... 没有什么不可以的 对吧?
...and I don't see why
I can't do that, right?

575
00:30:37,797 --> 00:30:39,331
不如你给我打个电话...
So why don't you give me a call...

576
00:30:39,494 --> 00:30:41,920
... 或许你可以来我办公室什么的
...and maybe you can
come by the office or something.

577
00:30:42,093 --> 00:30:44,480
好吧? 就这样 保重 再见
Okay? All right, take care. Bye.

578
00:30:44,653 --> 00:30:45,727
嘿 你
Hey, you.

579
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:47,836
哦 真是的
Oh, shit.

580
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:50,818
- 怎么了?  - 你吓到我了
- What?
- You scared me.

581
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:52,736
- 你没事吧?  - 没事
- You okay?
- Yeah.

582
00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:54,654
一切还好
Everything's fine.

583
00:30:54,951 --> 00:30:56,159
你又抽烟了?
Are you smoking again?

584
00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:58,298
没有 亲爱的 我没抽烟
No, sweetie, I'm not smoking.

585
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,448
怎么了?
Why?

586
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:01,050
你一抽烟就神经质
You get jumpy when you smoke.

587
00:31:01,222 --> 00:31:02,747
我没抽烟 我保证
I'm not smoking, I promise.

588
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:04,895
不是 我只是坐着...
No, I was just sitting here...

589
00:31:05,058 --> 00:31:08,577
... 想象这间屋子装修完了的样子
...trying to picture what this room's
gonna look like when it's finished.

590
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,948
- 挺有意思  - 是吗?
- I like that game.
- You do?

591
00:31:10,111 --> 00:31:11,453
是
Yeah.

592
00:31:12,518 --> 00:31:14,934
你想象的是什么颜色?
What color did you picture?

593
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:16,996
我正在为此踌躇
That's where I got stuck.

594
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:18,491
对
Yeah.

595
00:31:19,585 --> 00:31:21,474
我想...
I was thinking...

596
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,638
... 也许用黄色
...maybe yellow.

597
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,061
- 黄色? 好  - 对 我觉得 黄色是中间色
- Yellow? Okay.
- Yeah. I mean, it's neutral.

598
00:31:28,224 --> 00:31:31,897
- 呃  - 对 可以当作任何房间
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah. So it could be whatever.

599
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,416
可以当作办公室 可以当做客房...
It could be an office,
it could be a guest room...

600
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:38,168
... 健身房 婴儿房...
...a gym, a baby's room...

601
00:31:41,888 --> 00:31:44,640
等等 你是说"中间" 还是"中性"?
Wait, did you mean "neutral,"
or "gender-neutral"?

602
00:31:44,793 --> 00:31:48,217
- 不知道你在说什么  - 哦 真的?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, really?

603
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:52,666
我知道我说过 我们可以以后再谈这个
I know we said
we'd wait to talk about it.

604
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:54,488
- 呃  - 嗯
Uh-huh.
- Mm-hm.

605
00:31:55,322 --> 00:32:00,826
但我认为我们就快准备好了
But I think that we're almost ready
to start talking about it.

606
00:32:16,532 --> 00:32:18,987
所以那是我最后一次无偿服务
So that's the last time
I do anything pro bono.

607
00:32:22,132 --> 00:32:25,009
好了 女士们 我该回办公室去了
Well, ladies, I guess
I have to get back to the office.

608
00:32:25,622 --> 00:32:28,691
你快乐够要回去工作了? 工作有什么劲?
You go back to the office after happy hour?
What's happy about that?

609
00:32:28,854 --> 00:32:30,350
遇见你使一切都有意思了
I met you.

610
00:32:32,565 --> 00:32:34,952
有时间我想给你打电话 你有名片吗?
I would love to call you sometime.
Do you have a card?

611
00:32:36,726 --> 00:32:37,838
- 当然  - 哦 太好了
- Of course.
- Oh, great.

612
00:32:38,001 --> 00:32:41,041
这是我的信息
Here is my info.

613
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,014
- 很高想见到你 Janine  - 很高兴见到你
- Nice to meet you, Janine.
- Nice to meet you.

614
00:32:44,694 --> 00:32:46,315
期待着你打来电话 Gigi
Look forward to hearing from you, Gigi.

615
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:49,863
哦 等等
Oh, wait.

616
00:32:51,253 --> 00:32:52,490
那个...
So...

617
00:32:52,883 --> 00:32:54,254
... 我们怎么联系?
...how are we doing this?

618
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:57,284
是你等我的电话还是我等你的?
Are you hearing from me
or am I getting a call?

619
00:32:57,457 --> 00:32:58,435
什么?
What?

620
00:32:58,924 --> 00:33:00,525
你说你会给我打电话...
You said you'd love to call me...

621
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:03,469
... 但你又说 "期待着你打电话来" 这...
...but then you said,
"Look forward to hearing from you," and-

622
00:33:03,632 --> 00:33:05,454
是不是有点不好理解?
You see how that's kind of confusing?

623
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:08,369
对 呃 我们再商量吧 我们会再联系的
Yeah, look, we'll talk. We'll get in touch.

624
00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:11,715
你又来了 含糊其辞
You did it again. Very vague.

625
00:33:11,888 --> 00:33:14,439
知道吗? 我们直接说你给我打电话...
You know what?
Let's just say that you'll call me...

626
00:33:14,602 --> 00:33:17,095
... 然后就可以省略其他的废话了
...and then we can skip all the nonsense.

627
00:33:17,258 --> 00:33:19,051
再见 Gigi
Goodbye, Gigi.

628
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:32,226
- 他挺可爱  - 对 可别上网去搜索人家的资料
- He was cute.
- Yeah, please don't cyber-stalk him.

629
00:33:34,604 --> 00:33:36,100
你干什么?
What are you doing?

630
00:33:36,263 --> 00:33:37,375
我不会给他打电话
I'm not calling him.

631
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,753
他要是想见我 他会打电话的
If he wants to see me, he'll call.

632
00:33:39,974 --> 00:33:41,153
喔
Wow.

633
00:33:41,326 --> 00:33:44,221

That guy Alex really
made an impression on you.

634
00:33:44,394 --> 00:33:45,535
他好看吗?
Was he hot?

635
00:33:45,708 --> 00:33:48,124
不 他就是...
No. He was just...

636
00:33:48,325 --> 00:33:49,438

怎么样?
So?

644
00:34:19,009 --> 00:34:20,026
哦 嗨
Oh, hi.

645
00:34:25,415 --> 00:34:27,515
- 他约我了  - 哦 天呐 他打电话了?
- He asked me out.
Oh, my God. He called?

646
00:34:28,962 --> 00:34:31,062
- 呃...  - 他发电子邮件了?
Well...
- He e-mailed?

647
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,664
- 没有  - 什么?
- No.
What?

648
00:34:32,836 --> 00:34:34,773
只是给你的同伴留了个电话号码?
Left his calling card
with your lady-in-waiting?

649
00:34:36,384 --> 00:34:39,548
- 他在MySpace上联系的我  - 哎呦

00:34:39,836 --> 00:34:43,902

- Oh.
- Oh, girl, I don't know about that.

651
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:47,545
我的小姐妹说用MySpace联系只是想上床
My trampy little sister says
MySpace is the new booty call.

652
00:34:48,447 --> 00:34:50,815
我能怎么办呢?
Well, what am I supposed to do?

653
00:34:50,978 --> 00:34:52,532
我是说 时代不同了
I mean, things have changed.

654
00:34:52,704 --> 00:34:54,938
人们不再那么愿意见面了
People don't meet each other
organically anymore.

655
00:34:55,101 --> 00:34:58,899
如果我想让自己在异性面前更有吸引力...
If I would like to make myself seem
more attractive to the opposite sex...

656
00:34:59,071 --> 00:35:02,005
... 我不用去换个新的发型 更新我的资料就行了
...I don't go and get a new haircut,
I update my profile.

657
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:03,990
就是这么回事 明白?
That's just the way it is, you know?

658
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:06,454
是 她说得对
Yeah, she's right.

659
00:35:06,617 --> 00:35:08,794
回去 回去 回去 回去
Back, back, back, back.

660
00:35:10,012 --> 00:35:11,738
广告销售 我是Mary
Ad sales, this is Mary.

661
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:15,890
嗨 Mary 我是Conor Anna的朋友 随便了
Hi, Mary, this is Conor,
Anna's friend, or whatever.

662
00:35:16,053 --> 00:35:17,040
嗨
<i>Hi.</i>

663
00:35:17,434 --> 00:35:19,821
那么 你觉得怎么样?
So, what'd you think?

664
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:22,228
我正在看 我不太确定
Looking at it right now.
I'm not sure about this.

665
00:35:22,391 --> 00:35:23,599
哦 你要相信我
Oh, you have to trust me.

666
00:35:23,772 --> 00:35:26,226
这个市场正在迅速发展 你会赚大钱的
It's a burgeoning market,
you're gonna make a fortune.

667
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:29,391
我知道 你一定要把我放在按摩广告那页里吗?
I know. Did you have to put me
with the massage ads?

668
00:35:29,563 --> 00:35:32,977
呃 不是这页的话就是私人信息那页了 所以...
Well, it was either that or the page
with the personals, so...

669
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,933
这一页很多人看哦
<i>This page gets a lot of action.</i>

670
00:35:35,096 --> 00:35:36,851
对 你说的对
Yeah, I guess you're right.

671
00:35:37,014 --> 00:35:38,606
嘿 你最近有没有见过Anna?
Hey, have you spoken to Anna lately?

672
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,332
见过
Yeah.

673
00:35:42,163 --> 00:35:43,726
好的
Okay.

674
00:35:44,886 --> 00:35:47,053
先这样 Mary 我以后联系你 谢谢
All right, Mary,
I'll talk to you soon. Thank you.

675
00:35:47,216 --> 00:35:48,597
再见
<i>Bye.</i>

676
00:35:49,297 --> 00:35:52,298
我想告诉你 这是有区别的
What I'm trying to show you is
that there's a difference.

677
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,187
确实有区别
There is a difference.

678
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:58,032
嘿 你是怎么说服Linda阿姨在两周内把这些礼服缝制好的?
Hey, how did you get Aunt Linda
to sew these dresses in two weeks?

679
00:35:58,195 --> 00:35:59,375
她喜欢做这些
She wanted to do it.

680
00:35:59,538 --> 00:36:02,769
真的吗? 她告诉我 她感觉这样就像裁缝铺里的印尼老太婆
Really? She told me she felt like
an old Indonesian lady in a sweat shop.

681
00:36:02,932 --> 00:36:04,620
- 不是这样吗?  - 不 她没有这么想
- Is that not right?
No, she didn't.

682
00:36:04,783 --> 00:36:05,828
不是?
No?

683
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:10,057
什么... ? 为什么急着结婚?
What's the-?
Why the big rush to get married?

684
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:14,381
因为我不想在冬天穿的那么臃肿去结婚...
Because I am not having my wedding
during a gross Baltimore winter...

685
00:36:14,544 --> 00:36:16,328
...而且我还不想等到来年春天
...and I am not waiting till spring.

686
00:36:16,491 --> 00:36:18,408
你真像怀孕了
You are so pregnant.

687
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:20,039
哦 天哪 我没怀孕
Oh, God, I'm not pregnant.

688
00:36:20,202 --> 00:36:22,091
我没有怀孕 真是无聊
I'm not pregnant. That's ridiculous.

689
00:36:22,254 --> 00:36:24,363
- 那来瓶啤酒吧  - 不 我不喝啤酒
- Chug a beer then.
No, I'm not chugging a beer.

690
00:36:24,526 --> 00:36:25,504
来一瓶吧
Chug a beer.

691
00:36:25,677 --> 00:36:27,336
我们是相爱的 你们这群傻瓜
We're in love, you assholes.

692
00:36:27,499 --> 00:36:30,912
结婚 是相爱的人都会做的事情
That's what people do
when they're in love, they get married.

693
00:36:33,645 --> 00:36:37,087
但是你知道吗? 并不是所有的人都会结婚 你懂吗?
But you know what?
Not everybody gets married, you know?

694
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,606
有很多人永远都不会结婚
There are many people
who never get married.

695
00:36:41,095 --> 00:36:43,301
谢谢你这么积极的鼓励我
Well, thanks
for the inspirational pep talk.

696
00:36:43,464 --> 00:36:47,357
她其实想说 你和Neil分手没什么
What she meant to say was that it's fine
that you broke up with Neil.

697
00:36:47,529 --> 00:36:48,508
对
Right.

698
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,327
很多人选择独身 而且他们过得很开心
Tons of people make the choice
to be alone. They're happy.

699
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,829
比如阿尔・帕西诺（教父主角)
Look at Al Pacino.

700
00:36:53,992 --> 00:36:57,118
从没结过婚 开心的不得了
Never been married, happy as a clam.

701
00:36:57,291 --> 00:37:00,772
我是不是... ? 在这件事上要向阿尔・帕西诺学习?
Would that-? Am I-?
Would I be Al Pacino in this scenario?

702
00:37:00,935 --> 00:37:02,939
不是 Bethie 我们只是... 我们希望你能快乐
No, Bethie, we just-
We want you to be happy.

703
00:37:03,332 --> 00:37:06,266
那你就换掉这身珊瑚红的衣服
Well, then you should have
rethought the coral.

704
00:37:06,439 --> 00:37:08,260
哦 她那副表情
Oh, her face.

705
00:37:08,423 --> 00:37:09,795
- 瞧你那表情  - 别把她弄哭了
- Your face.
- Don't make her cry.

706
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:11,866
我最讨厌这玩笑了
I'm sick of these coral jokes.

707
00:37:12,038 --> 00:37:14,848
我知道 你很多愁善感 相信我 我了解
I know, you're sensitive.
Trust me, I get it.

708
00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:18,463
嘿 你干嘛不来跟我和Steven 还有孩子们吃晚饭呢...
Hey, why don't you have dinner
with me and Steven and the kids...

709
00:37:18,626 --> 00:37:20,093
... 然后在我那儿过夜...?
...then you can just stay over-?

710
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,528
她干嘛要和你还有你老公呆在一起啊?
Why'd she wanna hang out
with you and your husband?

711
00:37:22,691 --> 00:37:24,216
我最不愿意这么做
The last thing I'd feel like doing.

712
00:37:24,389 --> 00:37:26,211
如果参加婚礼让你这么痛苦...
If being in this wedding is too painful-

713
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:29,854
哦 天啊 姐妹们 求你们了 别说了 放松 放松
Oh, God, you guys. Please, stop it.
Relax, relax.

714
00:37:30,305 --> 00:37:32,510
打住吧 好吗? 说真的 姐妹们 我是...
That's enough, okay?
Seriously, you guys, I'm f-

715
00:37:32,673 --> 00:37:36,662
我之前也分过手 如果你们还记得 我那时候处理的很好
I've gone through breakups before.
If you remember, I handle them quite well.

716
00:37:36,835 --> 00:37:40,987
你们亲眼见证过的 我有能力做好这些事情
You've been there, you've seen it.
I'm perfectly capable of doing this.

717
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,674
这一次也不例外
I can do it again.

718
00:37:42,847 --> 00:37:44,957
我不希望你们为我担心
I want you to stop worrying about me.

719
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,903
我很好
I'm fine.

720
00:37:47,747 --> 00:37:49,780
我知道它肯定在这
I know it's here somewhere.

721
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:54,804
我和George Lane谈过关于音乐的事情 他有一堆的名单
I spoke with George Lane in Music.
He had a whole list of references for you.

722
00:37:56,127 --> 00:37:59,896
那好吧 等你找到了再给我打电话
Well, that's okay.
You can just call me when you find it.

723
00:38:02,331 --> 00:38:05,467
我发誓 我不是要找借口引你到这儿来
I swear I didn't lure you here
under false pretenses.

724
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,289
我知道
I know.

725
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,756
但是 女孩子总可以幻想一下吧
A girl can dream, though.

726
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,617
你就是太好了
You're just too good a guy.

727
00:38:21,077 --> 00:38:22,228
再问一次 你为什么结婚?
Why are you married again?

728
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:26,159
真的 为什么?
Seriously, why?

729
00:38:26,332 --> 00:38:28,911
不 我真的觉得 知道了是件好事...
No, I really think
that it would be good for me to know...

730
00:38:29,084 --> 00:38:31,826
...为什么你没有这个女人就不能活
...why you cannot live
without this other woman.

731
00:38:33,207 --> 00:38:38,126
我们从大学的时候就在一起了 而且她给我下了最后通牒
Well, we'd been together since college
and she gave me an ultimatum.

732
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:41,741
她说 "如果我们不结婚 那就分手"
She said, "Either we get married
or we break up. "

733
00:38:41,914 --> 00:38:43,218
所以我们就结婚了
So we got married.

734
00:38:44,023 --> 00:38:46,229
哇 你屈服了
Wow. You caved.

735
00:38:48,377 --> 00:38:49,450
这很复杂
It's complicated.

736
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,282
真的吗?
Really?

737
00:38:52,759 --> 00:38:56,613
知道吗? 如果你和一个女孩恋爱很久却没有和她结婚 那你是个混蛋
What? You're a dick if you date a girl
for too long and don't marry her.

738
00:38:57,169 --> 00:39:00,142
而在没准备好的时候娶了她 那你就是个笨蛋
You marry her and you're an asshole
for marrying before you're ready.

739
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:03,603
见鬼 我也不知道
I mean, shit, I don't know.

740
00:39:16,366 --> 00:39:18,025
你真的很漂亮
You're really hot.

741
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:21,582
我显然迷上你了
And I am obviously attracted to you.

742
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:25,993
所以我想我最好是...
So I think the best I can do is...

743
00:39:26,923 --> 00:39:30,538
... 等找到了那张单子 再打给你...
...eventually find this piece of paper
and call you...

744
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:34,661
... 希望能为你的事业 尽一点绵薄之力
...and hope to just help you out in
your career in some small way.

745
00:39:45,228 --> 00:39:46,206
嗨
Hi.

746
00:39:46,379 --> 00:39:48,421
嗨 还好吗?
Hi. What's going on?

747
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,566
Javier.

748
00:40:00,263 --> 00:40:03,677
Javier 不是说好了要把家具罩上布吗
Javier, I thought we talked
about tarping the furniture.

749
00:40:44,189 --> 00:40:45,177
City Supper(餐厅名字)
City Supper.

750
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,133

- 你好?  - 嗨 我是Gigi
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, this is Gigi.</i>

755
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:56,607
<i>- Gigi?

756
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:59,282
- 嗯?  - 我 呃...
- Huh?
- I, um...

757
00:40:59,455 --> 00:41:00,883
...有一支牙医的钢笔
...had the dentist pen.

758
00:41:01,056 --> 00:41:03,127
是 嘿 你怎么样?
<i>Right. Hey. How you doing?</i>

759
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,975
- 我很抱歉麻烦你  - 没什么
<i>- I'm really sorry to bug you.
- That's okay.</i>

760
00:41:06,138 --> 00:41:09,207
你的见解独到 我想问你个问题
You had some really good insights
and I wanted to ask you a question.

761
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,757
好的 听着 现在我必须说点难听的了
Okay, look, now I need
to be harsh with you.

762
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,356
Conor永远不会对你有兴趣的 Geege
Conor's never gonna be
interested in you, Geege.

763
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:17,424
嗯 我知道 这次是关于Jarrad的
No, I know. This is about Jarrad.

764
00:41:17,597 --> 00:41:18,642
<i>Jarrad.</i>

765
00:41:18,814 --> 00:41:21,595
我们在酒吧特价时间遇到的 他长得很帅...
So we meet at happy hour
and he's completely charming-

766
00:41:21,758 --> 00:41:25,527
嘿 等我一下 好吗? 就一会 等一下
Hey, give me two seconds, okay?
Two seconds, hold on.

767
00:41:35,384 --> 00:41:36,362
让我猜猜 他说:
Let me guess. He said:

768
00:41:36,534 --> 00:41:38,865
"最开心的就是遇到你"
"The only thing happy
about this hour is you. "

769
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:42,729
他或许比这更老套
He might have used
some derivative of that.

770
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:49,287
他说他会打电话 但是之后他给了我名片 还说...
So he says he's going to call, but then
he gives me his card and he says-

771
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,889
哦 他对你没兴趣
<i>Oh, he's not interested.</i>

772
00:41:51,061 --> 00:41:53,746
- 我还没说他打没打  - 他打了吗?
- You don't even know if he's called.
- Oh, did he?

773
00:41:54,322 --> 00:41:55,309
没有
No.

774
00:41:55,827 --> 00:41:58,694
- 但是我真的认为他期待...  - 算了吧
<i>- But I honestly think he's expect-
- Okay.</i>

775
00:41:58,867 --> 00:42:02,990
Gigi 他对你没有兴趣
Gigi, he is not interested.

776
00:42:04,342 --> 00:42:05,483
Alex 这没什么大不了的
Alex, this is jacked.

777
00:42:05,646 --> 00:42:08,302
女领班因为我没穿黑色衬衫 把我给骂了一顿
The hostess is giving me shit
for not wearing a black shirt.

778
00:42:08,465 --> 00:42:09,807
- 这不是黑色的  - 看看
- It's not black.
- Look at it.

779
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:12,818
不是黑色的衬衫 我看见了 不是黑的
Not a black shirt. I see it. It's not black.

780
00:42:12,981 --> 00:42:14,573
这件衬衫是黑色的
This shit is black.

781
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:21,391
如果一个男人给你他的名片 却没要你的 说明他不喜欢你
If a guy gives you his phone number instead
of taking yours, he's not interested.

782
00:42:21,554 --> 00:42:23,078
他先要了我的 然后他给...
He took mine first. Then he gave-

783
00:42:23,251 --> 00:42:26,559
还有 如果一个男人想要约你 相信我 他一定会约你的
<i>And also, if a guy wants to see you,
believe me, he will see you.</i>

784
00:42:28,592 --> 00:42:32,303
我曾经给55个叫Lauren Bells的打了电话 直到找到我想找的那个
I once called 55 Lauren Bells
until I got the right one.

785
00:42:32,945 --> 00:42:34,086
那真是太可爱了
That's cute.

786
00:42:34,249 --> 00:42:35,266
之后怎么样了?
What happened?

787
00:42:35,438 --> 00:42:38,756
哦 她的屁股在白天看起来真大
Oh, yeah, as it turns out,
her ass looked really huge in the daylight.

788
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,339
是不是因为你的细腻 你才这么受女人欢迎?
Is it your sensitivity that makes you
so popular with women?

789
00:42:43,656 --> 00:42:45,899
不要给他打电话 他不喜欢你
Don't call him. He doesn't like you.

790
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,971
不要总是否定我的感觉
Don't tiptoe around my feelings.

791
00:42:48,143 --> 00:42:50,655
- 我只是想要帮你  - 我知道 谢谢你
<i>- Well, I'm just trying to help.
- I know. Thank you.</i>

792
00:42:50,828 --> 00:42:52,199
不客气
Sure.

793
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:55,009
我要回去工作了 祝你好运
I gotta get back to work, but good luck.

794
00:42:55,181 --> 00:42:56,898
好的 再见
Okay, bye.

795
00:43:01,126 --> 00:43:02,306
嘿 哥们 在家吗?
Hey, buddy, you home?

796
00:43:02,469 --> 00:43:04,607
在 进来吧
Yeah. Come on in.

797
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:09,507
嘿 想喝啤酒吗?
Hey, you want a beer?

798
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,151
还是苹果马爹利?
Or an apple martini?

799
00:43:13,323 --> 00:43:14,599
哦 真好笑
Oh, that's funny.

800
00:43:16,449 --> 00:43:18,146
你告诉你父母了吗?
Have you told your parents?

801
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:20,735
这是为了工作 我想扩大客户群
It's for work.
I'm trying to expand my client base.

802
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,624
以假装成一个同性恋的方式?
By pretending to be gay?

803
00:43:22,787 --> 00:43:25,376
应该说是 以对同性恋友好的方式
No, by being more gay-friendly.

804
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:27,515
或者 更准确点是 "同性相怜"
Or, in real estate terms, "gay-adjacent. "

805
00:43:27,687 --> 00:43:29,212
不错 我以后就这么说
Nice. I'm gonna use that.

806
00:43:29,384 --> 00:43:31,715
我应该换了它 这或许是有点过头了
I should change this.
It's maybe a little much.

807
00:43:31,878 --> 00:43:35,291
我不知道 穿成那样 和一个不会跟你上床的女孩约会...
I don't know. Dressing like that,
seeing a girl who won't sleep with you...

808
00:43:35,454 --> 00:43:36,864
... 我觉得你应该放弃
...I think you can pull it off.

809
00:43:37,027 --> 00:43:39,127
不是她不会跟我上床 傻逼
It's not that she won't sleep with me,
douche bag.

810
00:43:39,299 --> 00:43:41,668
她跟我上过床 只是她 你知道的....
I have slept with her.
It's just she, you know...

811
00:43:42,655 --> 00:43:44,563
再也不会和你上床
Won't sleep with you anymore.

812
00:43:45,052 --> 00:43:46,874
差不多 是的
Pretty much, yeah.

813
00:43:47,421 --> 00:43:48,917
你怎么看?
What do you think?

814
00:43:49,089 --> 00:43:50,393
我觉得你有问题...
I think you got a problem...

815
00:43:50,556 --> 00:43:54,449
... 因为你的美丽和性感 把她们都吓跑了
...because you're gonna have to beat them
away with a stick, you gorgeous, sexy man.

816
00:43:54,622 --> 00:43:55,830
见鬼
Holy shit.

817
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,419
注意你的呼吸
Observe your breath.

818
00:43:59,138 --> 00:44:01,852
吸气 鼓腹
Inhale, belly rise.

819
00:44:03,482 --> 00:44:06,934
呼气 收腹
And exhale, belly fall.

820
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:10,769
双手合十 放于胸前
Bring your hands together
in front of your chest.

821
00:44:11,517 --> 00:44:13,972
心怀感激的低下头
Bow your head in gratitude.

822
00:44:18,076 --> 00:44:20,761
- 合十礼  - 合十礼
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

823
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:22,928
谢谢你们来上课 下周再见
Thank you for coming.
See you next week.

824
00:44:26,716 --> 00:44:28,144
很好的课程
Great class.

825
00:44:39,641 --> 00:44:41,492
我们偶遇了
We ran into each other.

826
00:44:42,489 --> 00:44:43,726
你来上我的课
You came to my class.

827
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,123
我不知道是你上课
I had no idea this was your class.

828
00:44:47,609 --> 00:44:49,968
你打电话问过是不是我上课的
You called to ask me
if this was my class.

829
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:51,445
没有 你根本没有回我电话
No, you never called back.

830
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:54,417
因为你说 如果是我的课就不要回电话
Because you told me not to call you
if it was my class. It was.

831
00:44:54,581 --> 00:44:56,786
- 不 我们只是偶遇  - 好吧
- No. We just ran into each other.
- Okay.

832
00:44:56,949 --> 00:45:01,389
我们只是单纯的朋友 碰巧在一起健身
We're just two innocent folks who happen
to be working out near each other.

833
00:45:01,552 --> 00:45:03,441
确实是
Exactly.

834
00:45:05,425 --> 00:45:06,634
你想游泳吗?
Do you want a swim?

835
00:45:07,765 --> 00:45:08,743
当然
Sure.

836
00:45:14,995 --> 00:45:16,846
你知道 我只是想...
You know, I was just thinking...

837
00:45:18,485 --> 00:45:19,761
...为什么我们不能成为朋友?
...why can't we be friends?

838
00:45:20,499 --> 00:45:23,395
我是说 我就不能再有朋友了吗?
I mean, am I not allowed
to have friends anymore?

839
00:45:23,826 --> 00:45:27,499
我是说 我不能跟那些性感的女孩做朋友吗?
I mean, am I not allowed to be friends
with people that are hot?

840
00:45:27,662 --> 00:45:30,251
我是说 这是哪门子的规定?
I mean, what kind of
reverse prejudice is that?

841
00:45:30,414 --> 00:45:31,564
我听着呢
I hear you.

842
00:45:31,727 --> 00:45:33,156
我是说...
I mean...

843
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:36,589
... 我就不能和已婚男人做朋友吗?
...am I not supposed to be friends
with a guy just because he's married?

844
00:45:36,752 --> 00:45:37,730
对
Right.

845
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,724
一个傻笑的?
Or has an insane smile?

846
00:45:39,887 --> 00:45:42,150
有着令人浮想联翩的屁股的男人?
Or an ass that makes me
wanna dry hump?

847
00:45:47,242 --> 00:45:50,445
- 你刚才说"浮想联翩"?  - 是啊
- Did you just say "dry hump"?
- Yeah.

848
00:45:53,935 --> 00:45:55,239
我想我恋爱了
Think I just fell in love.

849
00:46:01,577 --> 00:46:03,265
所以我们是朋友了
So we're friends.

850
00:46:04,109 --> 00:46:05,317
对
Yeah.

851
00:46:39,203 --> 00:46:40,507
你想下来吗?
You wanna come in?

852
00:46:44,228 --> 00:46:45,848
对不起 我不能信任我自己
I'm sorry, I don't trust myself.

853
00:46:46,462 --> 00:46:49,147
没关系 你可以看
That's okay. You can just watch.

854
00:46:51,621 --> 00:46:54,459
你或许是我有过的最好的朋友
You know, you may be
the best friend I've ever had.

855
00:47:05,371 --> 00:47:07,672
- 嗨  - 嘿
- Hi.
- Hey.

856
00:47:13,282 --> 00:47:16,024
- 冲个凉 嘿  - 什么? 嗨
Take a shower. Hey.
- What? Hi.

857
00:47:16,187 --> 00:47:18,095
- 亲爱的?  - 嗯
- Honey?
- Yeah.

858
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,624
你闻起来怪怪的
You smell weird.

859
00:47:21,787 --> 00:47:23,791
- 我闻起来怪怪的?  - 对 不一样
- I smell weird?
- Yeah, different.

860
00:47:23,964 --> 00:47:27,061
- 怎么不一样?  - 我不知道
- Different how?
- I don't know.

861
00:47:28,758 --> 00:47:30,187
似乎难以启齿
Sort of an odd thing to say.

862
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:33,524
可能是因为我在后院
You know, maybe it was the ashtray
and cigarettes I found.

863
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:35,547
找到的烟灰缸和香烟
In the back yard.

864
00:47:36,218 --> 00:47:39,536
"我父亲死于肺癌"这句话...
What part of
"My dad died of lung cancer"...

865
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:42,575
... 很难记吗?
...is so hard for you
to wrap your brain around?

866
00:47:42,748 --> 00:47:43,726
什么?
What?

867
00:47:43,899 --> 00:47:47,245
不要骗我 Ben 求你 好吗?
Do not lie to me, Ben. Please, okay?

868
00:47:51,416 --> 00:47:53,305
你是说真的吗?
Are you serious?

869
00:47:56,498 --> 00:48:01,647
每天在这儿工作的工人那么多
We have, like, 8000 undocumented
workers here daily.

870
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:06,288
你发现了一个烟灰缸还有些烟蒂 所以你就认为...
Okay, and you find an ashtray
with cigarettes in it and you think-

871
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:09,386
你就直接认为那些是我的
You automatically assume
that they're mine.

872
00:48:09,558 --> 00:48:11,054
哦 是的
Oh, yeah.

873
00:48:11,217 --> 00:48:13,231
亲爱的 我没有骗你
Honey, I'm not lying to you.

874
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:19,693
我觉得...
I think...

875
00:48:20,432 --> 00:48:22,570
...你真是神经过敏
...you are really freaking out.

876
00:48:22,925 --> 00:48:26,569
因为没什么进展 整个装修工作让你压力很大
This whole renovation thing's getting
to you because nothing's happening.

877
00:48:32,111 --> 00:48:33,904
那就说不
Just say no.

878
00:48:34,067 --> 00:48:35,237
然后扔掉它
Get it out.

879
00:48:35,409 --> 00:48:36,522
洗个澡
Gonna take a shower.

880
00:48:37,068 --> 00:48:39,302
- 我很累  - 好吧
- I'm exhausted.
- Okay.

881
00:48:42,668 --> 00:48:45,832
- 抱歉  - 没事
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

882
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:57,387
谁会想到一个瑜伽课上认识的女孩...
Who'd have thought that a random girl
from yoga...

883
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:01,289
- ... 会给我介绍一个接吻高手?  - 继续 美女
- ...would fix me up with such a good
kisser? - Back at you, sister.

884
00:49:04,713 --> 00:49:06,276
我都等不及再吻你了
I can't wait to kiss you again.

885
00:49:06,889 --> 00:49:08,414
但是我们正在接吻啊
But we're kissing right now.

886
00:49:08,587 --> 00:49:09,699
我知道 我是说下一次
I know, next time.

887
00:49:09,862 --> 00:49:12,451
二次约会的吻会更有性趣
The second-date kiss
is way more intimate.

888
00:49:14,311 --> 00:49:15,490
听着
Well, listen...

889
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:19,000
我明天要走了 所以暂时不能联络了
...I'm leaving tomorrow,
so I'll be out of touch for a little bit.

890
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:24,168
等我两秒钟好吗? 健怡可乐喝多了
Can you excuse me a quick second?
Too many Diet Cokes.

891
00:49:24,619 --> 00:49:25,731
好的
Okay.

892
00:49:43,298 --> 00:49:44,314
好
Oh, yeah.

893
00:49:44,487 --> 00:49:45,494
喂?
Yeah?

894
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:48,313
嘿 不好意思又打扰你了 问你一个问题 很快
Hey, sorry to bug you again.
Quick question.

895
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,681
等一下好吗 宝贝 抱歉
Excuse me one minute, babe. Sorry.

896
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:52,704
怎么了?
What's going on?

897
00:49:52,867 --> 00:49:55,763
我和一个男的在亲热 限制级的
Okay, I'm making out with this guy-
PG stuff.

898
00:49:55,936 --> 00:49:59,234
他说他要去趟外地 会暂时不能联络
And he mentions that he's going
out of town, he's gonna be out of touch.

899
00:49:59,388 --> 00:50:00,471
继续
Run.

900
00:50:01,219 --> 00:50:03,127
也许他真的要去外地
But maybe he is going out of town.

901
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,783
去哪儿? 他要去哪儿?
Where? Where's he going
that he's gonna be out of touch?

902
00:50:08,353 --> 00:50:10,137
你刚才说你要去哪儿?
Where are you going
out of town to again?

903
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,476
嗯... 呃... 匹兹堡
Um- Uh- Pittsburgh.

904
00:50:13,953 --> 00:50:15,065
匹兹堡
Pittsburgh.

905
00:50:15,228 --> 00:50:16,312
离开他
Run.

906
00:50:16,475 --> 00:50:19,773
现在 我应该离开所有不喜欢我的男孩?
So, what, now I'm just supposed to run
from every guy who doesn't like me?

907
00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:21,940
没错
Yeah.

908
00:50:22,784 --> 00:50:25,297
那就没人了
There's not gonna be anybody left.

909
00:50:26,332 --> 00:50:28,470
我不知道我为什么说这个
I don't know why I'm saying this...

910
00:50:28,633 --> 00:50:31,347
但是我认识一个不错的男生 我想他会喜欢你的
...but I think I know a nice guy
who might actually like you.

911
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:33,140
- 真的?  - 真的
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

912
00:50:33,303 --> 00:50:35,317
他是我哥的朋友 他叫Bill
<i>He's friends with my brother.
His name's Bill.</i>

913
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,906
我们都是喝酒的时候碰面 还不错
<i>We'll all meet for drinks and it'll be good.</i>

914
00:50:38,078 --> 00:50:41,933
那么 我... 我现在在他家浴室里
So, I mean, I'm in his bathroom
right now.

915
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:43,084
我该怎么办?
<i>What do I do?</i>

916
00:50:43,256 --> 00:50:47,216
你总会出来的吧? 我不急 在这儿等你
Well, you gotta come out eventually, right?
But I'd take my time in there.

917
00:50:47,638 --> 00:50:49,364
让他急一急
<i>I'd let him sweat.</i>

918
00:50:49,527 --> 00:50:51,694
- 谢谢  - 祝你好运
<i>- Thanks.
- Good luck.</i>

919
00:51:20,528 --> 00:51:22,225
这船棒极了
Yeah, the boat looks great.

920
00:51:22,388 --> 00:51:23,845
但你却糟糕透了
You look like shit.

921
00:51:24,018 --> 00:51:25,840
但是你的船棒极了
But your boat looks great.

922
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:29,647
当然 我住在船上 伙计
Yeah. I live on my boat, man.

923
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:31,852
个人卫生要在窗外解决
Personal hygiene goes out the window.

924
00:51:32,015 --> 00:51:34,192
大部分时间都在这里工作
A lot of time to work on the place.

925
00:51:34,355 --> 00:51:36,109
你该试试在浴室里工作
You should try working on a shower.

926
00:51:36,272 --> 00:51:37,797
是吧
Yeah.

927
00:51:38,123 --> 00:51:41,028
嘿 我该怎么说呢?
Hey, what can I tell you?

928
00:51:41,201 --> 00:51:44,969
- 坚守原则  - 完全明白
Standing on principle, man. It's all I got.

929
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,368
来一根?
Cigarette?

930
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:51,682
不用了
No, I'm good.

931
00:51:51,854 --> 00:51:54,088
很好 你戒了
That's right, you quit.

932
00:51:55,181 --> 00:51:56,610
对你有好处
Good for you.

933
00:52:02,479 --> 00:52:06,439
是Janine派你来监视我的?
So did Janine send you out here
to check up on me?

934
00:52:07,052 --> 00:52:08,769
没错 差不多
Yeah, pretty much.

935
00:52:08,941 --> 00:52:10,725
你要怎么汇报?
What are you gonna tell her?

936
00:52:11,502 --> 00:52:14,560
我要告诉她你在海上享受极了
I'll tell her how gorgeous you look
out here on the ocean.

937
00:52:15,845 --> 00:52:17,753
别开玩笑了
Break.

938
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,652
Beth怎么样了?
Any word from Beth?

939
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:24,389
她忙着她妹妹的葬礼 我想她一定...
She's so busy organizing
her sister's funeral, I think she must be-

940
00:52:24,552 --> 00:52:25,597
妹妹的什么?
Sister's what?

941
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:27,678
她的婚礼 她妹妹的婚礼
Her wedding. Her sister's wedding.

942
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:30,363
- 我刚说的不是婚礼?  - 不 你说的是"葬礼"
- Isn't that what I said?
- No. You said "funeral. "

943
00:52:30,535 --> 00:52:32,031
- 不 我没有  - 不 你有
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

944
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:33,757
我真的说了?
Shit, did I really?

945
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:36,030
太奇怪了
That's so weird.

946
00:52:36,451 --> 00:52:38,590
我真不明白为什么有人想结婚?
I don't understand
why people wanna get married.

947
00:52:40,584 --> 00:52:41,591
他们不想
They don't.

948
00:52:41,764 --> 00:52:43,221
- 他们不想?  - 没错
- They don't?
- No.

949
00:52:43,748 --> 00:52:46,616
事实上 没有男人想结婚
No, no guy actually wants to get married.

950
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:49,857
如果他们要结婚 他们真的考虑清楚了吗?
And if they do,
all they're really thinking about?

951
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,119
他们会错过全天下的女人
All the women
they're gonna miss out on.

952
00:52:52,292 --> 00:52:54,392
我不想和别人一起 我只想和Beth一起
I don't wanna be with anybody else,
just Beth.

953
00:52:56,195 --> 00:52:57,978
我不知道 我...
I don't know, man, I...

954
00:52:58,141 --> 00:52:59,743
你为什么结婚?
Why'd you get married?

955
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:03,712
我爱Janine
I love Janine.

956
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:05,429
你是个快乐的已婚男人
You're a happily married guy.

957
00:53:06,177 --> 00:53:07,797
是的
Yeah.

958
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:09,907
没错 我想是的
Yeah, I'd say so.

959
00:53:16,158 --> 00:53:18,230
现在 我想我没必要多此一举的告诉大家
Now, I know I don't need
to tell any of you...

960
00:53:18,402 --> 00:53:21,912
我的表妹Paige很辣
...that my cousin Paige is hot.

961
00:53:23,705 --> 00:53:26,812
上高中时 如果我告诉那些帅哥Paige是我的表妹
In high school, if I told the popular guys
that Paige was my cousin...

962
00:53:26,975 --> 00:53:28,950
他们会追着我的屁股后面跑
...it'd keep me
from getting my ass kicked...

963
00:53:29,113 --> 00:53:31,731
因为没人想错失和她相处的机会
...because no one wanted
to blow their chances with her.

964
00:53:33,246 --> 00:53:37,714
当她站在那儿说要嫁给Devon时
And when she gets up there
and says those marriage vows to Devon...

965
00:53:37,887 --> 00:53:40,466
世上不知又有多少颗心破碎了
...there will be hearts breaking
all over the world.

966
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:42,422
听听，多甜蜜
Hear, hear.
That's sweet.

967
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:48,952
但是 不要忘了她的姐姐Beth还待价而沽呢
But, you know, keep in mind
that her sister Beth is still on the market.

968
00:53:50,074 --> 00:53:52,692
没错 也许她是位上了年纪的模特
Yeah, sure, she may be an older model...

969
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:55,472
但离掉价还有一段距离
...but she got a lot of good miles
left in that tank.

970
00:53:55,635 --> 00:53:57,294
但是不要待的太久了
But don't stay on the lot too long...

971
00:53:57,467 --> 00:54:00,276
新的模特们会在出现 抢走所有风头...
...or next year's models are gonna
slip in there and steal all-

972
00:54:00,439 --> 00:54:02,347
好了 发言到此为止
Okay, that's enough of the speeches.

973
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,498
好吧
Okay.

974
00:54:03,671 --> 00:54:05,493
大家享用螃蟹吧
So enjoy the crab.

975
00:54:05,656 --> 00:54:11,150
这个黄色的东西可不是芥末酱 它是螃蟹的胰腺
And that yellow stuff is not hot mustard,
it's the crab's hepatopancreas.

976
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,858
Bethie.

977
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,924
你表弟Jay一直是个不分轻重的傻小子
Your cousin Jay
has always been a jackass.

978
00:54:20,087 --> 00:54:21,065
我知道
I know.

979
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:23,692
但就连他都结婚了
And somehow even he's married.

980
00:54:25,169 --> 00:54:27,374
亲爱的 听我说
Oh, honey, look.

981
00:54:27,537 --> 00:54:30,855
有一次 当大家只是要去某地露营时
Back when everyone
was just going to camp at the Y...

982
00:54:31,027 --> 00:54:32,936
你借去我的纽约时报
<i>...you borrowed my New York Times...</i>

983
00:54:33,108 --> 00:54:35,371
发现波克夏有一个艺术野营
...found some arts camp
in the Berkshires...

984
00:54:35,534 --> 00:54:38,574
你自己寄了封信给咨询处 拿到了入营证
...wrote away for information
and got accepted on your own.

985
00:54:38,737 --> 00:54:41,287
你总是独树一帜
You never did things like everyone else.

986
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,697
为什么呢?
Why not?

987
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,327
因为这就是你
Because that's you.

988
00:54:44,845 --> 00:54:47,568
这就是为什么我最喜欢你这个女儿
That's why you're my favorite daughter.

989
00:54:48,143 --> 00:54:50,512
你不该说这种话
You're not supposed to say that.

990
00:54:50,665 --> 00:54:52,430
我不在乎
I don't give a shit.

991
00:54:52,593 --> 00:54:55,009
我退休了 我想说什么就说什么
I'm retired, I'll say what I want to.

992
00:54:55,182 --> 00:54:57,090
如果你想 我会对整个屋子里的人这样说
I'll say it to the whole room if you want.

993
00:54:57,262 --> 00:54:59,909
等等 等等 等等! 过来 停下
Wait, wait, wait! Come here. Stop.

994
00:55:00,072 --> 00:55:01,865
是实话
It's true, though.

995
00:55:18,473 --> 00:55:19,451
嘿
Hey.

996
00:55:21,225 --> 00:55:23,392
- 你在干嘛?  - 等你
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for you.

997
00:55:26,987 --> 00:55:28,742
过来
Come on.

998
00:55:32,904 --> 00:55:33,920
不好意思 我迟到了
Sorry I'm late.

999
00:55:34,083 --> 00:55:35,358
没事 没关系
No, it's okay.

1000
00:55:35,521 --> 00:55:37,382
相亲前 我习惯早到
I like a little time before a blind date.

1001
00:55:37,545 --> 00:55:41,083
打起精神 提醒自己不要泄露磨牙的事...
Prepare myself mentally, remind myself
not to tell the story about my molars...

1002
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:42,435
Gigi 他不来了
Gigi, he's not coming.

1003
00:55:42,598 --> 00:55:45,666
但是你可以告诉我你磨牙的事 我想听
But you can tell me the story
about the molars. I'd love to hear it.

1004
00:55:45,829 --> 00:55:47,517
嘿
Hey.

1005
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,310
还没见面 就已经不喜欢我了?
How could he already not like me?

1006
00:55:49,473 --> 00:55:52,570
是我搞砸了 我告诉Bill今天是星期四 是我的错
I screwed up. I told Bill it was Thursday,
not Tuesday. It's my fault.

1007
00:55:52,743 --> 00:55:54,085
嗨 你还好吗?
Hi. Are you good?

1008
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:56,252
- 能给我杯加冰的詹姆士威士忌吗?  - 没问题
- Can I get a Jameson on the rocks?
- Sure.

1009
00:55:58,918 --> 00:56:02,207
可怕 我要和一个分不清是星期几的人相亲
Awesome. I'm stuck with a guy who
can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday.

1010
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:06,301
你看 那个女孩 她可能遇见了她的真命天子
Meanwhile, this girl, she's probably
meeting her soul mate as we speak.

1011
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:07,874
- 就是那个女孩?  - 嗯
- This one right here?
- Mm-hm.

1012
00:56:08,037 --> 00:56:09,437
哦 天哪 不是
Oh, God, no.

1013
00:56:10,108 --> 00:56:11,738
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

1014
00:56:12,476 --> 00:56:14,337
那个男的 装得像汤姆克鲁斯似的?
The guy working the Tom Cruise thing?

1015
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,734
她对他很有兴趣 但他完全没有
She's interested, he's clearly not.

1016
00:56:16,897 --> 00:56:19,764
你不能匆匆一瞥 就说他没兴趣
You cannot tell from a cursory glance
that he's not into her.

1017
00:56:19,936 --> 00:56:22,487
事实上 我能 这种事我每晚都屡见不鲜
Actually, I can.
I see this stuff going on every night.

1018
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:25,105
看着 她继续说着无趣的话题
Watch this. She's going on
about her macrobiotic diet.

1019
00:56:25,277 --> 00:56:27,444
而他在想 "上帝啊 让我脱身吧"
He's thinking,
"Dear Christ, get me out of here. "

1020
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:28,950
看 多么美妙的意外
And look, how fortuitous.

1021
00:56:29,113 --> 00:56:31,673
酒洒出来了 真是完美 因为现在...
Drinks spill, which is perfect for him,
because now...

1022
00:56:31,836 --> 00:56:34,003
他可以去肩膀上有纹身的女孩那儿了
He can move on to the girl
with the shoulder tattoo.

1023
00:56:35,259 --> 00:56:36,985
大哥 你太有才了
Man, you have a gift.

1024
00:56:37,148 --> 00:56:39,152
现在 看看另一边的可怜虫
Now check out Droopy Dog
on the other side.

1025
00:56:39,325 --> 00:56:43,189
他会给她买单 但她坚信和他擦不出火花
He's gonna buy her drinks all night and
she's still gonna insist there's no spark.

1026
00:56:43,352 --> 00:56:45,395
也许不是 你需要一点火花
Maybe there's not. You need a spark.

1027
00:56:45,558 --> 00:56:48,281
哦 火花这种事就是胡说八道
Oh, the spark thing is bullshit.

1028
00:56:48,444 --> 00:56:49,968
- 真的?  - 胡说八道
- Really?
- Bullshit.

1029
00:56:50,141 --> 00:56:51,416
教教我

Enlighten me.

1030
00:56:51,579 --> 00:56:53,171
男人发明了火花这一说
Guys invented the spark...

1031
00:56:53,334 --> 00:56:57,016
因为这样 他们就可以不打电话 可以对你很冷淡 让你捉摸不透
...so they could not call and treat you
kind of badly and keep you guessing...

1032
00:56:57,179 --> 00:57:00,756
然后哄你相信 你对此自然而然产生的焦虑和害怕
...then convince you that that anxiety
and fear that just develops naturally...

1033
00:57:00,919 --> 00:57:02,443
是一种火花
...was actually just a spark.

1034
00:57:02,616 --> 00:57:05,684
而你们这些女人照单全收 完全相信 还很喜欢
And you guys all buy it.
You eat it up and you love it.

1035
00:57:05,847 --> 00:57:08,916
你们喜欢是因为你们偶像剧看多了 就喜欢这种情节
You love it because you feed off
that drama. You all love that drama.

1036
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:10,057
我不这样
I don't.

1037
00:57:10,229 --> 00:57:13,423
那么你从来没有等到交稿或电话账单的最后期限?
So you never wait until the last minute
on a deadline or a phone bill...

1038
00:57:13,586 --> 00:57:15,407
你要知道自己是否能成功
...because secretly you love the drama...

1039
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:17,939
所以才喜欢这种情节
...of not knowing whether or not
you're gonna make it?

1040
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,144
也许是吧
Maybe.

1041
00:57:20,307 --> 00:57:21,832
我猜猜看
And let me guess:

1042
00:57:22,004 --> 00:57:24,143
那晚你和Conor见完面后
When you were stalking Conor
the other night...

1043
00:57:24,306 --> 00:57:26,377
你有没有一遍又一遍
...were you obsessing
about him calling...

1044
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:29,647
时刻关注他的来电 一连几天紧盯着电话
...constantly pacing back and forth,
staring at your phone for days...

1045
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:32,197
甚至会想 这次约会就这样了?
...even though the date
was just kind of mediocre?

1046
00:57:34,163 --> 00:57:36,052
好吧 没错
Okay. Yeah.

1047
00:57:36,205 --> 00:57:38,766
因为你期待电视剧里的情节 谢谢
Because you all thrive on the drama.
Thank you.

1048
00:57:38,929 --> 00:57:41,642
听着 你该学学我 如果一个女孩喜欢我 很好
Look, you gotta be more like me.
If a girl likes me, great.

1049
00:57:41,805 --> 00:57:44,874
但如果她不喜欢我 外面女孩还多的是 明白?
But if not, there are plenty more
out there like her, you know?

1050
00:57:45,037 --> 00:57:46,983
不要在一棵树上吊死
With smaller pores and bigger implants.

1051
00:57:47,443 --> 00:57:49,860
- 说的太好了  - 我知道
- That's beautiful.
- I know.

1052
00:57:50,032 --> 00:57:53,513
你为什么总是教我这些约会的技巧?
Why are you sharing all of this inside
dating information with me again?

1053
00:57:53,676 --> 00:57:55,431
不知道 我喜欢你
I don't know, I like you.

1054
00:57:56,687 --> 00:57:57,665
真的?
You do?

1055
00:57:59,698 --> 00:58:03,111
是 但别在本子里划满我的名字 好吗?
Well, yeah. Okay, don't start doodling
my name on your binder, okay?

1056
00:58:03,274 --> 00:58:07,139
我只是... 我就像喜欢猎犬那样喜欢你
I just mean- I mean, I like you
the way I like basset hounds.

1057
00:58:07,311 --> 00:58:09,987
有时你可怜他们 想让他们振作起来
Something pathetic about them.
You just wanna cheer them up.

1058
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:12,096
再说一说! 很实用
Again with the sensitivity.

1059
00:58:12,681 --> 00:58:14,206
敬实用
To sensitivity.

1060
00:58:21,253 --> 00:58:22,941
看上去不错
It looks good.

1061
00:58:23,104 --> 00:58:24,485
是的
Yeah.

1062
00:58:24,648 --> 00:58:26,105
不错
Yeah.

1063
00:58:26,949 --> 00:58:29,567
- 他手艺不错啊  - 的确
- He does good work.
- Yeah, he does.

1064
00:58:31,552 --> 00:58:33,211
真不错
Very nice.

1065
00:58:36,998 --> 00:58:38,686
真不错
Very nice.

1066
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:43,892
- Javier?  - 嗯
- Javier?
- Yeah.

1067
00:58:45,532 --> 00:58:46,913
Javier...

1068
00:58:47,555 --> 00:58:50,202
如果我问你一个问题
...if I asked you an honest question...

1069
00:58:50,365 --> 00:58:52,704
你会坦率的回答我吗?
...do you think you could
give me an honest answer?

1070
00:58:52,867 --> 00:58:55,706
- 当然会  - 很好 很好
- I think so.
- Good, good.

1071
00:58:56,224 --> 00:58:59,963
我怀疑你的人在抽烟
Because I think some of your guys
might be smoking.

1072
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,360
Javier?

1073
00:59:02,523 --> 00:59:04,249
- 这是个问题?  - 是的
- Is that the question?
- Yes.

1074
00:59:04,412 --> 00:59:06,867
- 听上去像是陈述  - 其中暗含疑问
- Seemed like a statement.
- The question part's implied.

1075
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,370
我听不出其中有疑问的语气
I really didn't hear it in the inflection.

1076
00:59:09,533 --> 00:59:10,808
Javier...

1077
00:59:11,613 --> 00:59:13,234
你的人到底
...have you guys been smoking...

1078
00:59:13,752 --> 00:59:15,094
有没有抽烟?
...or not?

1079
00:59:16,763 --> 00:59:20,272
不会的 夫人 他们不会在工作场所抽烟的 他们很守纪律
No, ma'am. My guys, they don't smoke
on the job site. They're good guys.

1080
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,871
你确定你的人
Are you sure your guys haven't been...

1081
00:59:23,034 --> 00:59:25,268
从来没有躲起来
...sneaking around here?

1082
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:26,447
抽烟?
And smoking?

1083
00:59:27,445 --> 00:59:29,487
或者说谎?
And lying to me?

1084
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:30,868
对抽烟的事?
And smoking?

1085
00:59:31,031 --> 00:59:32,047
我保证他们没有抽烟
I'm pretty sure.

1086
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:34,550
我需要你说实话 Javier
I need you to be honest with me, Javier.

1087
00:59:34,713 --> 00:59:36,985
因为我不喜欢别人骗我
Because I can't have someone
lying to me.

1088
00:59:37,139 --> 00:59:40,437
当着我的面 站在我的房檐下 占用我的时间
To my face, under my roof,
on my time.

1089
00:59:41,013 --> 00:59:42,288
规矩还挺多
That's a lot of prepositions.

1090
00:59:42,451 --> 00:59:46,929
我是说 其实没必要说谎 对吗?
I mean, there's no reason
for that kind of dishonesty, is there?

1091
00:59:47,092 --> 00:59:50,285
我们双方有承诺
I mean, we made promises to each other.

1092
00:59:51,512 --> 00:59:53,488
我们签了合同
I mean, we have a contract.

1093
00:59:53,651 --> 00:59:56,518
这就是一份承诺 不是吗?
That's like making promises. Isn't it?

1094
00:59:58,646 --> 01:00:00,305
也许我该回去开工了
Maybe I should get back to work.

1095
01:00:02,645 --> 01:00:04,582
是的 没错
Oh, yeah. Right, yeah.

1096
01:00:04,754 --> 01:00:07,027
很好
That's great, yeah.

1097
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:09,740
- Javier?  - 嗯
- Javier?
- Yeah.

1098
01:00:10,642 --> 01:00:13,058
我们没事吧 对吗? 你和我
We're good. Right? You and me.

1099
01:00:13,873 --> 01:00:16,107
- 是 是的 没事  - 很好
- Oh, yeah, yeah. We're good.
- Oh, good.

1100
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,035
很好
Okay, that's great.

1101
01:00:18,188 --> 01:00:20,135
他工作做的很好
Yeah, he did great work.

1102
01:00:25,293 --> 01:00:26,665
嘿
Hey.

1103
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:30,634
欢迎大家 感谢大家的到来 我是Conor
Welcome, everybody.
Thanks for coming. I'm Conor.

1104
01:00:30,797 --> 01:00:33,223
有空请来签个名 请大家把这儿当成自己的家
Sign in when you get a second.
Make yourselves at home.

1105
01:00:33,386 --> 01:00:36,455
我们准备了一些糕点 冰饮 请自便
We got some cookies over here,
some cold beverages. Help yourself.

1106
01:00:36,618 --> 01:00:39,072
Conor 你真是房地产界的Liza Minnelli
Conor, you are the Liza Minnelli
of real estate.

1107
01:00:39,245 --> 01:00:42,860
- 你朋友Mary真是个天才 - 我知道 她很棒
- I know. Your friend Mary's a genius.
- I know, she's so great.

1108
01:00:43,982 --> 01:00:47,300
我得走了 我想 要说再见了
Well, I gotta go,
so I guess I'll see you later.

1109
01:00:47,463 --> 01:00:48,748
什么 你还有课?
What, you got a class, or...?

1110
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:52,132
是的 不 就是有点事
Yeah. No. No, just something.

1111
01:00:52,295 --> 01:00:54,635
- 要做  - 好吧...
- Stuff I gotta do.
Okay. Well...

1112
01:00:54,798 --> 01:00:57,636
- 再见  - 好吧
- I'll see you. Okay. Bye.
- Okay.

1113
01:00:57,799 --> 01:00:59,976
好了 再见
Okay. Bye.

1114
01:01:00,139 --> 01:01:01,961
- 再见  - 好 给我打电话
- See you later.
All right. Call me.

1115
01:01:06,151 --> 01:01:07,129
怎么了?
What?

1116
01:01:08,357 --> 01:01:10,782
她有事瞒着你 对吧?
She's holding out on you, isn't she?

1117
01:01:12,547 --> 01:01:14,436
不知道你在说什么
Not quite sure I get your meaning.

1118
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:16,603
很明显她不会和你上床
It's obvious she won't sleep with you.

1119
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:20,026
一切都写在你可怜的脸上
It's written all over your puppy-dog face.

1120
01:01:21,541 --> 01:01:24,389
- 我很难过 我快死了  - 来块饼干吧
- It's killing me, literally. I'm dying.
- Here, have a cookie.

1121
01:01:24,552 --> 01:01:25,923
不用 我很冷静
No, I'm cool.

1122
01:01:26,086 --> 01:01:28,637
我不知道她在做什么 读不懂她
I don't know what she's doing.
I cannot read her signals.

1123
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,593
我们以前一直睡在一起
We used to sleep together all the time.

1124
01:01:33,383 --> 01:01:35,454
骗你们的 不知道我为什么那么说
That's not true.
I don't know why I said that.

1125
01:01:35,617 --> 01:01:38,964
虽然不是一直 但我们的确睡过 不完全是编的
It wasn't all the time, but it happened.
I know I'm not just making this up.

1126
01:01:39,136 --> 01:01:41,850
接着莫名其妙就结束了 但她还会给我打电话
And then out of nowhere it just stops.
But she still calls.

1127
01:01:42,013 --> 01:01:45,081
她想让我帮她按摩 她就给我留言
She wants a massage.
She leaves cute messages.

1128
01:01:45,254 --> 01:01:47,642
但没有其它发展 她在干嘛?
But it's not going anywhere.
What is she doing?

1129
01:01:47,805 --> 01:01:50,624
实话说 我俩也看不出来
Honestly, we may not
have the best insight.

1130
01:01:50,787 --> 01:01:53,635
同性恋之间的暗示和异性恋不一样
Gay signals have nothing
to do with straight signals.

1131
01:01:53,788 --> 01:01:56,444
对 完全不一样
He's right.
The signals are totally different.

1132
01:01:56,607 --> 01:02:00,184
比如暗示 "我想和你上床"
Like, here.
Here's "I wanna sleep with you. "

1133
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:03,636
一 二 三
One, two, three.

1134
01:02:03,808 --> 01:02:06,042
就这样 三秒钟左右 就成了
That's it, three seconds or more, it's on.

1135
01:02:06,205 --> 01:02:08,727
再如暗示 "我不想和你上床"
And here's
"I don't wanna sleep with you. "

1136
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:10,357
一 二...
One, two...

1137
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:13,081
- 不 我不玩 走开  - 就这么简单
- Nope, thanks for playing, move along.
- It's that simple.

1138
01:02:14,394 --> 01:02:16,216
对 这些帮不了我
You're right, that didn't help me at all.

1139
01:02:16,379 --> 01:02:18,172
嗯 不过 我可以告诉你:
All right, well, I can tell you this:

1140
01:02:18,335 --> 01:02:21,202
不管同性恋还是异性恋 不主动就完蛋
Gay or straight, you're not gonna
get anywhere by being inactive.

1141
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:24,530
她喜欢你 也许她希望你拿出男子气 采取行动
She likes you. Maybe she just wants you
to be a man and do something.

1142
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:29,554
给我拿块葡萄干饼 好吗?
Hit me up with an oatmeal raisin,
will you?

1143
01:02:29,717 --> 01:02:32,018
- 谢谢  - 给
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

1144
01:02:35,317 --> 01:02:37,177
如果女孩喜欢你 就会和你上床
<i>If a girl's into you,
she's sleeping with you.</i>

1145
01:02:37,973 --> 01:02:40,658
如果一个月后 至多两个月后...
If after a month,
or two months at the very outside...

1146
01:02:40,821 --> 01:02:42,796
... 她不和你上床?
...she's not sleeping with you?

1147
01:02:43,419 --> 01:02:45,203
她就不喜欢你
She doesn't like you.

1148
01:02:45,654 --> 01:02:47,380
办法是尽早看懂一个女孩
The trick is to spot this girl early.

1149
01:02:47,543 --> 01:02:51,321
不要浪费一到七周的时间 却一无所获
Don't wanna waste the one to seven weeks
waiting to find out it's never gonna happen.

1150
01:02:51,474 --> 01:02:55,156
所以我总结了助于读懂女孩的迹象
So I've come up with some signs
about how to spot this girl.

1151
01:02:56,307 --> 01:02:58,512
以下迹象说明她不会和你上床
A girl will never sleep with you...

1152
01:02:58,675 --> 01:03:01,609
她叫你"小可爱"或"可靠男"
...if she calls you "cuddly"
or "dependable. "

1153
01:03:01,935 --> 01:03:03,853
她在你面前挤粉刺...
If she pops a zit in front of you...

1154
01:03:04,371 --> 01:03:07,401
... 她说她名叫Amber或Christine...
...if her name is Amber or Christine...

1155
01:03:07,794 --> 01:03:09,683
... 她在你浴室上大号...
...if she takes a dump in your bathroom...

1156
01:03:09,846 --> 01:03:13,288
...她把约会没吃完的打包回家 一次 两次 或三次
...or she takes home leftovers
on dates one, two, or three.

1157
01:03:13,461 --> 01:03:15,820
我知道这不科学...
I know it's not scientific...

1158
01:03:15,983 --> 01:03:18,159
...但我还是要说 悠着点儿
...but I'm just saying,
you were warned.

1159
01:03:39,437 --> 01:03:40,415
等等 停一下
Wait, stop.

1160
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,548
怎么了?
What?

1161
01:03:45,228 --> 01:03:46,887
见鬼
Shit.

1162
01:03:47,664 --> 01:03:48,642
怎么了?
What?

1163
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:52,516
我深深被你吸引了
I am so into you.

1164
01:03:53,456 --> 01:03:55,421
说实话 我从未有过这感觉
Seriously, I've never felt like this before.

1165
01:03:55,757 --> 01:03:59,103
我必须让自己停止想你
I have to actively stop my brain
from thinking about you.

1166
01:03:59,592 --> 01:04:01,664
一直在努力
Like, all the time.

1167
01:04:05,068 --> 01:04:06,410
为什么要停止?
Why stop?

1168
01:04:09,421 --> 01:04:11,358
因为我不做这样的事
Because I don't do stuff like this.

1169
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:13,314
什么事?
Stuff like what?

1170
01:04:15,145 --> 01:04:16,967
和妻子以外的女人们上床
Like sleep with women
that aren't my wife.

1171
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:21,349
首先 我不是女人们 是一个女人
First of all, I am not "women,"
I'm just one.

1172
01:04:21,992 --> 01:04:23,296
其次呢?
And second of all?

1173
01:04:24,936 --> 01:04:26,460
没有其次
Oh, I didn't have a second of all.

1174
01:04:26,633 --> 01:04:29,308
我还期待这"其次"会让我好受些
I was hoping "second of all"
would make me feel better.

1175
01:04:33,796 --> 01:04:35,704
其次...
Second of all...

1176
01:04:36,643 --> 01:04:39,578
... 我也无法停止想你
...I can't stop thinking about you either.

1177
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:54,776
他为了我离开他妻子 真疯狂
He's totally leaving his wife for me.
That's crazy.

1178
01:04:54,948 --> 01:04:56,952
太疯狂了 我们彼此还不太了解
That's crazy. We hardly know each other.

1179
01:04:57,115 --> 01:04:59,091
我不懂 看看Becca
I don't know. I mean, look at Becca.

1180
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:00,826
我妹妹的朋友
You know, my sister's friend.

1181
01:05:00,989 --> 01:05:02,648
在餐厅遇见一个服务生...
One guy waits on her at Bennigan's...

1182
01:05:02,811 --> 01:05:05,975
... 一顿饭后 他俩就知道彼此找到了真爱
...and by the end of the meal,
they both knew they had found the one.

1183
01:05:07,011 --> 01:05:10,425
对 你是对的 这些有可能发生 对吧?
You're right. You're totally right.
I mean, it could happen, right?

1184
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:12,668
不会发生在我身上
Not for me.

1185
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:14,461
那个爱发短信的家伙呢?
What about texter?

1186
01:05:14,624 --> 01:05:17,204
和他都是文字接触
Texter has yet to make verbal contact.

1187
01:05:17,376 --> 01:05:21,174
这家伙可能做过手术 切掉了喉...
I mean, this guy could've had surgery,
leaving him without a voice box...

1188
01:05:21,337 --> 01:05:22,746
... 用气孔呼吸...
...breathing through a stoma...

1189
01:05:22,909 --> 01:05:26,227
... 我不清楚 因为我还没听过他的声音
...and I would never know because
I've never actually heard his voice.

1190
01:05:26,399 --> 01:05:28,250
我怀疑他气孔都没有
Well, I doubt he has a stoma.

1191
01:05:28,413 --> 01:05:31,347
重点是 我讨厌发短信
That's not the point. I can't text.

1192
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,591
你知道 短信展现不出我的魅力
You know, I'm not charming via text.

1193
01:05:33,754 --> 01:05:35,317
那你就别再发短信了
Maybe you should just stop texting.

1194
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:40,236
我不仅讨厌短信 还讨厌电子邮件 语音留言 慢邮
But it's not just texting, it's e-mail.
It's voicemail. It's snail mail.

1195
01:05:40,409 --> 01:05:41,454
都是正常的通讯方式
That's regular mail.

1196
01:05:41,626 --> 01:05:43,285
总之 这些都没用
Whatever. None of it's working.

1197
01:05:43,448 --> 01:05:48,233
曾有个家伙在我公司电话上留言 我回家打给他
I had this guy leave me a voicemail
at work, so I called him at home.

1198
01:05:48,406 --> 01:05:52,663
接着他给我发了手机邮件 所以我又回了短信
And then he e-mailed me to my BlackBerry,
and so I texted to his cell.

1199
01:05:52,826 --> 01:05:57,553
接着他往我家里发电子邮件 一切都失控了
Then he e-mailed me to my home account
and the whole thing just got out of control.

1200
01:05:57,716 --> 01:06:02,770
我好怀念只有一个电话号码 一部电话应答机的日子
And I miss the days where you had one
phone number and one answering machine.

1201
01:06:02,933 --> 01:06:05,579
电话应答机只能放一盒录音带...
And that one answering machine
housed one cassette tape...

1202
01:06:05,752 --> 01:06:09,261
... 录音带里要么有 要么没有男人的口信
...and that one cassette tape either
had a message from the guy or it didn't.

1203
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:12,493
而现在必须查看所有的通讯方式...
And now you have to go around
checking all these different portals...

1204
01:06:12,656 --> 01:06:15,590
... 还常常操作不成功
...just to get rejected
by seven different technologies.

1205
01:06:15,762 --> 01:06:17,517
太累了
It's exhausting.

1206
01:06:17,968 --> 01:06:20,039
那个上MySpace的家伙呢?
What about that MySpace guy?

1207
01:06:20,211 --> 01:06:22,666
- Jude 我喜欢他  - 好啊
- Jude. I like him.
- Good.

1208
01:06:23,251 --> 01:06:25,620
我感觉我们心有灵犀
Yeah, I felt like we connected.

1209
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:27,019
不错啊
Great.

1210
01:06:27,278 --> 01:06:29,934
万一她要你吻她呢?
<i>What if she wants you to kiss her?</i>

1211
01:06:30,097 --> 01:06:33,645
那我就不得不吻她
<i>Well, then I guess
I'm just gonna have to kiss her.</i>

1212
01:06:33,808 --> 01:06:35,496
"Amanda Jones可不嫩...
"Amanda Jones is no minor leaguer...

1213
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:38,564
... 不会被你业余级的吻弄得不能自已"
...who'll be swept off her feet
at the touch of your amateur lips. "

1214
01:06:39,983 --> 01:06:41,805
她可是久经情场
<i>This babe has plenty of battle scars.</i>

1215
01:06:42,256 --> 01:06:43,234
你好?
Hello?

1216
01:06:44,490 --> 01:06:45,804
嗨 你在家啊
Oh, hey, you're home.

1217
01:06:46,926 --> 01:06:48,201
不然我该在哪儿?
Where am I supposed to be?

1218
01:06:48,911 --> 01:06:51,174
出去玩? 今天周末
Out, maybe? It's Saturday night.

1219
01:06:51,595 --> 01:06:54,913
你不让我和不喜欢我的男孩出去 结果就没人了
You won't let me go out with guys
who don't like me. It's kind of limiting.

1220
01:06:55,086 --> 01:06:57,253
听着 我只是想给你留个话
Right. Listen, I was just gonna
leave a message.

1221
01:06:57,416 --> 01:06:59,803
我下周末要办个聚会 你会来吧
I'm having a party next weekend.
You should come.

1222
01:07:00,523 --> 01:07:04,301
不知道 Conor会去吗? 会有点尴尬
Oh, I don't know. Won't Conor be there?
Might be kind of awkward.

1223
01:07:04,454 --> 01:07:08,232
他在华盛顿开会 到时会有很多单身男人哦
He's at a real-estate conference in D.C.
But there'll be a lot of single guys.

1224
01:07:08,395 --> 01:07:10,850
那就会碰到更多让我尴尬的人了
So there will be plenty of chances
for me to be awkward.

1225
01:07:11,013 --> 01:07:13,410
别担心 有我呢 我会帮你的
Don't worry, I'll be there.
I'll talk you through it.

1226
01:07:14,695 --> 01:07:15,740
好了 我挂了
Okay, gotta go.

1227
01:07:15,913 --> 01:07:18,847
好像有一堆盘子摔破了 到时候见吧
Someone just dropped like 84,000 plates.
Maybe I'll see you there.

1228
01:07:19,019 --> 01:07:21,349
你真忙 我不该打给你的 不 是你打给我的
You're busy. I shouldn't have called.
You called me.

1229
01:07:21,512 --> 01:07:23,488
- 是的  - 再见
<i>- Yup, good.
- Bye.</i>

1230
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:29,787
怎么...? 怎么做?
<i>How-? How do you work on it?</i>

1231
01:07:30,401 --> 01:07:32,923
把我当成女孩 好吗?
<i>Pretend I'm a girl, okay?</i>

1232
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:35,512
我是说...
<i>I mean...</i>

1233
01:07:36,001 --> 01:07:37,152
... 把我当成那个
<i>...pretend I'm her.</i>

1234
01:07:38,024 --> 01:07:39,616
<i>Amanda.</i>

1235
01:07:42,723 --> 01:07:43,931
他喜欢上我了
He's into me.

1236
01:07:44,103 --> 01:07:46,175
太棒了 我就知道
Awesome. I knew it.

1237
01:07:46,338 --> 01:07:48,198
- 这次是谁?  - Alex
- Who's this now?
- Alex.

1238
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:51,487
我彻底明白了 他是Watts
It's totally clear to me now. He's Watts.

1239
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:54,680
- 他是什么?  - 电影妙不可言的女主角
<i>- He's what?
- From Some Kind of Wonderful.</i>

1240
01:07:54,852 --> 01:07:56,789
Watts是女演员Mary扮演的
I thought Mary Stuart Masterson
was Watts.

1241
01:07:56,962 --> 01:07:59,100
- 对  - 为什么你不是Watts?
- Yes.
- So why aren't you Watts?

1242
01:07:59,685 --> 01:08:01,171
我是男主角Eric Stoltz
I'm Eric Stoltz.

1243
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:05,630
Alex是Watts 因为Watts搓合了男主角和女孩Amanda
Alex is Watts. Watts helps Eric Stoltz
go on a date with Amanda Jones.

1244
01:08:05,793 --> 01:08:07,577
其实她爱着男主角
Really, she's in love with Eric Stoltz.

1245
01:08:08,219 --> 01:08:10,300
所以Amanda是Conor?
So Amanda Jones is Conor?

1246
01:08:11,134 --> 01:08:14,845
也许 总之这不是重点
I guess. At first. Now men in general,
but that's not the point.

1247
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:16,792
重点是他喜欢上我了
The point is he's into me.

1248
01:08:16,955 --> 01:08:20,272
我就知道他花时间陪你 肯定有原因
I knew there had to be some reason why
he was spending that time with you.

1249
01:08:20,445 --> 01:08:23,858
对 很明显 有许多迹象
I know. It's so obvious now.
There are so many signs.

1250
01:08:24,031 --> 01:08:27,349
迹象 爱的迹象 快告诉我 我喜欢听
Signs. Love signs. You gotta
tell me about the signs. I love signs.

1251
01:08:27,512 --> 01:08:31,290
开始不明显 我第一次打给他 他说"很高兴你打来"
First they were small. At first when I
called, he said, "Good to hear from you. "

1252
01:08:31,453 --> 01:08:32,824
- 非常好的迹象  - 是吗?
- Totally good sign.
- Right?

1253
01:08:32,987 --> 01:08:35,509
第二次打去 他正和一个女人...
And then the next time I called
he was with a woman...

1254
01:08:35,672 --> 01:08:38,261
... 但他接了电话 我们聊了一阵
...but he took the call
and we talked for a while.

1255
01:08:38,424 --> 01:08:40,399
- 你怎么知道是女人  - 他叫她"宝贝"
- You know it was a woman?
- Called her "babe. "

1256
01:08:40,572 --> 01:08:44,340
男人不会晾着眼前的女人 去接另一个女人的电话 除非...
Okay, a guy doesn't leave a woman
to go talk to another woman unless he's...

1257
01:08:44,503 --> 01:08:45,778
这就很明显了
And it gets more obvious.

1258
01:08:45,941 --> 01:08:49,777
他介绍给我的男人 并无其人
I mean, please. There was no guy
he was gonna fix me up with.

1259
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:51,349
其实就是他自己
The fix-up was him.

1260
01:08:51,512 --> 01:08:52,596
不会吧
No.

1261
01:08:52,759 --> 01:08:56,537
会 他出现的时候 这个Bill的虚构人物并没来
Yes. He shows up
without this fictitious Bill character.

1262
01:08:56,690 --> 01:08:58,349
倒是我和他来了场约会
The two of us basically have a date.

1263
01:08:58,522 --> 01:09:03,249
接着他打电话邀我参加在他家的聚会
And then he calls and invites me
to a party at his place.

1264
01:09:03,412 --> 01:09:05,713
他果然喜欢你
He so likes you.

1265
01:09:06,711 --> 01:09:09,290
真为你感到高兴
I'm so happy for you.

1266
01:09:09,463 --> 01:09:12,272
我们来为你的婚礼挑个地方
Let's look up places
for your destination wedding.

1267
01:09:15,158 --> 01:09:18,121
喜欢纳帕谷吗?
How do you feel about Napa Valley?

1268
01:09:18,294 --> 01:09:20,365
我一直想去那儿
I have really always wanted to go there.

1269
01:09:23,347 --> 01:09:24,910
噢 他很可爱
Oh, he's cute.

1270
01:09:25,073 --> 01:09:27,403
闷骚又敏感
Yeah. Smoldering but sensitive.

1271
01:09:28,141 --> 01:09:32,303
"我只有一把吉它 和弦 和真心"
Oh. "All I have is my guitar, these chords,
and the truth. "

1272
01:09:32,466 --> 01:09:33,607
Bon Jovi.

1273
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:36,081
- 不错  - 我喜欢他
- That's hot.
- Yeah. I like him.

1274
01:09:36,244 --> 01:09:40,137
可能他没给我打电话 是因为昨晚我们才喝了咖啡
I mean, he probably hasn't called yet
because we just had coffee last night.

1275
01:09:40,655 --> 01:09:42,381
- 是吗?  - 是的
- Really?
Yeah, you know.

1276
01:09:42,544 --> 01:09:45,641
我们视频聊天时 手上正拿着咖啡
I mean, we actually video
iChatted while holding coffee.

1277
01:09:45,804 --> 01:09:47,396
一回事 不是吗?
But that's the same thing, right?

1278
01:09:47,568 --> 01:09:49,601
- 对 对  - 查查你的电话留言
- Right, right.
- Just call your voicemail.

1279
01:09:49,774 --> 01:09:53,484
昨晚他有个演奏会 可能很晚才回家
Yeah, but he had a gig last night
and he probably didn't get home till late.

1280
01:09:53,647 --> 01:09:55,536
- 我告诉你们他是个歌手了吗?  - 嗯
- Did I tell you he's a singer?
- Mm-hm.

1281
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:57,387
- 查一查  - 不 用免提
- Just call.
Oh, honey, no, on speaker.

1282
01:09:57,962 --> 01:10:00,168
别这样 肯定没有留言
I don't think so.
I'm sure he hasn't called.

1283
01:10:00,331 --> 01:10:01,788
- 查一查  - 好吧
- Just call him.
- Okay.

1284
01:10:07,302 --> 01:10:10,620
- 您有两条新留言  - 嗯
<i>You have two new messages.
Oh.</i>

1285
01:10:12,393 --> 01:10:14,282
<i>Mary</i>

1286
01:10:14,445 --> 01:10:18,147
<i>Whoa, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary</i>

1287
01:10:18,665 --> 01:10:21,512
噢 我的Mary
<i>Oh, my Mary</i>

1288
01:10:22,279 --> 01:10:23,622
我刚才太刻薄了
I just got hard.

1289
01:10:23,785 --> 01:10:25,214
嗨 Mary 我是Jude
<i>Hey, Mary, it's Jude.</i>

1290
01:10:25,386 --> 01:10:29,155
我打来是想说 认识你让我有种特别的感觉
<i>I was just calling to tell you again
how special it was to meet you.</i>

1291
01:10:29,318 --> 01:10:32,731
给我回电话 拜拜
<i>So call me back. Bye-bye.</i>

1292
01:10:34,659 --> 01:10:35,771
太棒了
Amazing.

1293
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:38,302
- 太好了 太好了  - 太...
This is good, this is good.
- This is...

1294
01:10:38,465 --> 01:10:39,645
看 他打了
See, he called.

1295
01:10:39,817 --> 01:10:41,438
<i>JUDE
Jenny</i>

1296
01:10:41,601 --> 01:10:45,379
<i>Whoa, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny</i>

1297
01:10:45,542 --> 01:10:48,601
嗨 Jenny 我是Jude 我打来是想告诉你...
<i>Hey, Jenny, it's Jude.
I was just calling to-</i>

1298
01:10:48,773 --> 01:10:52,628
噢 见鬼 这不是刚打过的号吗?
<i>Whoa, shit. What number did I just dial?</i>

留言已清空
<i>All messages erased.</i>

1300
01:11:06,685 --> 01:11:07,673
那个
That one.

1301
01:11:07,836 --> 01:11:08,890
- 确定?  - 嗯
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1302
01:11:10,367 --> 01:11:12,342
错 这是压制板
No. It's a laminate.

1303
01:11:13,311 --> 01:11:15,641
- 不是硬木板?  - 嗯
- That's not real hardwood floor?
- Nope.

1304
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:19,150
看起来很像 不过价钱只有硬木的百分之一
It looks exactly like it. But it is
like one one-hundredth of the cost.

1305
01:11:19,323 --> 01:11:20,474
噢
Oh.

1306
01:11:21,979 --> 01:11:23,676
我还是想要实木的
I still wanna go with the real wood.

1307
01:11:24,443 --> 01:11:26,649
啊? 你连区别都看不出来
What? You can't even tell the difference.

1308
01:11:26,812 --> 01:11:28,471
那不重要
It's not the point.

1309
01:11:29,468 --> 01:11:30,743
那重要的是什么?
Well, what is the point?

1310
01:11:30,906 --> 01:11:32,536
我...
I just...

1311
01:11:32,987 --> 01:11:35,576
我不喜欢它伪装实木
I don't like the way
it's pretending to be wood.

1312
01:11:35,739 --> 01:11:38,222
如果不是实木 就别装得像
If you're not wood,
don't try and look like wood.

1313
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:40,946
我不认为这是伪装
I don't think that it's pretending.

1314
01:11:42,106 --> 01:11:43,698
这是造假 Ben
This is a lie, Ben.

1315
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:47,341
应该站出来 做真正的自己
Just be up front
and tell people what you really are.

1316
01:11:49,019 --> 01:11:51,119
好 你是对的
Okay, you're right. You're right.

1317
01:11:51,292 --> 01:11:52,845
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1318
01:11:55,607 --> 01:11:59,020
好了 我们去看看烤炉就回家吧
It's okay. Maybe we should just go
look at the grills and we'll come back.

1319
01:11:59,931 --> 01:12:00,909
好的
Okay.

1320
01:12:05,272 --> 01:12:07,161
我和别人上床了
I slept with someone.

1321
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:17,421
- 我说...  - 我听见了
- I said-
- I heard you.

1322
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:24,689
你在这里告诉我是因为 你知道我不喜欢公开吵闹
You tell me this in Home Depot
because you know I hate a public scene.

1323
01:12:24,852 --> 01:12:27,432
不 不是这个原因
No, that is not why I'm telling-

1324
01:12:27,921 --> 01:12:29,446
我早知道
I knew it.

1325
01:12:30,318 --> 01:12:31,306
我知道
I knew it.

1326
01:12:31,469 --> 01:12:33,291
- 你这混蛋  - 抱歉
- You asshole.
- I'm sorry.

1327
01:12:35,218 --> 01:12:38,027
烟也是你抽的 对吗?
It is you that's been smoking too,
isn't it?

1328
01:12:38,612 --> 01:12:40,971
啊...? 跟有抽烟有什么关系?
Wha-? Wait, what does that
even matter?

1329
01:12:41,134 --> 01:12:42,764
你是不是...?!
Have you-?!

1330
01:12:44,078 --> 01:12:45,545
你是不是一直在抽烟?
Have you been smoking?

1331
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:46,983
不 没有
No. No, I haven't.

1332
01:12:53,964 --> 01:12:55,210
我和Neil聊过 我告诉他了
I talked to Neil. I told him.

1333
01:12:55,373 --> 01:12:57,099
他说我可以去他船上住阵子
He said I could stay
at his boat for a while.

1334
01:12:57,262 --> 01:12:58,509
你说什么?
Excuse me?

1335
01:12:59,593 --> 01:13:01,606
你现在要搬出去?
Now you're moving out?

1336
01:13:01,769 --> 01:13:03,591
- 你想要离开我?  - 不
- You're, like, leaving me?
- No.

1337
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:06,822
不 我只是以为你不想让我…
No, I just assumed
that you wouldn't want me to-

1338
01:13:07,848 --> 01:13:11,368
我们不解决这个问题吗?
Aren't we gonna deal with this?

1339
01:13:11,531 --> 01:13:15,328
你不想找些方法...
Don't you wanna find some way...

1340
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:18,022
来解决这个问题?
...for us to work through this?

1341
01:13:18,502 --> 01:13:22,251
我以为我告诉你这些 你就会让我...
I assumed that when I told you,
you would want me...

1342
01:13:23,114 --> 01:13:24,092
搬出去
...out.

1343
01:13:26,729 --> 01:13:28,388
这是你想要的吗?
Is that what you want?

1344
01:13:41,121 --> 01:13:42,339
不
No.

1345
01:13:44,679 --> 01:13:45,983
好
Okay.

1346
01:13:46,376 --> 01:13:47,776
好
Okay.

1347
01:14:09,888 --> 01:14:12,275
你们做得很好
You're doing a great job.

1348
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:21,759
哦 天哪 是Bridget 嗨!

啊 好漂亮的狗呀
Oh, what a beautiful dog.

1351
01:14:41,818 --> 01:14:45,644
说真的 Devon 我觉得你刚才在宣誓的时候 有那么一瞬间的犹豫
Seriously, Devon, I really did feel
just a moment, a splash, of hesitation.

1352
01:14:45,817 --> 01:14:48,051
不 不是的 我一点都没犹豫
No, there wasn't.
There wasn't any hesitation at all.

1353
01:14:48,214 --> 01:14:50,189
你又来了 又停顿了
You just did it again. That was a pause.

1354
01:14:50,362 --> 01:14:52,529
我没有停顿
I did not pause.

1355
01:14:58,714 --> 01:15:00,497
你一定是Beth吧
You must be Beth.

1356
01:15:02,837 --> 01:15:04,812
是的
Yeah. Yeah.

1357
01:15:04,985 --> 01:15:07,190
从Paige那听到你很多事
Heard a lot about you from Paige.

1358
01:15:07,737 --> 01:15:11,447
她游说我好几周了 让我一定要在婚礼时和她的单身妹妹坐一起
Actually been lobbying
to sit next to her single sister for weeks.

1359
01:15:11,994 --> 01:15:13,816
是吗?
Oh, yeah?

1360
01:15:13,969 --> 01:15:16,338

So you must be:

1361
01:15:16,501 --> 01:15:18,064
"Dan. "

1362
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:19,953
差不多吧
Sort of.

1363
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:24,018
- 差不多?  - 嗯 实际上我是一个巫术迷信者
- Sort of?
- Well, I'm actually a Wiccan.

1364
01:15:24,181 --> 01:15:25,802
什么？巫术迷信者
- A what?

1366
01:15:27,672 --> 01:15:29,158
- 也就是男巫师  - 好吧
- Male witch.
- Right.

1367
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:31,785
我还有个带有魔法色彩名字
So I also have a magical name.

1368
01:15:32,150 --> 01:15:34,345
就是Brother Phoenix East-Horse
It's Brother Phoenix East-Horse.

1369
01:15:34,518 --> 01:15:37,740
但我不知道这个名字适不适合放在名片上 我很喜欢它
But I didn't know if that would fit
on the card. Love that.

1370
01:15:37,903 --> 01:15:40,425
我猜今晚我会听到很多关于你的事情
I'm guessing that I'm gonna
hear a whole lot about you.

1371
01:15:40,597 --> 01:15:42,985
一些基督诞生前的异教徒事迹 没错
Nature-based
pre-Christian paganism, yeah.

1372
01:15:43,148 --> 01:15:45,066
是的 这太棒了
Yeah. That's fantastic.

1373
01:15:45,229 --> 01:15:46,609
那么从哪儿开始讲起呢?
Well, where to begin?

1374
01:15:46,772 --> 01:15:49,639
首先 那不仅仅是一群无知的农民 我的神啊
Well, first off, it's not just a bunch
of nude farming. Dad.

1375
01:15:49,802 --> 01:15:51,749
- 哇哦  - 来看看史前巨石柱
- Wow.
- Let's look at Stonehenge.

1376
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:53,159
明显不是巧合
Obviously not a coincidence.

1377
01:15:53,331 --> 01:15:56,006
他们没有机器来移动这些石头 它们太巨大了
They didn't have the machinery
to move those rocks. They're huge.

1378
01:15:56,169 --> 01:15:57,119
- 是的 是很重  - 当然
- Yeah, they're heavy.
- Of course.

1379
01:16:26,211 --> 01:16:29,088
- 我是Nathan 这位是Bruce  - 我是Gigi

- Gigi 嗨  - 嗨
- Gigi. Hi.
- Hey.

1381
01:16:32,616 --> 01:16:35,876
你们是怎么认识Alex的?
So how do you guys know Alex?

1382
01:16:37,094 --> 01:16:40,575
不认识 我们的朋友Mary从Conor那知道的
We don't. Our friend Mary heard
about this from some guy named Conor.

1383
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:45,599
你是怎么认识Alex?
And how do you know Alex?

1384
01:16:47,392 --> 01:16:48,955
我希望…
I hope-

1385
01:16:49,281 --> 01:16:52,628
我很肯定我们之间会发生点什么
I'm pretty sure that something's
about to happen between us.

1386
01:16:52,801 --> 01:16:54,268
- 哦噢  - 哦
Ooh.
Oh.

1387
01:16:54,431 --> 01:16:58,046
那你在这 是作为客人 还是他的约会对象?
So are you here as, like, a guest,
or, like, his date?

1388
01:16:58,209 --> 01:17:01,756
我讨厌这样 不知道自己是不是在约会
Oh, I hate that.
When you don't know if you're a date.

1389
01:17:01,919 --> 01:17:05,055
你不知道自己是否应该带朋友来 或者像他一样去招待大家...
You don't know if you should bring
a friend, or are you co-hosting...

1390
01:17:05,218 --> 01:17:07,797
或者是不是应该等到最后 好有些独处时间?
...or should you stay to the end
to have some alone time?

1391
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:10,338
他没说 不过我想可能不仅仅是个客人
He didn't say.
I'm sure I'm more than just a guest.

1392
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:12,918
- 我是说 有很多迹象表明了这一点  - 真棒
- I mean, there have been signs.
- Cool.

1393
01:17:38,136 --> 01:17:39,316
那么Neil去哪了?
So where's Neil?

1394
01:17:39,479 --> 01:17:40,495
我们分手了
We broke up.

1395
01:17:40,668 --> 01:17:42,806
- 不会吧  - 是真的
- No way.
- Yeah.

1396
01:17:43,285 --> 01:17:45,366
你们在一起有十年了吧?
You guys were together,
what, like 10 years?

1397
01:17:45,529 --> 01:17:47,255
七年 但是也是一段很长的时间
Seven. But still, it's a long time.

1398
01:17:47,418 --> 01:17:48,502
是呀
Yeah.

1399
01:17:49,048 --> 01:17:51,829
表亲不能结婚真是太糟了 不然我们就有可能…
It's too bad cousins can't marry,
because then we could maybe-

1400
01:17:51,992 --> 01:17:53,881
Oh, Dominic.

1401
01:17:54,197 --> 01:17:56,173
- 你这个口无遮拦的家伙  - 不
- Gross.
- No.

1402
01:17:58,138 --> 01:17:59,759
Ken 你还好吗? 出了什么事?
Ken, are you okay? What happened?

1403
01:18:02,003 --> 01:18:02,990
哦 天哪
Oh, my God.

1404
01:18:03,163 --> 01:18:05,330
- Ken 你还好吗?  - 他一直抓着自己的胸口
Ken, are you all right?
Just clutched his chest.

1405
01:18:05,493 --> 01:18:07,382
他站在那里 然后突然就…
He was standing there
and all of a sudden-

1406
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:09,491
- Ken 试着呼吸  - 打急救电话
Ken, just try to breathe.
Call 911.

1407
01:18:09,654 --> 01:18:10,728
爸爸 不好意思 请让一下
Dad. Excuse me.

1408
01:18:10,901 --> 01:18:13,289
爸爸 这是怎么回事? 出什么事了? 出什么事了?
Daddy, what is it? What happened?
What happened?

1409
01:18:13,461 --> 01:18:15,312
- 伙计们 过来!  - 怎么了?
- Guys, come here!
What happened?

1410
01:18:15,475 --> 01:18:16,846
爸爸 躺下 好不好?
Daddy, lay down, okay?

1411
01:18:17,009 --> 01:18:18,284
- 他晕倒了吗?  - 你会没事的
Did he fall?
You'll be fine.

1412
01:18:18,447 --> 01:18:21,199
大伙 有没有人看见发生什么事了?
You guys, did anybody
see what happened?

1413
01:18:21,362 --> 01:18:23,788
- 就在那 快去拿过来  C 好的
Over there. Just go get it.
- Okay.

1414
01:18:26,099 --> 01:18:28,266
嘿 嘿 我不知道这里居然这么吵
Hey, hey. I had no idea
it'd be such a madhouse.

1415
01:18:28,439 --> 01:18:29,647
嗨 好棒的聚会
Hey. Great party.

1416
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:32,111

Thanks. Did any guys hit on you?
A lot of them here.

1417
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:34,758
要不要帮你参谋下他们对你的感兴趣程度?
You need me to evaluate
any level of interest?

1418
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:38,056
他们是同性恋 应该对我没什么兴趣
They were gay. Even I know
their level of interest was probably low.

1419
01:18:38,229 --> 01:18:39,207
嗨 Skilo!
Hey, Skilo!

1420
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:42,438

It's too bad Bill couldn't make it.
I know you guys would hit it off.

1421
01:18:42,611 --> 01:18:43,953
好吧 "Bill"
Okay, right. "Bill. "

1422
01:18:45,037 --> 01:18:46,025
是的
Right.

1423
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:54,252
听着 我要去弄些酒 但是食物需要随时补充
Listen, I gotta go make a liquor run,
but the food needs some refreshing.

1424
01:18:54,990 --> 01:18:57,541
- 能不能请你帮忙装...?  - 帮着招待?
- Would you mind helping and refilling-?
- Like co-hosting?

1425
01:18:58,864 --> 01:19:00,897
是的
Okay, yeah.

Thanks.

1429
01:19:09,766 --> 01:19:12,068
- 嗨 甜心 能给我瓶啤酒吗?   - 我去给你拿
Hey, sweetie, get me a beer?
- I'll get you another.

1430
01:19:12,231 --> 01:19:14,599
- 嗨 伙计  - 真棒
- Hi, guys.
- Nice.

1431
01:19:14,762 --> 01:19:16,670
Hey, Linda.

1432
01:19:31,753 --> 01:19:33,959
- 这聚会太棒了  - 哦 谢谢
- Really great party.
- Oh, thanks.

1433
01:19:34,726 --> 01:19:38,302
当Alex说他想办个聚会 我说"那就做吧!"
You know, when Alex said he wanted
to throw a party, I was like, "Let's do it!"

1434
01:19:38,465 --> 01:19:41,150
- 谢谢你们的邀请   - 别客气了 随时欢迎
- Thanks for having us.
- No problem, any time.

1435
01:19:41,956 --> 01:19:43,298
要我帮你找东西吗?
Can I help you find something?

1436
01:19:43,461 --> 01:19:45,436
哦 不用 没关系的 我找到了
Oh, no, it's okay. I got it.

1437
01:19:45,609 --> 01:19:46,980
谢谢你帮忙搅拌
Thanks for mixing that up.

1438
01:19:47,776 --> 01:19:48,792
什么?
What?

1439
01:19:48,965 --> 01:19:52,475
Alex让我把调料搅拌在一起 谢谢你帮忙
Alex asked me to get the dip together.
Thanks for getting it started.

1440
01:19:53,702 --> 01:19:55,390
应该多用一点茴香
It could use a little more dill.

1441
01:19:55,553 --> 01:19:57,211
不过我能搞定 别担心
I'm on it, though, don't worry.

1442
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:02,878
来吧 孩子 把球传到篮下
Come on, my boy. Take it home.

1443
01:20:03,041 --> 01:20:04,796
干得好 我的Marbury
Franchise player. My boy Marbury.

1444
01:20:04,959 --> 01:20:06,522
- 15秒  - 走吧
Fifteen seconds.
Let's go.

1445
01:20:06,685 --> 01:20:08,891
- 哦 通过了  - 你玩得挺认真啊
Oh, a pass.
You work too hard.

1446
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:12,256
我想我已经把剩下的啤酒瓶都集中起来了
Well, I think I've rounded up
the last of the beer bottles.

1447
01:20:13,627 --> 01:20:16,504
- 哦 你们在玩什么?  - 抱歉 Nash
- Oh, what game are we playing?
- Oh, sorry, Nash.

1448
01:20:16,667 --> 01:20:18,805
- 来吧  - 来吧 来吧
- Oh, come on.
- Come on, come on.

1449
01:20:18,978 --> 01:20:22,459
- Nash 你真是个蠢货 来吧  - 或许我应该...
Nash, you piece of shit. Come on.
- Maybe I should just-

1450
01:20:22,622 --> 01:20:24,280
- 现在已经3点多了 所以...  C 好 就这样
- It's past 3, so...
Okay, swat it.

1451
01:20:24,443 --> 01:20:25,824
看这个 准备好了吗?
Watch this. Ready?

1452
01:20:25,978 --> 01:20:27,474
- 然后...  C 哦 不 不 不!
- And...
Oh, no, no, no!

1453
01:20:27,646 --> 01:20:30,714
好 干得好 太棒了
Yes. Suck it. Yes.

1454
01:20:30,878 --> 01:20:32,728
你真是... 你真是太厉害了
Oh, you are- You're sensational.

1455
01:20:32,891 --> 01:20:33,908
- 是的 我知道  - 老天
- Yeah, I know.
- Jesus.

1456
01:20:34,588 --> 01:20:36,084
真不知道我为什么要跟你较量
I don't know why I bother.

1457
01:20:36,257 --> 01:20:38,136
- 你刚才说现在已经3点多了?  - 是的
- Did you say it's past 3?
- Yeah.

1458
01:20:38,299 --> 01:20:41,463
- 哦 朋友 我该走了 嘿 玩得很开心  - 好的
- Oh, man, I gotta go. Hey, good game.
- All right.

1459
01:20:41,626 --> 01:20:43,573
- 再见  - 再见
Bye.
GIGl: Bye.

1460
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:08,590
谢谢你留在这里帮我清理
Hey, thanks for staying
and helping me clean up.

1461
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:11,601
但我真想赶紧上床睡觉去
I really gotta go to bed, though.

1462
01:21:11,764 --> 01:21:13,193
这是个邀请吗?
Is that an invitation?

1463
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:15,024
什么?
What?

1464
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:18,447
哦 老天 这招太俗了
Oh, God, that was cheesy.

1465
01:21:18,869 --> 01:21:21,257
哦 我不太擅长这些
Oh, I'm not good at this.

1466
01:21:21,688 --> 01:21:22,762
什么?
What?

1467
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,648
Hey.

1468
01:21:33,041 --> 01:21:35,151
哦 是的 我知道的
Oh, yes. I knew it.

1469
01:21:35,314 --> 01:21:38,248
最好的恋情是发展自友谊的
The best relationships
grow out of friendships.

1470
01:21:38,421 --> 01:21:40,396
等等 等等 Gigi
Wait, wait, wait. Gigi.

1471
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:43,110
等等 等等 等等
Wait, wait, wait.

1472
01:21:43,282 --> 01:21:44,529
什么?
What?

1473
01:21:44,692 --> 01:21:46,446
现在你跟我在谈恋爱?
Now you and I are in a relationship?

1474
01:21:46,609 --> 01:21:50,349
恩 我想说 即使我们不是在谈恋爱...
Well, I'd say if we're not
at relationship station-ship...

1475
01:21:50,512 --> 01:21:51,922
至少我们已经朝这方面发展了
...we're at least on the track.

1476
01:21:53,264 --> 01:21:56,131
为什么你会这么想?
And why exactly would you think that?

1477
01:21:56,304 --> 01:21:57,991
因为这些信号
Because of the signs.

1478
01:21:58,538 --> 01:21:59,852
是吗 比如什么?
Really, like what?

1479
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:03,112
比如 你说接到我的来电很高兴...
Like, it was good to hear from me...

1480
01:22:03,275 --> 01:22:06,506
当你跟其他女孩在一起时还跟我聊天...
...and you talked to me
even when you were with a girl...

1481
01:22:06,669 --> 01:22:09,258
我能感觉到
...and I felt something.

1482
01:22:09,776 --> 01:22:11,627
哦 天
Oh, man.

1483
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:12,998
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

1484
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:16,325
Gigi 不记得我都跟你说过些什么吗?
Gigi, what have I been saying
since I met you?

1485
01:22:16,488 --> 01:22:20,007
如果男人想约你 他会主动 对不? 他会约你出去
If a guy wants to date you, he will make
it happen, okay? He will ask you out.

1486
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:21,311
我约你了吗?
Did I ask you out?

1487
01:22:22,539 --> 01:22:23,584
没有
No.

1488
01:22:23,756 --> 01:22:26,173
你为什么这么做?
Why would you do this?

1489
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:28,359
哦 真该死
Oh, shit.

1490
01:22:28,522 --> 01:22:31,101
为什么女人会这样? 这样想当然...
Why do women do this?
Build up this stuff in their minds...

1491
01:22:31,274 --> 01:22:34,985
把男人做的一点点小事曲解成别的东西?
...take each little thing a guy does,
and then twist it into something else?

1492
01:22:35,148 --> 01:22:36,768
简直不可理喻
It's insane.

1493
01:22:46,721 --> 01:22:49,656
我宁愿那样 也不想像你一样
I'd rather be like that than be like you.

1494
01:22:51,688 --> 01:22:52,858
你说什么?
Excuse me?

1495
01:22:53,031 --> 01:22:54,920
那是什么意思?
What is that supposed to mean?

1496
01:22:57,192 --> 01:22:59,772
我可能是很喜欢仔细琢磨每件小事...
I may dissect each little thing...

1497
01:22:59,935 --> 01:23:02,869
翻来覆去地想 ...
...and put myself out there too much...

1498
01:23:03,041 --> 01:23:05,276
但至少代表我还在乎
...but at least that means I still care.

1499
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:11,067
哦 你以为不在乎女人就是赢了?
Oh, you think you've won
because women are expendable to you?

1500
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:15,392
这样你也许不会伤害到你自己或者让自己出丑...
You may not get hurt
or make an ass of yourself that way...

1501
01:23:15,555 --> 01:23:18,134
但同时你也不会尝到爱情的滋味
...but you don't fall in love
that way either.

1502
01:23:18,307 --> 01:23:19,966
你没有赢
You have not won.

1503
01:23:20,129 --> 01:23:22,200
你还是一个人 Alex
You're alone, Alex.

1504
01:23:28,672 --> 01:23:30,935
我可能做了该死的蠢事...
I may do a lot of stupid shit...

1505
01:23:31,098 --> 01:23:35,413
但我知道我会比你更快找到另一半
...but I know I'm a lot closer
to finding someone than you are.

1506
01:23:43,132 --> 01:23:45,174
还要别的吗?
Do you want anything else?

1507
01:23:45,337 --> 01:23:48,655
当然 少一些硬纸板 多些人吃的东西
Yeah, less of the cardboard crap
and more regular people food.

1508
01:23:48,828 --> 01:23:53,229
嗯 那个硬纸板是我们常说的全麦吐司
Well, that cardboard crap
is what we call whole-wheat toast.

1509
01:23:53,622 --> 01:23:56,978
或许你能给我煎一些香肠
Well, maybe you could just fry me up
a couple of sausage links.

1510
01:23:57,141 --> 01:24:00,142
对于刚刚突发心脏病的人来说...
People who have just had a heart attack
are generally not advised...

1511
01:24:00,315 --> 01:24:03,633
最好不要吃这种富含动物脂肪的东西
...to have animal fat that's been stuffed
into a synthetic casing.

1512
01:24:13,912 --> 01:24:17,421
嗨 Beth 去厨房的时候给我拿瓶啤酒 好吗?
Hey, Beth. Grab me a beer
when you get to the kitchen, okay?

1513
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:20,308
再来一点冷盘 如果还有剩的话
And a little plate of cold cuts,
if there are any left.

1514
01:24:20,471 --> 01:24:23,855
你们这些家伙能不能把声音关小点? 爸爸要睡了
Hey, would you guys please just turn
that down a bit? Dad's trying to sleep.

1515
01:24:24,018 --> 01:24:25,927
你觉得他会舍不得这些黑胶碟吗?
You think he wants
to hang on to this vinyl?

1516
01:24:26,099 --> 01:24:28,046
我很希望它们加入我的藏品行列
My collection could use a lot of these.

1517
01:24:28,209 --> 01:24:30,452
该死 能不能关掉?
Would you just turn it the fuck down?

1518
01:24:33,588 --> 01:24:35,976
我们的卫生纸用完了...
Well, we're totally out of toilet paper...

1519
01:24:36,148 --> 01:24:40,588
能吃的也只有果冻和一些意大利面
...and all we have left to eat
is some old jelly and some ramen noodles.

1520
01:24:40,751 --> 01:24:45,229
爸爸都还没死呢 我们的新兄弟就想分财产了
And our new brother would like to co-opt
Dad's property before he's even dead.

1521
01:24:45,392 --> 01:24:48,393
Laura你的老公还想再要瓶啤酒...
Laura, also your husband would
really like another beer...

1522
01:24:48,556 --> 01:24:51,557
他已经连续玩那个在线高尔夫5个小时了
...to go with his fifth consecutive hour
of the golf network.

1523
01:24:53,456 --> 01:24:54,980
你好吗?
Are you okay?

1524
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,989
不要担心 亲爱的 爸爸会没事的
Don't worry, honey, Dad's gonna be fine.

1525
01:25:00,619 --> 01:25:02,115
- 你知道她是谁吗?  - 不
GIGl: Do you know who it is?
- No.

1526
01:25:03,371 --> 01:25:05,164
无所谓了
Doesn't matter.

1527
01:25:06,477 --> 01:25:07,887
你要离开他吗?
So are you gonna leave him?

1528
01:25:08,913 --> 01:25:11,847
Gigi 他是我老公
Gigi, he's my husband.

1529
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:15,050
他不是那些不给你回电话的男人
He's not some guy
who didn't call me back.

1530
01:25:15,213 --> 01:25:17,063
他跟我坦白了
He did admit it to me.

1531
01:25:17,418 --> 01:25:20,765
他没有等到被抓到才说 这是需要勇气的 你知道吗?
He didn't wait to get caught,
which takes courage, you know?

1532
01:25:21,676 --> 01:25:23,948
抱歉 我不是那个意思
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

1533
01:25:24,102 --> 01:25:25,319
我不是那个意思
I didn't mean it.

1534
01:25:25,482 --> 01:25:27,812
我知道Alex不是那种人
I know that Alex wasn't just some guy.

1535
01:25:28,167 --> 01:25:30,075
哦 没关系
Oh, it's okay.

1536
01:25:33,959 --> 01:25:35,234
要知道 这是我的错
It's my fault, you know.

1537
01:25:35,723 --> 01:25:36,739
什么?
What?

1538
01:25:36,902 --> 01:25:42,915
哦 我只是想我对这个烂摊子应该...
Oh, I just think I need to take
responsibility for my share in the whole...

1539
01:25:43,078 --> 01:25:45,532
应该负些责任的 你知道吗?
...mess. You know?

1540
01:25:45,705 --> 01:25:48,351
是我逼他结婚的
I forced him into getting married.

1541
01:25:49,224 --> 01:25:51,803
- 他还没准备好  - Janine 这不是你的错
- You know, he wasn't ready.
- Janine, this isn't your fault.

1542
01:25:51,976 --> 01:25:54,872
不 是这样的 我变了
No, it is. It is, I've changed.

1543
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:57,307
我曾经...
I was...

1544
01:25:58,305 --> 01:26:00,347
很风趣 你知道吗?
...fun, you know?

1545
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:02,466
当我们第一次见面时我很风趣
I was fun when we first met.

1546
01:26:02,629 --> 01:26:03,703
你现在也很风趣啊
You're still fun.

1547
01:26:12,132 --> 01:26:13,474
我们不做爱了
We don't have sex anymore.

1548
01:26:18,978 --> 01:26:20,733
很多夫妇都会有冷淡下来的时候
Lots of couples go through lulls.

1549
01:26:20,896 --> 01:26:22,324
不 我是说...
No, I mean...

1550
01:26:24,674 --> 01:26:27,426
我们从来没有做爱
...we never have sex.

1551
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:37,906
实际上 我是说 我能怪他吗?
I mean, realistically,
what do I expect him to do, you know?

1552
01:26:38,079 --> 01:26:40,284
我觉得这真的太...
I don't think that's really...

1553
01:26:41,981 --> 01:26:44,503
上帝啊 这瓷砖太小了
God, this tile is too small.

1554
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:46,526
我得告诉Javier
I have to tell Javier.

1555
01:26:46,967 --> 01:26:50,007
- 什么?  - 这种瓷砖太小了
- What?
- This tile is too small.

1556
01:26:50,295 --> 01:26:53,977
我得走了 别人问的话就说我今天有点私事儿
I gotta go. I have to take a personal day,
if anyone asks.

1557
01:27:02,012 --> 01:27:05,109
嗯 我的第一任丈夫没什么特别的地方
Well, my first husband was unimpressive.

1558
01:27:05,272 --> 01:27:07,957
他跟他的波霸秘书被我捉奸在床
I found him in bed
with his big-breasted secretary...

1559
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:10,220
当我提前从马尔代夫回到家时...
...when I came home early
from the Maldives.

1560
01:27:10,393 --> 01:27:13,174
太没创意了
It was just so unoriginal.

1561
01:27:13,337 --> 01:27:15,600
我都替他丢脸
Made me feel sorry for him.

1562
01:27:15,763 --> 01:27:19,282
我的第二任丈夫就挺有想象力的
My second husband
was a pinch more creative.

1563
01:27:19,445 --> 01:27:21,171
背着我跟我妹妹有一腿...
Cheated on me with my sister...

1564
01:27:21,334 --> 01:27:26,185
让我觉得自己疑心太重 不正常
...but made me believe that I was insane
for being suspicious.

1565
01:27:26,358 --> 01:27:29,676
所以搞外遇至少得动点儿脑筋 耍些手段
So at least some mind games,
some intrigue.

1566
01:27:29,848 --> 01:27:33,320
可我的最后一任丈夫 真是个极品
But my last husband, he was a gem.

1567
01:27:33,492 --> 01:27:36,273
他是个名副其实的遮谎专家
He was a veritable master
at covering his tracks.

1568
01:27:36,436 --> 01:27:41,173
我翻查他的通话记录 截获他的信用卡账单...
I mean, I pored over his phone records,
I intercepted his credit-card bills...

1569
01:27:41,326 --> 01:27:43,340
还在很多场合都跟踪过他...
...I had him followed
on numerous occasions...

1570
01:27:43,503 --> 01:27:46,705
却从未发现过一丁点儿证据
...and never found
a single shred of evidence.

1571
01:27:46,868 --> 01:27:49,170
直到他去世后...
It wasn't until he died...

1572
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:54,319
我才发现他跟他澳洲情妇的一处房产
...that I found out about the property
he owned with his Austrian mistress.

1573
01:27:54,482 --> 01:27:58,989
但是 真正的高手 我不得不说 是我
But the real master, I have to say, is me.

1574
01:27:59,152 --> 01:28:04,588
三任丈夫 数不清的情人 却从未被抓到
Three husbands, countless boyfriends,
I haven't been caught yet.

1575
01:28:04,914 --> 01:28:06,947
噢 上帝啊 噢 上帝啊
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1576
01:28:09,105 --> 01:28:11,972
- 噢 上帝啊 噢 上帝啊 我不能...  - 嘘
- Oh, my God, oh, my God. I can't-
- Shh.

1577
01:28:17,677 --> 01:28:19,336
在那边
It's over there.

1578
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:24,389
噢 天啊
Oh, my God.

1579
01:28:24,552 --> 01:28:26,249
他喜欢我的样本带 不敢相信
He liked the demo. I can't believe it.

1580
01:28:26,412 --> 01:28:27,429
实在难以置信
It's unbelievable.

1581
01:28:27,592 --> 01:28:30,181
你听到了吗? 他说那简直绕梁三日
Did you hear when he said
that it was hauntingly beautiful?

1582
01:28:30,344 --> 01:28:32,252
当然 我在那儿呢 我在...
Yeah, I was there. I was-

1583
01:28:32,425 --> 01:28:34,055
我在那儿呢 宝贝儿
I was there, baby.

1584
01:28:34,572 --> 01:28:36,231
谢谢你
Thank you.

1585
01:29:06,982 --> 01:29:10,875
Dana 我在工作 我正在看这些报表 你得...
Dana, I'm working. I'm still going over
some offering statements. You gotta-

1586
01:29:11,911 --> 01:29:13,790
你得过会儿再来
You gotta come back later.

1587
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:16,475
我不是Dana
It's not Dana.

1588
01:29:19,457 --> 01:29:20,435
那是你的...?
Is that your-?

1589
01:29:21,414 --> 01:29:22,622
- 那是你的...?  - 嘘
- Is that your-?
- Shh.

1590
01:29:23,197 --> 01:29:24,607
你能到壁橱里躲一会儿吗?
Can you get in the closet?

1591
01:29:26,333 --> 01:29:27,828
- 到壁橱里去  - 什么?
- Get in the closet.
- What?

1592
01:29:28,001 --> 01:29:30,369
赶快到壁橱里呆一会儿 就一会儿
Just go in the closet for a second.
Just for a second.

1593
01:29:30,523 --> 01:29:31,510
Ben?

1594
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:37,273
我一直对Dana说要把这破锁修好
I keep telling Dana
to get that damn lock fixed.

1595
01:29:37,858 --> 01:29:40,668
- 你为什么要费事儿锁着门?  - 什么?
Why do you even bother locking it?
- What?

1596
01:29:40,831 --> 01:29:43,132
你为什么要费事儿锁着门?
Why do you bother locking it?

1597
01:29:44,091 --> 01:29:47,063
噢 你要知道不锁门我什么事情也做不了
Oh, you know I can't get any work done
if I don't.

1598
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,786
- 嘿  - 嗨
- Hey.
- Hi.

1599
01:29:57,371 --> 01:29:59,740
- 我能进来吗?  - 能 当然能
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, of course.

1600
01:30:12,023 --> 01:30:13,011
你要干嘛?
What are you doing?

1601
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:15,571
坐下
Sit down.

1602
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:17,297
好的
Okay.

1603
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:30,443
亲爱的?
Hon?

1604
01:30:35,122 --> 01:30:36,139
你要干嘛?
What are you doing?

1605
01:30:36,599 --> 01:30:38,670
我也不知道 我只是想...
I don't know. I just thought...

1606
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:40,396
也许我们能...
...maybe we could-

1607
01:30:42,228 --> 01:30:43,369
- 抱歉  - 你没事儿吧?
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?

1608
01:30:43,541 --> 01:30:45,449
你只要转过来点儿
Maybe if you just go over there.

1609
01:30:45,622 --> 01:30:47,789
我只是努力想...
Just trying to...

1610
01:30:48,566 --> 01:30:50,320
你知道 重拾激情
...you know, re-light the fire.

1611
01:30:50,483 --> 01:30:52,555
噢 亲爱的
Oh, honey.

1612
01:30:52,718 --> 01:30:56,745
你刚没听到我说吗? 我真得弄完这些报表
Didn't you hear what I said before?
I really gotta finish these offerings.

1613
01:30:58,643 --> 01:31:00,197
听着...
Look...

1614
01:31:01,683 --> 01:31:03,850
我真的在努力
...I'm really trying here.

1615
01:31:06,027 --> 01:31:09,028
你想要拯救我们的婚姻吗?
Do you wanna save our marriage?

1616
01:31:13,774 --> 01:31:15,596
当然
Of course.

1617
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:17,668
我也是
Me too.

1618
01:31:40,872 --> 01:31:44,487
Tyrone 四点到六点你来负责 可以的话给酒保帮帮忙
Tyrone, you cover 4 through 6 and pitch in
with the bussers when you can.

1619
01:31:44,650 --> 01:31:46,539
等一下 我是八点到十点当班
Wait a minute. I'm on 8 through 10.

1620
01:31:47,172 --> 01:31:50,020
嘿 我在这儿干了18个月了 一直是八点到十点
Hey, I been working here 18 months,
8 through 10.

1621
01:31:51,209 --> 01:31:53,098
小失误
Minor oversight.

1622
01:31:54,661 --> 01:31:57,442
Luis 那四点到六点你来负责
Luis, you cover 4 through 6, then.

1623
01:31:57,605 --> 01:32:00,922
哥们儿  Luis好像十个月前就辞了
Dude, Luis quit like 10 months ago.

1624
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,029
是啊 他辞职了
Yeah, he quit.

1625
01:32:05,314 --> 01:32:08,133
我们有什么必要开这个会吗?
Is there any reason
we're even having this meeting?

1626
01:32:08,296 --> 01:32:09,408
还真没有
Not really.

1627
01:32:09,571 --> 01:32:11,460
- 没有 我觉得没有  - 好极了 好的 好极了
- No, not for me.
Great. Good. Great.

1628
01:32:11,623 --> 01:32:13,445
散会
Meeting adjourned.

1629
01:32:13,599 --> 01:32:15,296
干活去吧
Back to work.

1630
01:32:19,678 --> 01:32:21,855
Hey, Kelli Ann.

1631
01:32:23,935 --> 01:32:25,498
有我的电话吗?
Did I get any calls?

1632
01:32:25,661 --> 01:32:30,782
自从你11分钟前问过我之后 都没有你的电话
Since you asked me 11 minutes ago, no.
Not a lot of phone traffic.

1633
01:32:35,327 --> 01:32:37,465
- 噢 天啊  - 怎么?
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1634
01:32:38,108 --> 01:32:39,162
她叫什么名字?
What's her name?

1635
01:32:40,955 --> 01:32:42,231
谁啊?
Who?

1636
01:32:42,394 --> 01:32:43,736
那个女孩儿 Alex
The girl, Alex.

1637
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:46,421
没什么女孩儿
There's no girl.

1638
01:32:46,594 --> 01:32:47,965
你可藏不住 伙计
You can't hide it, man.

1639
01:32:48,128 --> 01:32:51,388
我知道什么是魂不守舍 你现在就是
I know strung out
and you are strung out.

1640
01:32:53,210 --> 01:32:55,665
好了 得了吧
Okay, please.

1641
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:57,717
真是不可思议
This is amazing.

1642
01:32:58,234 --> 01:32:59,922
你无法集中精神 对吧?
You can't focus, right?

1643
01:33:00,095 --> 01:33:04,179
每次电话一响就跳起来 每天检查100次电子邮件...
Jumping every time your phone rings,
checking your e-mail 100 times a day...

1644
01:33:04,342 --> 01:33:06,040
恨不得自己能写歌
...wishing you could write songs.

1645
01:33:06,203 --> 01:33:10,671
还有 平时谈话时感觉总想提起她的名字
No, feeling the need to bring up her name
in random conversations.

1646
01:33:11,323 --> 01:33:14,967
感觉都是一样的 现在轮到你了 我的朋友
It's always the same
and it has happened to you, my friend.

1647
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:20,078
糟糕
Shit.

1648
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:23,894
欢迎来到我的世界 混蛋
Welcome to my world, asshole.

1649
01:33:25,975 --> 01:33:27,662
我来关门
Let me get the door.

1650
01:33:31,162 --> 01:33:33,905
你确定我一点儿都不能吸引你?
Sure I can't interest you
in a little beef and broccoli?

1651
01:33:34,068 --> 01:33:35,861
我得把这活儿做完
I gotta finish this stuff.

1652
01:33:36,024 --> 01:33:37,395
好吧
Okay.

1653
01:33:38,833 --> 01:33:41,614

I love you.

1655
01:33:44,625 --> 01:33:46,379
I love you too.

1656
01:33:50,963 --> 01:33:53,168
- 嗯 晚会儿见 再见  - 再见
- Okay. I'll see you later. Okay, bye.
- Bye.

1657
01:34:01,261 --> 01:34:02,824
- 你真让我作呕  - 我没办法
- You make me sick.
- I had no choice.

1658
01:34:02,997 --> 01:34:05,643
- 你们男人那套借口真让我恶心!  - 我还能怎么做?
- You're a disgusting excuse for a man!
- What was I supposed to do?

1659
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:07,916
- 你才是我想要...  - 别碰我!
- You're the one I wanna be-
- Don't touch me!

1660
01:34:08,079 --> 01:34:10,380
你再也别想碰我
You will never touch me again.

1661
01:34:15,347 --> 01:34:17,677
Dino 再次感谢你让我通过电话付费
Dino, thanks again for letting me
pay over the phone.

1662
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:21,733
我向你保证这种延迟缴费的事儿再也不会有了
I assure you this late-payment thing
will never happen again.

1663
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:24,361
是 我正努力让我的生活少点儿戏剧性
Yep, just trying to trim
some of the drama out of my life.

1664
01:34:25,645 --> 01:34:26,691
噢 又一个来电
Oh, that's my other line.

1665
01:34:26,863 --> 01:34:28,004
好的 再见
Okay, bye.

1666
01:34:28,177 --> 01:34:30,114
- 喂?  -  嗨 Gigi?
<i>- Hello?
Hi, Gigi?</i>

1667
01:34:30,286 --> 01:34:31,629
我是Bill
<i>This is Bill.</i>

1668
01:34:31,792 --> 01:34:33,700
- Bill?  - Alex的朋友
<i>- Bill...?
- Alex's friend.</i>

1669
01:34:33,863 --> 01:34:37,794
我们本该见过面的 但是Alex给我说错了日期
<i>We were supposed to meet up
but Alex told me the wrong day.</i>

1670
01:34:38,475 --> 01:34:40,383
Bill 你还真存在啊
Bill, so you do exist.

1671
01:34:40,556 --> 01:34:41,831
我存在啊
<i>I do.</i>

1672
01:34:41,994 --> 01:34:45,887
你愿意的话 我很想请你吃顿晚饭
<i>And I'd love to buy you dinner sometime
if you're still game.</i>

1673
01:34:46,952 --> 01:34:48,160
行啊
Yes.

1674
01:34:48,332 --> 01:34:50,365
当然 为什么不?
Sure, why not?

1675
01:34:57,892 --> 01:34:59,072
Hey.

1676
01:34:59,235 --> 01:35:01,248
来了 我来了 我来了
Coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

1677
01:35:01,411 --> 01:35:03,713
嗨 嗨 亲爱的
Hi. Hi, sweetie.

1678
01:35:04,135 --> 01:35:05,861
你刚才为什么叫我 "亲爱的"?
See, why did you
just call me "sweetie"?

1679
01:35:06,024 --> 01:35:08,987
- 我们之间一直都是这么叫的  - 为什么?
- We always call each other that.
- Why?

1680
01:35:09,159 --> 01:35:12,026
好吧 听着 我有话要说 好不好?
All right, look,
I wanna say something, okay?

1681
01:35:12,199 --> 01:35:14,500
我们总是叫彼此"亲爱的"
We call each other "sweetie"
all the time.

1682
01:35:14,663 --> 01:35:17,310
我们会在聊了几个小时后 睡倒在电话旁
And we fall asleep on the phone
after talking for hours.

1683
01:35:17,473 --> 01:35:20,704
你肩膀动手术后我给你洗头等等
I washed your hair for you after
you had shoulder surgery and everything.

1684
01:35:20,867 --> 01:35:22,171
就好像我们在一起
And it's like we're together.

1685
01:35:22,334 --> 01:35:24,377
- 我知道我一直...  - 不 等一下
- I know that I've been-
- No, hold on a second.

1686
01:35:24,549 --> 01:35:26,304
让我说完
Let me finish.

1687
01:35:26,467 --> 01:35:28,222
我想也许这都是我的错...
I think maybe this is my fault...

1688
01:35:28,385 --> 01:35:31,961
因为我可能没有说清楚我想要的
...because maybe I wasn't clear
about exactly what I want.

1689
01:35:32,134 --> 01:35:34,646
所以让我... 让我说清楚
So let me- Let me be clear.

1690
01:35:34,819 --> 01:35:36,641
我喜欢出去玩
I love hanging out.

1691
01:35:36,957 --> 01:35:40,639
可你又如此吸引我 我只是... 我都想要
But I'm so attracted to you.
I just- I want both.

1692
01:35:40,802 --> 01:35:43,449
我不知道怎么了 也不知道为什么我们没有进展 我不在乎
I don't know what happened
or why we stopped. I don't care.

1693
01:35:43,612 --> 01:35:44,992
好吧
Okay.

1694
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:47,696
- 什么?  - 好吧
- What?
- Okay.

1695
01:35:47,869 --> 01:35:50,937
不是 我是说真这样做 比如确定恋爱关系
No, I'm talking about really doing this.
Like a full-on relationship.

1696
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:52,529
好啊
Right.

1697

With me.

Yeah.

1699
01:35:56,921 --> 01:35:58,714
难道是一群同志把你逼到这份儿上了?
A bunch of gay people
put you up to this?

1700
01:35:58,877 --> 01:36:00,603
别说话了
Stop talking.

1701
01:36:18,812 --> 01:36:21,871

Stay home. It's an end-around.
No, no, it's not. He's still got it.

1702
01:36:22,043 --> 01:36:23,414
他还是进了
He's still got it.

1703
01:36:23,577 --> 01:36:26,061
- 真烂  - 怎么会这样? 真丢人
Shit.
- Who let that happen? It's embarrassing.

1704
01:36:26,234 --> 01:36:29,877
- 哎呦!  - 太丢人了
Argh!
That is so embarrassing.

1705
01:36:30,232 --> 01:36:31,210

to get to the store?

1707
01:36:35,381 --> 01:36:37,491
哦 不去 我们叫了外卖
Oh, yeah, no.
We're good, we got takeout.

All right, here we go.
- Come on, defense, wake up.

1710
01:36:44,692 --> 01:36:47,338
你们是不是在搞笑啊
You have to be kidding me.

1711
01:37:00,082 --> 01:37:03,275
我刚做了一点儿 就很快就做完
I just got a little bit more of this
I gotta finish.

1712

...then I had another load of clothes
in the dryer.

1714

I did get some of the food your dad likes,
but some healthy stuff too.

1715
01:37:12,049 --> 01:37:13,803

Just, you know.

It's gonna be okay.

1717
01:37:21,330 --> 01:37:22,404

It'll be okay.

1718
01:38:28,644 --> 01:38:30,686

Bend your knee a little bit more.
There you go.

...to take the whole marriage thing
off the table completely?

1776

1795
01:43:46,031 --> 01:43:49,157
你刚赢了场大胜仗 亲爱的 来吧
You just won a really big battle,
my friend. Come on.

1796
01:43:50,893 --> 01:43:56,157

So we're not gonna get married,

这样我们都赢了
Mm-hm. And we both win.

1798
01:43:59,398 --> 01:44:02,217

All right. I'll get rid of them if you like.

1799
01:44:02,476 --> 01:44:04,327
这套房子花了你不少钱吧?
You're getting
a lot of bids on this place?

1800
01:44:04,490 --> 01:44:07,587
是啊 我知道这很疯狂 但正好附近有人转手
Yeah. I know it's crazy,
but it's a neighborhood in transition.

1801

We used to have the exact same one...

1810
01:44:36,967 --> 01:44:40,160
只是我老妈把这当桌子

1811
01:44:42,145 --> 01:44:44,034

But I have this one buyer...

1815
01:44:51,868 --> 01:44:55,291

...and I wanted to make sure
his girlfriend likes it first.

1816
01:44:55,837 --> 01:44:58,071

And hopefully, if you like it...

1821
01:45:07,008 --> 01:45:09,492
我们能继续发展的话 你知道的...
...and things continue to, you know...

1822
01:45:11,035 --> 01:45:12,378
Anna...

1823
01:45:12,541 --> 01:45:14,516
我有个计划 你知道吗?
...I have a plan, okay?

1824
01:45:14,689 --> 01:45:17,527
我知道我要走的路 而我想让你陪我走
I know where my life is going,
and I want you to go with me.

1825
01:45:17,690 --> 01:45:19,867
我不是在说让你马上就搬进来...
I'm not saying I want you
to move in right now...

1826
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:23,798
但我不会买这个地方 除非...
...but I don't want to buy this place
unless, at some point...

1827
01:45:23,961 --> 01:45:26,138
你有搬进来的可能性
...you could see yourself moving in.

1828
01:45:26,684 --> 01:45:28,305
那么 你怎么想的呢?
So, what do you think?

1829
01:45:29,820 --> 01:45:31,987
我做不到
I can't do this.

1830
01:45:32,917 --> 01:45:34,480
Okay.

1831
01:45:35,544 --> 01:45:38,392
好吧 如果这样太快了 我猜我们总可以...
Well, if it's too fast,
I guess we can always just-

1832
01:45:38,555 --> 01:45:40,693
我不能答应你任何事
I can't do any of this.

1833
01:45:41,365 --> 01:45:42,640
我意思是...
I mean...

1834
01:45:42,803 --> 01:45:47,060
你所说的 还有你所提供的...
...what you're saying
and what you're offering...

1835
01:45:47,223 --> 01:45:50,158
是每个女孩子梦寐以求的
...is what every girl wants.

1836
01:45:50,330 --> 01:45:52,564
也是我一直想要的
It's what I always wanted.

1837
01:45:52,727 --> 01:45:54,636
只是...
It's just...

1838
01:46:01,137 --> 01:46:02,354
我不是你想要的
You don't want it with me.

1839
01:46:22,357 --> 01:46:23,335
Okay.

1840
01:46:24,754 --> 01:46:26,537
我有个问题
I have a question.

1841
01:46:27,889 --> 01:46:30,095
有没有什么办法 我们可以..
Is there any way we could...

1842
01:46:30,986 --> 01:46:33,892
回到过去 当我们只是睡一起的时候...
...dial it back to before,
when we were just sleeping together...

1843
01:46:34,064 --> 01:46:37,957
因为 我也说不清 我的脑子已经是一团浆糊了
...because I don't know,
I felt like that gelled.

1844
01:46:51,305 --> 01:46:52,801
宝贝儿？
Babe?


1845
01:47:26,055 --> 01:47:27,234
认识你真的很高兴
It was nice meeting you.

1846
01:47:27,397 --> 01:47:29,564
非常感谢你陪我度过一个美好的夜晚
Thank you so much for a lovely evening.

1847
01:47:29,737 --> 01:47:31,453
我也谢谢你
You too.

1848
01:47:37,542 --> 01:47:38,520
晚安
Good night.

1849
01:47:56,796 --> 01:47:58,810
你忘了什么吗?
You forget something?

1850
01:47:59,740 --> 01:48:01,648
是的
Yeah, I did.

1851
01:48:02,434 --> 01:48:04,573
真的吗? 你忘记什么了?
Really? What did you forget?

1852
01:48:08,130 --> 01:48:09,530
这个
This.

1853
01:48:14,171 --> 01:48:18,448
你半夜跑过来 就是为了把一只促销笔还给我吗?
You came all the way here at 11:00 at night
to bring me back a promotional pen?

1854
01:48:18,620 --> 01:48:19,665
没错
Yeah.

1855
01:48:19,838 --> 01:48:24,949
我只是觉得应该找点像样的借口来见你
I thought I should just come up with
some really great excuse to get over here.

1856
01:48:25,112 --> 01:48:27,125
一般不都是这样吗?
That's how it's done, isn't it?

1857
01:48:28,506 --> 01:48:29,782
有时候
Sometimes.

1858
01:48:29,945 --> 01:48:32,399
听着 我忍不住一直想你
Look, I can't stop thinking about you.

1859
01:48:32,859 --> 01:48:34,001
这是个问题
It's a problem.

1860
01:48:34,173 --> 01:48:38,229
我开车到你家 给你电话然后挂掉
I drive by your place, I call and hang up.

1861
01:48:38,392 --> 01:48:39,370
我好像变成了...
I'm turning into-

1862
01:48:39,543 --> 01:48:40,972
我
Me.

1863
01:48:41,883 --> 01:48:43,474
是的
Yeah.

1864
01:48:46,456 --> 01:48:48,691
一个聪明人曾告诉过我...
A wise person once told me...

1865
01:48:48,854 --> 01:48:53,456
如果一个男人喜欢一个女人 不管怎样 他都会把她追到手
...that if a guy wants to be with a girl
he will make it happen, no matter what.

1866
01:48:53,619 --> 01:48:54,674
没错
That's true.

1867
01:48:54,837 --> 01:48:57,742
但当我对你投怀送抱时...
But when I was hurling my body
onto yours...

1868
01:48:57,905 --> 01:48:59,948
你却不想和我在一起
...you did not seem
to want to make it happen.

1869
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:03,313
是的 好吧 事情是这样的:
Yeah, all right.
Here's the thing about that:

1870
01:49:03,476 --> 01:49:04,848
你是对的
You were right.

1871
01:49:05,011 --> 01:49:08,558
我已经习惯了 跟所有的女人保持安全距离...
I've gotten so used to keeping myself
at a safe distance from all these women...

1872
01:49:08,721 --> 01:49:10,035
所以渐渐地...
...and having the power...

1873
01:49:10,198 --> 01:49:12,231
我已经不知道...
...that I didn't know what it felt like...

1874
01:49:12,404 --> 01:49:14,503
爱一个人...
...when I actually fell...

1875
01:49:14,676 --> 01:49:16,747
是什么感觉了
...for one of them.

1876
01:49:19,662 --> 01:49:21,551
我当时不知道
I didn't know.

1877
01:49:30,219 --> 01:49:32,492
听着 我刚和你的朋友Bill约会了...
Look, I just went out
with your friend Bill and...

1878
01:49:32,655 --> 01:49:33,671
是的
Yeah.

1879
01:49:33,844 --> 01:49:36,299
也许他正是我所想要的
He might be just exactly what I need.

1880
01:49:36,462 --> 01:49:38,121
平平淡淡
No drama.

1881
01:49:38,284 --> 01:49:40,489
他给我电话 他没有食言
He calls, he does what he says.

1882
01:49:40,652 --> 01:49:42,694
- 我也能做到啊  - 但你没有
- I can do that stuff too.
- But you didn't.

1883
01:49:42,857 --> 01:49:45,283
那个聪明人还告诉我 我要做自己的主人
And that same wise person told me
that I am the rule.

1884
01:49:45,456 --> 01:49:48,898
我不能指望男人会改变自己
That I have to stop thinking
that every guy will change.

1885
01:49:49,071 --> 01:49:51,238
我不应该再想着...
That I have to stop thinking that-

1886
01:50:07,846 --> 01:50:09,543
我是个特例
I'm the exception.

1887
01:50:12,525 --> 01:50:14,980
你是我的特例
You are my exception.

1888
01:50:56,547 --> 01:50:57,525
Conor Barry.

1889
01:50:57,698 --> 01:51:00,028
嗨 我是Blade公司的Mary
<i>Hi, it's Mary at the Blade.</i>

1890
01:51:00,191 --> 01:51:02,396
我在看你的新广告 我很喜欢它
I'm looking at your new ad and I love it.

1891
01:51:03,297 --> 01:51:05,752
真的吗? 你不觉得T形的肌肉太夸张了吗?
Really? You don't think the muscle T
is too much?

1892
01:51:06,404 --> 01:51:10,010
我觉得你现在穿的衬衫可能更配你
I think the shirt you're wearing now
is probably more you.

1893
01:51:11,841 --> 01:51:13,116
什么 你在这儿?
What, you here?

1894
01:51:13,279 --> 01:51:15,379
我就坐在你前面
I'm sitting right in front of you.

1895
01:51:16,674 --> 01:51:18,496
哇 这就是你啊 Mary
Wow, this is you. Mary.

1896
01:51:18,649 --> 01:51:19,665
是我
It's me.

1897
01:51:19,838 --> 01:51:21,017
我是我
I'm me.

1898
01:51:24,728 --> 01:51:26,013
我能...?
Should I-?

1899
01:51:26,272 --> 01:51:27,547
- 来吧 来吧  - 好的
<i>- Please. Please.
- Okay.</i>

1900
01:51:27,710 --> 01:51:29,647
- 一会再聊  - 待会见
<i>- Talk to you in a minute.
- See you in a second.</i>

1901
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:31,603
好的
Okay.

1902
01:51:33,272 --> 01:51:34,806
Hey.

1903
01:51:34,969 --> 01:51:36,216
- 你好  - 你好吗?
- Hi.
- How are you?

1904
01:51:36,379 --> 01:51:37,721
很高兴终于见到你了
It's nice to finally meet you.

1905
01:51:37,884 --> 01:51:38,900
- 我也是  - 这次是真人
- You too.
- In person.

1906
01:51:39,447 --> 01:51:41,557
这是个愉快的惊喜
This is a pleasant surprise.

1907
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:42,899
- 你...  - 什么?
- You...
- What?

1908
01:51:43,062 --> 01:51:46,063
- 我不知道 不是我预料中的  - 我的声音和我的脸不匹配吗?
- I don't know. Not what I expected.
- My voice doesn't match my face?

1909
01:51:46,236 --> 01:51:48,499
你的声音没能很好地衬出你漂亮的脸蛋
Your voice does not match your face
in a good way.

1910
01:51:48,662 --> 01:51:51,567
而是... 是的 我意思是... 那听起来不好
In a- Yeah, I mean-
That sounded terrible.

1911
01:51:56,026 --> 01:51:57,685
太神奇了
Amazing.

1912
01:51:57,848 --> 01:52:00,082
我不知道这些东西之前是怎么放的
I don't know how all this stuff
fit in here before.

1913
01:52:00,245 --> 01:52:03,026
我知道 这里似乎变宽敞了
I know. It seems like it just expanded.

1914
01:52:11,569 --> 01:52:15,760
你不应该把这个带回来
You are not trying
to get these back in here.

1915
01:52:15,923 --> 01:52:18,742
- 你不会把这些裤子扔掉吧  - 我们有协议的 先生
- You are not getting rid of these pants.
- We had a deal, mister.

1916
01:52:18,895 --> 01:52:20,209
我和它只能留一个
These are not staying.

1917
01:52:20,372 --> 01:52:24,524
- 你可以把它们叠起来放好啊  - 连慈善机构都不会想要这条裤子
- You can store those horizontally.
- Goodwill wouldn't even take these.

1918
01:52:24,687 --> 01:52:27,055
他们可以被熨平的 你可以...
They could be pressed,
flattened, you can-

1919
01:52:27,218 --> 01:52:30,536
如果你要把它们扔出去 至少检查一下口袋 好吗?
If you're gonna throw them out,
at least check the pockets, all right?

1920
01:52:30,708 --> 01:52:34,189
那你就不会扔掉一些私人物品了
So you don't throw away
some personal items.

1921
01:52:50,730 --> 01:52:53,827
我太爱你了
I love you so much.

1922
01:52:54,537 --> 01:52:56,071
太爱太爱了
So much.

1923
01:52:56,656 --> 01:52:58,756
我要你幸福
And I wanna make you happy.

1924
01:52:59,369 --> 01:53:01,229
我一定要让你幸福...
I need to make you happy...

1925
01:53:01,383 --> 01:53:05,477
只要你幸福 我死都愿意
...for me to even have a shot
at being happy.

1926
01:53:06,733 --> 01:53:11,720
你 愿意 嫁给我吗?
Will you marry me?

1927
01:53:17,099 --> 01:53:20,541
愿意 当然愿意
Yes, of course I will. Yes.

1928
01:53:20,714 --> 01:53:22,210
是的
Yes.

1929
01:53:26,630 --> 01:53:28,356
感谢主
Thank God.

1930
01:53:32,134 --> 01:53:34,272
女孩在成长的过程中会学到很多东西:
<i>GIGl:
Girls are taught a lot of stuff growing up:</i>

1931
01:53:34,435 --> 01:53:36,890
如果一个男孩欺负你 是因为他喜欢你
<i>If a guy punches you, he likes you.</i>

1932
01:53:37,063 --> 01:53:39,201
不要打理你的前刘海
<i>Never try to trim your own bangs.</i>

1933
01:53:39,364 --> 01:53:44,120
然后有一天 你会遇到非常棒的男人 从此过着幸福生活
<i>And someday you will meet a wonderful guy
and get your very own happy ending.</i>

1934
01:53:44,293 --> 01:53:45,884
你们互相宣誓
...and your commitment to each other.

1935
01:53:47,399 --> 01:53:50,592
我们看的每场电影 听过的每个故事...
<i>GIGl: Every movie we see,
every story we're told...</i>

1936
01:53:50,755 --> 01:53:52,376
都告诉我们要耐心等待
<i>...implores us to wait for it.</i>

1937
01:53:53,153 --> 01:53:58,752
而第三类情况是:无法预知的爱情宣言
<i>The third act twist:
The unexpected declaration of love.</i>

1938
01:53:59,682 --> 01:54:01,725
游离于规则之外
<i>The exception to the rule.</i>

1939
01:54:01,888 --> 01:54:05,301
但有时我们太专注于寻找幸福...
<i>But sometimes we're so focused
on finding our happy ending...</i>

1940
01:54:05,474 --> 01:54:08,053
而没有学会如何读懂别人的暗示
<i>...we don't learn how to read the signs.</i>

1941
01:54:08,226 --> 01:54:11,036
如何分辨谁是真正爱我们的人
<i>How to tell the ones who want us
from the ones who don't.</i>

1942
01:54:11,199 --> 01:54:14,363
如何分辨这个人是不是只是生命中的过客
<i>The ones who will stay
from the ones who will leave.</i>

1943
01:54:22,590 --> 01:54:24,374
- Hi.
- Hi.

1944
01:54:24,891 --> 01:54:29,082
或许这个幸福的结局中并没有一个很棒的男人
<i>GIGl: And maybe this happy ending
doesn't include a wonderful guy.</i>

1945
01:54:30,366 --> 01:54:33,234
或许是你...
<i>Maybe it's you...</i>

1946
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:36,542
你一个人...
<i>...on your own...</i>

1947
01:54:36,695 --> 01:54:39,629
收拾好心情 然后重新开始
<i>...picking up the pieces and starting over.</i>

1948
01:54:40,924 --> 01:54:44,721
释放自己 为了更好的未来
<i>Freeing yourself up
for something better in the future.</i>

1949
01:54:46,428 --> 01:54:49,237
或许这个幸福的结局只是...
<i>Maybe the happy ending is just...</i>

1950
01:54:49,784 --> 01:54:51,644
继续生活
<i>...moving on.</i>

1951
01:54:55,288 --> 01:54:58,586
Baby 你在做什么啊? 轮到我们了 别在搅这个了 来吧 来吧
Baby, what are you doing? It's our turn.
Forget the dip. Come on, come on.

1952
01:54:58,740 --> 01:55:00,715
我们开始吧 Alex
Let's go, Alex.

but why not? You know, why not?</i>

1969
01:55:52,369 --> 01:55:53,645
迟做总比不做好

<i>...is like a self-discovery,
as opposed to dating.</i>

1983
01:56:28,327 --> 01:56:30,657
我不知道 或许我现在还不适合约会

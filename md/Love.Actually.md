	你爱他吗?
	Do you love him?{\r}
	 what?
	
	 I just thought I'd ask the blunt question in case it was the right one and you needed someone to talk to about it.
	
	 so you'd never been able to talk about it even though you might have wanted to.
	
	 no. No is the answer. Absolutely not.
	
	 that's a no then? Yes.
	
	嗯
	Um...{\r}
	 what do you reckon? The worst in history?
	
	大概吧 要看他下一首放什么歌

	这歌是献给有情人的
	Now here's one for the lovers.{\r}
	现场一定有很多对热恋情侣
	That's quite a few of you. I shouldn't be surprised and a half.{\r}

	Thought as much. Do you think everybody knows?{\r}
	- 知道 - 卡尔知道吗？- 知道
	- Yes. - Do you think karl knows? - Yes.{\r}
	 that is... that is bad news.
	
	 I just thought that maybe the time had come to do something about it.
	
	
	
	跟他说你想跟他结婚生宝宝
	casually drop into the conversation the fact that you'd like to marry him and have lots of sex and babies.{\r}
	- 你知道我想？- 对

	这是摇滚传奇麦比利的圣诞歌
	And that was the Christmas effort by the once-great Billy Mack.{\r}
	 how are the mighty fallen.
	
	我敢拍胸脯打包票 这是本世纪最烂的曲
	I could safely put my hand up my arse and say that is the worst record I've heard this century.{\r}
	 I believe Billy will be...
	
	是本台另一位DJ的来宾
	a guest on my friend Mike's show in a few minutes'time.{\r}
	 Bill.

	 Mike.
	
	圣诞节要跟你爱的人一起过
	Christmas is a time for people with someone they love in their lives.{\r}
	 Michael.
	
	 I was greedy and foolish.
	
	 wrinkled and alone.
	
	 Bill.
	
	 for actually giving a real answer to a question.
	
	 I can tell you.
	
	 best shag you ever had?
	
	- 小甜甜布兰妮 - 哇
	- Britney Spears. - Wow.{\r}
	 only kidding. She was rubbish.
	
	 here's one. How do you think...
	
	你的新歌比得上经典老歌吗
	the new record compares to your old classic stuff?{\r}
	 Mikey. You know as well as I do the record's crap.
	
	
	
	而是一个想咸鱼翻身的老歌星

	And particularly enjoy the incredible crassness of the moment...{\r}
	在第四句歌词多塞了一个音节
	when we try to squeeze an extra syllable into the fourth line.{\r}
	我猜你说的是 # 如果你爱圣诞节 #
	I think you're referring to... # lf you really love Christmas #{\r}
	祈祷天公下大雪
	"Come on and let it snow." ouch!{\r}

	党内同志强烈认为
	Alex? There's a very strong feeling in the party...{\r}
	不能像上任首相那样 被牵着鼻子走
	we mustn't allow ourselves to be bullied from pillar to post like the last government.{\r}
	这是首次重大的考验 态度必须强硬

	你是个医生？ 还不是，希望就快是了
	- You're a doctor? - Not yet. Fingers crossed.
	棒呆了，好样的
	Awesome. That's awesome for you.
	嗨，伊莱
	- Hey, Eli. - Hey.
	我们很赶，很高兴见到你
	Well, we're kind of in a rush, so it was good seeing you.
	幸会了
	- Nice to meet you. - Nice meeting you.
	你今天很美
	You look beautiful today.
	幸会了
	Nice meeting you.
	你这五八蛋
	You piece of shit.
	怎么了？ 什么怎么了？我问你
	- What? - ''What?'' Let me ask you.
	你是不是跟艾玛上了床？
	Did you have sex with Emma?
	没有
	No.
	你有没有跟艾玛炒饭？
	Did you have sex with Emma?
	有
	Yes.
	可是我不该告诉任何人
	- l'm not supposed to tell anyone. - Yes! Wow!
	我打给她，她没回电 只传了简讯
	l called her, but she didn't call me back. She sent me a text.
	她写什么？ “嗨”
	- All right. Well, what'd she text you? - ''Hi.''
	只有“嗨”？没别的？
	- Just ''Hi''? - ''Hi.'' With nothing else? Just ''H-i''?
	我该怎么回应？
	l don't know. What do l do with that? l don't know.
	情况不妙
	That's not good.
	你得赶快抽身，结束了
	You just gotta walk away, pal. lt's over.
	她对你没兴趣 真的吗？
	- She's not into it. - Shit. Seriously?
	很高兴见到你们 回头见
	- Good seeing you guys. - See you later.
	你真以为她是利用他的车？
	You really think she's just using him for his car?
	才怪，他想在油电车里上她
	No, Adam, l don't. l think he wants to fuck her in his Prius.
	因为在油电车里面做爱超环保的
	And the thing about fucking in a Prius is that you don't have to feel guilty afterwards.
	因为可以节能减碳
	- 'Cause of the carbon footprint. - Yeah.
	梅医师前几天跟我说话 不是吧，他说什么？
	- Metzner talked to me the other day. - Shut up. What did he say?
	“你做错了”，超棒的
	He was like, ''No, you're doing that wrong.'' lt was amazing.
	艾玛
	Emma.
	你跑来干嘛？
	What are you doing here?
	你没回电，我就自己跑来
	Hi. You didn't call me back, so l thought l'd come here.
	送你的
	lt's for you.
	恭喜？恭喜什么？跟你炒饭？
	''Congrats''? For what? Having sex with you?
	对，你干得很好 我觉得应该送你气球
	Yeah. You did a good job, so... l thought you deserved a balloon.
	我在工作耶 好吧
	- l'm working. - OK.
	你干嘛不回我电话？
	So, what's up with not calling me back?
	我不太会这种事 什么事？聊天？
	- l'm not good at this stuff. - At what, talking?
	对，聊天，沟通 谈恋爱之类的
	Yeah, talking. Communicating. Relationship stuff.
	是这样的
	lt's just... This is...
	要是我们谈恋爱
	lf we were in a relationship,
	我就会变得很古怪很可怕
	l'd become a weird, scary version of myself, and...
	我的喉咙会缩紧跳动
	My throat starts constricting, the walls start throbbing.
	就像花生酱过敏症 感情的花生酱过敏症
	lt's like a peanut allergy, like... an emotional peanut allergy.
	我也不能跟你交往 你不是我爸的菜
	Well, l can't date you, either. 'Cause you're not my dad's type, so...
	艾玛，巡房 嗨，亚当
	Emma, rounds. Hey, Adam.
	我该走了
	- What's up? - Look, l should probably go.
	谢谢你，我们只是朋友
	Thank you. We'll be friends, right?
	对，普通朋友
	Yeah, friends.
	我们的身高差太多
	With the height difference?
	他站在我旁边好像要绑架我
	We stand next to each other, it looks like he's kidnapping me.
	干嘛？ 你老是这样
	- What? - You always do this.
	故意挑喜欢你的男生的毛病
	You always find something wrong with everybody who likes you.
	我交往过的男生才真正有毛病
	And l date guys who have real problems.
	有一个偷走我的信用卡
	l date guys who steal my credit card,
	然后怪我没把信用卡收好
	and then they tell me it's my fault because l left it out.
	你却找到完美的男生
	You find these perfect guys,
	然后说:行不通，他太快乐了
	and then you're like, ''lt'll never work, he's too happy.''
	怎样，梅医师？
	What's up, Dr. Metzner?
	我跟梅大医师说“怎样”？
	Did l just say ''What's up'' to Stephen Metzner?
	真是惨不忍睹
	That was really hard to watch.
	我知道我应该想要谈恋爱
	Look, l know l'm supposed to want to be in a relationship.
	不过到头来我只会心碎 留下一堆他的旧T恤
	But l'd just end up with a broken heart and a bunch of his old T-shirts.
	逻辑上来说… 你在干嘛？
	- Just from a purely logical aspect... - What are you doing?
	传简讯给他 当然了
	- l'm texting him. - Of course you are.
	你有女生问题，我很同情你
	
	我有99个问题，不包括女生
	
	你不该送她气球
	You know, you shouldn't have gotten her a balloon actually.
	你是“天外奇迹”的老头吗？
	Who do you think you are, the old guy from Up?
	你叫我送她气球
	You told me to get her a balloon.
	我没想到你真的会送，逊毙了
	Well, l didn't think you'd actually do it. lt's a terrible idea.
	没人知道这件事，别说出去 不会啦
	Listen. Hey, nobody knows about this, - so don't say anything to anyone. OK? - All right, l won't.
	艾玛传的简讯 上面写什么？
	- lt's from Emma. - What's it say?
	“你在哪里？” 你写什么？
	- ''Where are you?'' - What are you writing?
	“嗨，你好”和一个眯眼
	''Hi, how are you doing?'' and then a winky face.
	亚当，过了晚上10点了
	No, Adam, it's after 10pm.
	“你在哪里？”的意思是:
	Come on, the ''Where are you?'' text is like saying:
	我想炒饭
	''Hey, l want to have sex with you,
	但是我得知道你有多醉
	but l just need to know how drunk you are.''
	你上了艾玛然后送她气球？
	Did you fuck Emma and then bring her a balloon?
	什么？你告诉他？
	What? Did you tell him?
	没！有！
	No! Yes!
	你不能告诉任何人 她传简讯给他: “你在哪里？”
	- You can't tell anyone. - She just texted him, ''Where are you?''
	她想要炒饭
	Oh, she wants the dick.
	亚当，你得Man一点 一定要有威严
	Adam, you want to come back strong here. Go from a position of power.
	回传说: “我在哪里？我在你“那里””
	Something like, ''Where am l? Why don't you check your underpants.''
	对，别这样写
	- Yeah. Don't write that. - Yeah!
	我才不会咧 我喜欢吓人
	- l would never write that. - See, l like to be kind of scary.
	像是“砰，我的老二来了”
	Like, ''Boo! Here comes my dick.''
	你和女生炒完饭送她气球？
	Did you have sex with some girl and give her a balloon?
	你能不能不要告诉每个人呀？
	Can we not tell everyone?
	我道歉
	l apologize.
	你回传什么？
	So, what'd you write back?
	“嗨”
	''Hi.''
	这样还行 不错，很好
	- Yeah, that could work. - Yeah, it's not bad. ''Hi'' is fine.
	(你家半小时后)
	
	你做了很多有趣的动作
	There were so many interesting things going on.
	翻转的动作，那算什么？
	- Yeah. - That flippy thing, what was that?
	不知道，我突然想到就做了
	Sure, l just, l don't know, l had an idea, l just went with it.
	那真的很棒 谢谢你
	- That was a really good call. - Thank you.
	我们最好不要抱抱
	We probably shouldn't snuggle.
	好，感觉不对劲
	Yeah. That just felt wrong.
	我该走了
	l should head out.
	这么快？ 是啊
	- Already? - Yeah.
	你想吃松糕吗？
	You want to grab a muffin or something?
	不行，我得工作
	l can't. l have to go to work.
	我不想吓到你，不过…
	OK. You know, l don't want to freak you out, but...
	改天我想跟你在白天约会
	...l'd love to hang out with you in the daytime sometime.
	不可能，我没时间
	lt's not really possible. l have no time.
	我每周工作80小时 轮班36小时
	l work 80 hours a week, doing 26-hour shifts.
	我需要的是半夜两点跟我上床
	What l need is someone who's gonna be in my bed at 2am,
	不会说谎 也不必跟他吃早餐的男人
	who l don't have to lie to or eat breakfast with.
	我超讨厌吃早餐，还有说谎
	l hate breakfast. And lying.
	我也讨厌战争
	l also hate war.
	你想这样吗？
	Do you want to do this?
	怎么样？
	Do what?
	利用对方做爱做的事 24小时随时待命
	Use each other for sex, at all hours of the day and night.
	其它的什么都不做
	Nothing else.
	行，我可以 很好
	- Yeah, l could do that. - Good.
	这一定会很好玩
	lt's gonna be fun.
	这一定行不通 为什么？
	- You know this is never gonna work. - Why not?
	因为你会爱上我
	Because clearly you're gonna fall in love with me.
	是吗？ 那就等到
	Oh, really? Well, then we just do this
	其中一个动了感情 然后就停下来
	until one of us feels something more, and then we stop.
	不会是我 也不会是我
	- Well, it won't be me. - lt won't be me.
	祝你好运
	Good luck with that.
	我们是炮友
	We're sex friends.
	我们只是饭饭之交
	Just friends who have sex.
	这是不可能的
	That's not possible.
	我要发剧本…要花一个小时
	l'm going to distribute these for an hour or so.
	我们应该保持简单
	Listen, we should keep this simple.
	也许应该建立基本规则
	l mean, maybe we should establish some ground rules.
	基本规则，好主意
	Ground rules. Good idea.
	可以先从不吵架开始
	OK, well, we can start with no fighting.
	不说谎 都很好
	- No lying. - Those are good ones.
	不吃醋，直视对方的眼睛
	No jealousy, no staring deeply into each other's eyes.
	别把我列为紧急联络人 反正我人会到
	Don't list me as your emergency contact. l won't come.
	这不是违反医生职业道德吗？
	lsn't that against your Hippocratic oath?
	我不会让你死 是吗？
	- l'd let you die. - Oh, yeah?
	我一小时后回来
	l'll be back in like... an hour.
	玩得开心
	Have fun.
	我只是去买优格
	l'm just getting some yogurt.
	天啊，我败犬到想骂人
	God, l am single as fuck.
	天啊，它好像直直往我凸过来
	Oh, my God. lt looks like it's coming right at me.
	还有，别说我的老二很可爱
	Hey, one more thing. Don't call my penis cute.
	就算它扮成小熊温柔地看着你
	Even if it's dressed up like a Care Bear, and it's giving you a Care Stare.
	别打扮你的老二，千万不要
	Don't dress up your penis. Ever.
	你的保险给付侵入性手术吗？
	Does your insurance cover invasive procedures?
	这游戏有点太可怕了
	OK. OK, this is getting a little too realistic.
	相信我
	Trust me.
	有人到处在嘿咻 害我不能专心看A片！
	l can't focus on my porn with all this real sex going on around me!
	你在干嘛？
	What are you doing?!
	我寄了交友邀请，你会接受吗？
	l just friended you. Do you think you're gonna confirm or ignore?
	我一定不会接受
	Oh, l'm gonna confirm. For sure.
	你这么漂亮，当然会啰
	Yeah, look at you. Of course.
	需要帮忙吗？
	Anytime. Need some help?

	Oh, beautiful! Beautiful!
	(他的手真的很小)
	
	那算什么？ 什么？
	- What was that? - What?
	你在吃醋吗？ 那家伙？拜托
	- Are you being jealous? - Of that guy? Come on.
	就算我喜欢他，我们也会变
	Look, even if l did like him, it doesn't change what we're doing.
	喔，所以你不喜欢他啰 亚当，我是你女友
	- Ah, so you like him. - Adam, l'm not yours.
	当然了，我怎么会这么想？
	No, of course not. Why would l think that?
	哇，油电车耶，水哦
	Wow. Prius. Nice.
	有点娘，不过很赞 你开什么车？
	- lt's kind of girly, but nice, huh? - What do you drive?
	老旧的BMW，5系列，那里
	Just an old BMW. Five series. Right there.
	是喔，我不是自己买的
	Oh, yeah, sure. l actually paid for mine.

	我在哈佛大学是划船队 哈佛大学！
	- l rowed crew at Harvard. - Oh, Harvard.
	你算是头儿？是不是这样叫？
	What were you, a cocksman? What do they say?
	我是船长
	- What do they call it? - Coxswain.
	我很了，你跟艾玛上床
	No. You know, l get it, right? That you're sleeping with Emma?
	什么？
	l what?
	你和艾玛炒饭，我了了
	That you and Emma have sex sometimes. l get it.
	她累了就打给你 你开车过来炒饭…我猜10分钟
	She's tired, she calls you up, you drive over, and have sex for, l'm guessing, ten minutes.
	你觉得会持久吗？
	Think that's gonna last?
	我不知道你在说什么
	l don't know what you're talking about.
	才怪，现在是没问题啦
	Sure you do. And that's fine, for now.
	不过我才会每天陪在她身边
	But you should just know that l'm gonna be there right next to her every day,
	当个医生…救人济世
	using big words... ...saving people's lives.
	当她厌倦了你就会奔到
	Then, when she's done having her fun with you, she's gonna
	我怀里 因为我是大人，有真正的工作
	come running to me, because l'm a grownup, and l have a real job.
	我真的能照顾她，了吗？
	l can actually take care of her, you know?
	我是她要嫁的男人
	l'm the guy she marries, Adam.
	你只能跟她在残障厕所炒饭
	You're the guy she fucked a couple of times in the handicapped bathroom.
	这是什么？ 我的脚呀，亚当
	- What's this? - These are my feet, Adam.
	超难看的 不，这个啦
	- They're fantastic. - No, this.
	那是你的剧本
	That's your script.
	你爸要我拿给你
	Your dad told me to give it to you.
	他看了，写了些意见
	Yeah, he read it, and he gave you notes, and...
	我会说艾文跟我嗑了魔菇
	l'm not saying Alvin and l did mushrooms together,
	但我也不会说有
	but l'm not prepared to say that we didn't.
	我知道你们父子之间没问题
	l know that you have issues with your dad, and that's cool,
	但他真的喜欢你，他也喜欢我
	but he really likes you and he definitely likes me,
	我们在脑力激荡，随便瞎掰
	and we were just jamming ideas and goofing around
	嗑药嗑到超high的
	and tripping our balls off.
	我要你跳得更悍一点
	Hey. So... l really feel like it needs to be more ghetto.
	就像狂客舞
	You know, like, more crunk? Can you work it out? Thanks.
	跳得不错

	你想给我看没问题
	so if you wanted to give it to me, that's cool.
	真的吗？ 真的

	- Oh, crap. - Katie, who's Bones?
	他是妈的朋友
	He's Mom's friend.

	她有了男朋友？他叫骨头？
	She has a boyfriend? Named Bones?
	他不是游民吗？ 是啦！
	- What is he, a drifter? - No.
	她为什么不告诉我？
	Why didn't she tell me?
	艾玛
	Well, Emma...
	你习惯一个人，我和妈像你

	我的老天爷！

	我知道你很难受 但我是你的前女友不代表…
	l know this might be hard, but just because l'm your ex-girlfriend
	你不能把我当成…妈妈
	doesn't mean that you can't look at me as a kind of... mum?
	天啊 尤其是我们在讨论
	- Oh, boy. - Especially because, well,
	想要一起创造新生命
	Alvin and l have been talking about creating new life together.
	我们去参加烧人节
	You see, we were at Burning Man.
	我们都精心打扮 我穿了火鸟装

	他用沙子把我赤裸裸地埋起来
	and he was burying my bare body in the sand.
	对，用我的火鸟啄插她
	Yeah. Pecking at it with my... fire beak.
	然后我就想
	And then l just thought,
	要是这些沙子…
	you know, what if all these grains of sand,
	都是真的宝宝呢？
	were actually babies?
	于是我们… 我们有了很棒的点子
	- And so we... - We had this wonderful idea.
	我们希望你能祝福我们
	And we... well, we'd like your blessing, Adam.
	你觉得我们一起生小孩怎样？
	How do you feel about the two of us having a baby together?

	我只是有时候和你儿子炒饭
	l just have sex with your son sometimes.
	对，没错
	- But... - Yes, she does.
	但是… 你们没资格把小孩带入这世界
	But... there is really no reason for you to bring a child into this world,
	因为你们自己就像小孩
	since you're acting like children already.
	你说话很毒耶
	- That was really mean. - Yeah.
	我说话是很毒，但你是疯子
	l'm mean. But you're fucking crazy.
	如果要我选择亚当或他爸
	'Cause given the choice between Adam and his dad,
	要我选择亚当或任何人
	given the choice between Adam and anyone, really,
	我一定会选择亚当
	l'd choose Adam, every time.
	你要走了吗？ 好
	- Do you want to get out of here? - Yep.
	对了
	Fuck this.

	- Yeah. l stuck it in. - Wow.
	这一洞有点难度
	Well, this hole's a little bit more complicated.

	You're gonna have to bank it off there. lt's all about the geometry.
	我是个医生
	l'm a doctor.
	又是一杆进洞！
	That hole is my bitch!
	我没有自己的奶昔？
	l don't get my own milkshake?

	我们说好 我们一边散步
	The deal is that we're gonna walk around,
	一边看灯光
	and we're gonna look at the twinkly lights, and then...
	你干嘛要搞砸一切？
	Why are you messing everything up?
	一般人都这么做
	That's what people do, Emma.

	Yeah, yeah, but no, l read it and l was like,
	“我要到他家当面告诉他”
	''God, l want to, like, drive over there and tell him in person.''
	于是我就来了
	So l did. l got in my car, and here l am.
	我真的说出来，听起来是很疯狂
	You know, it's just... l know, it sounds crazy, 'cause now that l'm saying it out loud, it does sound crazy.
	并不疯狂，谢谢你看剧本
	lt's not crazy. l mean, thank you for reading it.
	我寄给了梅根
	No, no, no. l e-mailed it to Megan, and...

	等着看她会怎么说
	- And we'll see what she says. - Wow.
	我说她不喜欢就是疯子
	Yeah, l told her she'd be crazy to not like it.
	但她本来就是疯子，谁晓得？
	But then again, she is a functioning psychotic, so it's like, who knows?
	这一季结束前多出一集
	But there is this extra episode right before the break.
	他们要另请编剧…
	And they are gonna hire a freelancer, so...

	你想不想…？ 什么？
	- Hey, do you wanna...? - What?
	你想怎样？
	Yeah, sorry. What were you gonna...?
	待久一点
	Just to hang out.
	太疯狂了，我在猜你想说什么
	Oh. That's crazy. l was like, ''What's he gonna say?''
	结果你这么说，跟我猜的不一样
	and then you said that. lt's not what l thought you were gonna say.
	那里有张椅子
	That is a chair.

	And don't take this the wrong way,
	因为我永远是你朋友
	because you know l'll be your friend, no matter what.
	但是你最近都超沮丧的
	lt's just, you've been kind of depressing to be around lately,

	你不听也罢，但是…
	so you can take this with a grain of salt, but...
	我们不能选择我们爱上的人

	拍好就给选片的人看
	Then they show that one show to the people who pick shows   {\r}
	根据样片决定哪个可以继续拍下去
	and on the strength of that one show they decide if they want to make more shows {\r}
	被选中的就成为电视节目

	怎么说?
	What do you mean?{\r}
	傻逼才敢替马瑟勒斯·华莱士的老婆做脚部按摩
	You don't be giving Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage {\r}
	是马瑟勒斯太小题大作了吧?
	You don't think he overreacted?{\r}
	
	
	但应该知道他肯定会有所反应
	but he had to expect a reaction{\r}
	只是脚部按摩 这能有什么？
	It was a foot massage  A foot massage is nothing{\r}
	我都会替我老妈做脚部按摩
	I give my mother a foot massage{\r}
	
	
	
	
	不过他妈的性质也差不多了
	but it's the same fucking ballpark{\r}
	 stop right there 
	
	口交和脚部按摩太他妈不同了
	Eating a bitch out and giving a bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fucking thing {\r}
	是不同… 不过也差不多了
	It's not It's the same ballpark {\r}

	不是他妈的相同的性质 是他妈完全不同的两码事！
	ain't the same fucking ballpark It ain't the same league It ain't even the same fucking sport{\r}

	我不给男人做脚部按摩不代表马瑟勒斯是对的 
	Just 'cause I wouldn't give no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus{\r}
	把安特万从楼上仍进该死的玻璃花房摔成结巴太他妈过份了

	我没说他是对的 
	I ain't saying it's right {\r}
	但是你说脚部按摩根本没什么 这我不同意
	But you're saying a foot massage don't mean nothing and I'm saying it does {\r}
	我替很多女人做过脚部按摩 都“有什么”！
	I've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant something {\r}
	 but they do  That's what's so fucking cool about 'em 
	
	 you know you don't talk about it
	
	 and she knows it 
	
	马瑟勒斯很清楚 安特万更他妈清楚
	Fucking Marsellus knew it and Antwan should've fucking better known better {\r}
	 man  This ain't a man with a sense of humor about this shit

	他从窗台摔下去了
	He fell out of a window {\r}
	 that is one way to say it  Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out 
	
	这种说法还说是马瑟勒斯干的 
	Another way would be was he was thrown out by Marsellus{\r}
	甚至说马瑟勒斯把他扔下窗台是因为你
	and yet even another way is to say he was thrown of a window by Marsellus because of you {\r}
	真的吗?
	Is that a fact?{\r}
	 no  It's not a fact  It's just what I heard 
	
	听谁说的?

	你听说马瑟勒斯把“恐怖东尼”从四楼窗台扔下去
	You heard Marsellus threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a four-story window{\r}
	就因为他给我做了脚部按摩？
	for giving me a foot massage?{\r}
	对  那你相信吗?
	Mm-hmm  And you believe that?{\r}
	 it sounded reasonable 
	
	马瑟勒斯把东尼从四楼窗台扔下去
	Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four-story window {\r}
	就因为他按摩了我的脚 这合理吗?
	for massaging my feet seemed reasonable?{\r}
	 I understand
	
	 very protective of you 
	
	丈夫爱护老婆是一件事
	A husband being protective of his wife is one thing {\r}
	老婆被人碰了脚就要杀人是另一回事
	A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else {\r}
	不是这样吗?
	But did it happen?{\r}
	安特万唯一一次碰我 是握我的手…在我的婚礼上
	Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it…at my wedding {\r}
	真的?

	一起被关在越南五年
	We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together over five years {\r}
	好在你绝不会再去经历这一切
	Hopefully you'll never have to experience this yourself {\r}
	当两个人同甘共苦像我和你爸这么久时

	那就必然会承担起另一个人所肩负的责任
	you take on certain responsibilities of the other {\r}
	如果是我没能回来…

	今天一定是库利奇少校在对我儿子说这番话   吉姆

	布奇…
	Butch {\r}
	我要给你一样东西
	I got somethin' for you {\r}
	我给你的这块表是你曾祖父在第一次世界大战时买的

	Made by the first company to ever make wristwatches {\r}
	 people just carried pocket watches 
	
	二等步兵厄瑞纳·库利奇从海上出发去巴黎那天买的
	It was bought by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge on the day he set sail for Paris {\r}
	这就成为那次战争中他不曾离手的战表
	This was your great- grandfather's war watch and he wore it every day he was in that war {\r}
	服完役  他带着这表回老家找你曾祖母
	And when he'd done his duty he went home to your great-grandmother took the watch off   {\r}
	 Dane Coolidge   
	
	又应征入伍 远赴海外再次同德国人作战
	was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the Germans once again {\r}
	这次是第二次世界大战
	This time they called it World War II {\r}
	你曾祖父把表交给你祖父当作吉祥物
	Your great-grandfather gave this watch to your granddad for good luck {\r}
	 Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's
	
	 and he was killed along with all the other marines at the Battle of Wake Island
	
	你祖父知道自己面临死亡
	Your granddad was facing death  He knew it {\r}
	所有的陆战小伙们对活着离开那岛都不存任何幻想
	None of those boys had any illusions about ever leaving that island alive {\r}
	 three days before the Japanese took the island your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport
	
	一个叫维努奇的陌生人
	name of Winocki a man he had never met before in his life{\r}
	把金表带给他还未曾谋面 刚刚出生的幼子
	to deliver to his infant son who he had never seen in the flesh his gold watch {\r}
	 your granddad was dead but Winocki kept his word 
	
	战后他去拜访你祖母
	After the war was over he paid a visit to your gr andmother{\r}
	给你襁褓中的父亲送去他父亲的金表
	delivering to your infant father his dad's gold watch {\r}

	This watch {\r}
	你父亲在河内上空被击落时 就带着它
	This watch was on your daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi {\r}
	 put in a Vietnamese prison camp 
	
	他知道这支表如果被越南猪发现了会被抢走充公
	He knew that if the gooks ever saw the watch they'd confiscate it take it away {\r}
	 this watch was your birthright 
	
	 so he hid it 
	
	有个地方最保险 就是他的屁眼
	in one place he knew he could hide somethin'    his ass {\r}
	五年来他的屁眼一直塞着这玩意

	看来情况就是这样
	that seems to be the situation.{\r}
	
	
	你也不想这样
	and you don't want that{\r}
	这位林戈也肯定不想这样
	and Ringo here definitely doesn't want that {\r}
	所以让我们看看能做些什么
	So let's see what we can do{\r}
	here's the situation 
	
	通常你们两个会像炸鸡一样被我宰掉
	Normally both your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken{\r}
	不过恰好我正想改过自新

	我不想杀你  我想帮你
	and I don't want to kill you  I want to help you {\r}
	 'cause it don't belong to me
	
	 I been through too much shit over this case to just hand it over to your dumb ass

	跟她说你很骄傲
	Tell her you're proud of her {\r}
	 Honey Bunny

	 Honey Bunny 
	
	现在把我的钱包找出来

	上面写"混帐东西"那个
	It's the one that says Bad Motherfucker {\r}

	500 
	
	 put it in your pocket  It's yours 
	
	加上其他人的钱  收获算丰富了
	With the rest of those wallets and the register that makes this a pretty successful little score{\r}
	500 and I'll shoot him on general principle 
	
	 shut the fuck up!
	
	 Vincent 
	
	我不是给他  我是向他买东西

	Your life  I'm givin' you that money so I don't have to kill your ass {\r}
	 Ringo?
	
	 no 
	
	 there's this passage I got memorized 
	
	《以西结书》二十五章十七节
	Ezekiel 25:17 {\r}
	正直之人的道路
	The path of the righteous man{\r}
	被小人的自私贪婪和恶人的暴虐专政所笼罩
	is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men{\r}
	以仁慈善良之名引领弱小穿越黑暗之谷的“牧羊人”
	Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will {\r}
	必将得到神的护佑
	shepherds the weak through the Valley of Darkness{\r}
	因为他守护兄弟同胞、拯救迷途羔羊
	for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children {\r}
	我将对那些毒害和屠杀我同胞的人
	And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger {\r}
	充满巨大的仇恨和爆裂的怒火
	those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers {\r}
	当我复仇之焰吞噬你的那刻 你会知道我的名字 叫做上帝
	And you will know I am the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon you {\r}
	 that meant your ass 
	
	我从未仔细想过其中的涵意
	I never gave much thought to what it meant{\r}
	只觉得是干掉某个混蛋前冷血的说辞
	I just thought it was some cold-blooded shit to say to a motherfucker before I popped a cap in his ass{\r}
	但今早发生了一件事  让我开始反省
	But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice {\r}
	 now I'm thinkin' maybe it means you're the evil man and I'm the righteous man 
	
	我的9毫米口径手枪像牧羊人般保护我穿越黑暗之谷
	and Mr  Nine-millimeter here he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the Valley of Darkness {\r}
	或者你是正直之人 我是“牧羊人”
	Or it could mean you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd {\r}
	而邪恶自私的是这个世界
	and it's the world that's evil and selfish {\r}
	 I'd like that  But that shit ain't the truth 
	
	事实是你是弱者  而我是那暴虐的恶魔
	The truth is you're the weak and I am the tyranny of evil men {\r}
	 Ringo
	
	我真的非常努力想成为慈悲的“牧羊人”
	I'm tryin' real hard to be the shepherd{\r}
	走吧
	Go on {\r}
	我们最好赶快走人
	I think we should be leaving now {\r}
	 that's probably a good idea

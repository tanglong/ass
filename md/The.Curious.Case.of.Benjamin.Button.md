	出门打出租车\N

	出租车司机送完了上一位客人\N
	Now, a taxi driver had dropped off a fare earlier,
	停车去买咖啡\N
	and had stopped to get a cup of coffee.
	与此同时 Daisy还在排练\N
	And all the while, Daisy was rehearsing.
	那位刚送完了客人\N
	And this cab driver, who dropped off the earlier fare
	停车去买咖啡的司机\N
	and had stopped to get the cup of coffee,
	恰好接到了要去购物的女子\N
	he picked up the lady who was going shopping
	正因如此 那位女子错过了上一辆出租车\N

	有个男人过马路 车子只好停下\N
	The taxi had to stop for a man crossing the street,
	这个男人比平时晚起了5分钟\N

	等那位女子取包裹\N
	for the woman to pick up a package
	而包裹还没打包好\N
	which hadn't been wrapped yet,
	因为打包的女孩\N
	because the girl who was supposed to wrap it
	前一晚和她男朋友分手 然后就忘了\N
	had broken up with her boyfriend the night before and forgot.
	打包好之后 女子回到出租车上\N
	When the package was wrapped, the woman, who was back in the cab,
	又被一辆货车挡住去路\N

	这时候 Daisy正在穿衣服\N
	All the while, Daisy was getting dressed.
	货车开走了 出租车重新上路\N
	The delivery truck pulled away, and the taxi was able to move
	Daisy最后一个穿好衣服\N

	出租车停下等红绿灯时\N
	While the taxi was stopped, waiting for a traffic light,
	Daisy和她朋友从剧院后门出来\N
	Daisy and her friend came out the back of the theater.
	如果有一件事不一样\N
	And if only one thing had happened differently,
	如果鞋带没有断\N
	if that shoelace hadn't broken
	如果那货车早一点开走\N
	or that delivery truck had moved moments earlier
	或者包裹早已打包好\N
	or that package had been wrapped and ready
	因为女孩没跟她男朋友分手\N
	because the girl hadn't broken up with her boyfriend,
	或者那个男人定了闹钟 早起5分钟\N
	or that man had set his alarm and got up five minutes earlier
	或者司机没有停下来买咖啡\N
	or that taxi driver hadn't stopped for a cup of coffee
	或者那个女子记得带外套\N
	or that woman had remembered
	然后上了前一辆出租车\N
	her coat and got into an earlier cab,
	Daisy和她朋友就能安全穿过马路\N
	Daisy and her friend would have crossed the street
	那出租车也只是擦肩而过\N
	and the taxi would have driven by.
	但生活就是这样\N
	But, life being what it is,
	一系列生活的交错和意外\N
	a series of intersecting lives and incidents
	没人能够控制\N
	out of anyone's control,
	出租车没有和她们擦肩而过\N
	that taxi did not go by,
	那时司机又分了神\N
	and that driver was momentarily distracted.
	Daisy\N
	Daisy!
	出租车就撞到了Daisy\N
	And that taxi hit Daisy.

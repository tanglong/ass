	我们死后身体会变成草\N
	When we die, our bodies become the grass...
	而羚羊吃草.\N

	没有   怎么了\N
	No, why?
	因为他们跑了!\N
	Cos there it goes!
	-我们甩掉他们了  -我想是.\N
	-Did we lose 'em?  -I think so.

	它是你儿子\N
	Oh, this is... this is your son?
	-你儿子  -你以前知道吗\N
	-Oh, your son?  -Did you know that?
	不知道.我 我不知道... 不知道   你呢\N

	勇敢\N
	Being brave
	不是指你自己去找麻烦.\N
	doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.
	但你什么也不怕.\N
	But you're not scared of anything.
	今天我是这样.\N
	I was today.
	-今天?   -对.\N
	-You were?  -Yes.
	我以为要失去你.\N
	I thought I might lose you.
	原来国王也会害怕.\N
	I guess even kings get scared.
	-但你知道吗?  -什么?\N
	-But you know what?  -What?
	我觉得这些鬣狗更害怕.\N
	I think those hyenas were even scareder.
	因为没有人敢和你爸爸乱来.\N
	Cos nobody messes with your dad.
	-来这儿   你.  -不要!\N
	-Come here, you.  -Oh, no!
	抓到你了!\N
	Gotcha!
	-我们是好朋友 对吗?  -对.\N
	-We're pals, right?  -Right.
	我们会永远在一起的  对吗\N

	辛巴  我告诉你一些\N
	Simba, let me tell you something
	我父亲曾告诉我的事情.\N
	that my father told me.
	看那些星星.\N
	Look at the stars.
	那些曾经的伟大国王\N
	The great kings of the past
	会从那些星星那儿俯视我们.\N
	Iook down on us from those stars.
	-真的?  -对.\N
	-Really?  -Yes.
	所以你感到孤独时\N
	So whenever you feel alone,
	只要记着这些国王\N
	just remember that those kings
	会一直在那儿守护着你.\N
	will always be there to guide you.
	我也一样.\N
	And so will I.
	老兄   都是那个大嗓门的Mufasa. 我一个星期都无法坐了.\N
	Man, that lousy Mufasa. I won't be able to sit for a week.
	这并不好笑   Ed.\N
	It's not funny, Ed.
	闭嘴!\N
	Shut up!
	你们能不能住手\N
	Will you knock it off?
	-是他先动手的.  -看看你们自己.\N
	-Well, he started it.  -Look at you guys.
	难怪我们只能在 食物链的底部晃来晃去.\N
	No wonder we're dangling at the bottom of the food chain.
	老兄   我讨厌晃来晃去.\N
	Man, I hate dangling.
	是吗 如果没有这些狮子   我们就会是老大.\N
	Yeah? If it weren't for those lions, we'd be runnin' the joint.
	老兄   我讨厌狮子.\N
	Man, I hate lions.
	-盛气凌人.  -粗鲁.\N
	-So pushy.  -And hairy.
	-卑鄙.  -还有  他们...\N
	-And stinky.  -And, man, are they...
	很丑陋!\N
	Ugly!
	我们狮子才没那么差\N
	Surely we lions are not all that bad.
	Scar. 是你啊.\N
	Oh, Scar. It's just you.
	我们还以为是很重要的人物呢.\N
	We were afraid it was somebody important.
	对   比如   Mufasa.\N
	Yeah, you know, like Mufasa.
	-对.  -我知道.\N
	-Yeah.  -I see.
	-那是权力!  -给我讲讲.\N
	-Now that's power!  -Tell me about it.
	我听到那名字就发抖.\N
	I just hear that name and I shudder.
	再来一次.\N
	Do it again.
	它让我激动.\N
	It tingles me.
	我周围是一群笨蛋.\N
	I'm surrounded by idiots.
	你   Scar   我是说   你是我们一员. 我是说   你是我们的好朋友.\N
	Now, you, Scar, I mean, you're one of us. I mean, you're our pal.
	不胜荣幸.\N
	Charmed.
	我喜欢.他虽然不是国王   但仍然这么正经.\N
	Oh, I like that. He's not king, but he's still so proper.
	喂   你有没有给我们带吃的\N
	Hey, did you bring us anything to eat,
	Scar   老伙计   老朋友 带了吗\N
	Scar, old buddy, old pal? Did ya?
	我觉得你们不配吃这个.\N
	I don't think you really deserve this.
	我只是将它作为礼物给你们\N
	I practically gift-wrapped those cubs for you,
	你们连他们也干不掉.\N
	and you couldn't even dispose of them.
	你知道...\N
	Well, you know...
	它们并没有落单   Scar.\N
	it wasn't exactly like they was alone, Scar.
	对. 我们该怎么做\N
	Yeah. What were we supposed to do?
	杀了 Mufasa\N
	Kill Mufasa?
	完全正确.\N
	Precisely.

	父亲?\N
	Father?
	辛巴   你已不记得我了.\N
	Simba, you have forgotten me.
	不. 我怎么会忘记\N
	No. How could I?
	你忘了自己是谁   所以也忘记了我.\N
	You have forgotten who you are, and so have forgotten me.
	看看你的内心深处   辛巴.\N
	Look inside yourself, Simba.
	你不应该是现在这个样子.\N
	You are more than what you have become.

	Yeah, but it still hurts.
	对   过去仍然会让人心痛.\N
	Oh, yes, the past can hurt.
	在我看来你仍然可以选择逃避\N
	But the way I see it you can either run from it
	或者从中学些东西\N
	or... learn from it.
	明白了吗? 你准备怎么做?\N
	You see?  So what are you going to do?
	首先   拿走你的拐杖.\N

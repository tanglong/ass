	{\3c&H6C3300&}这世界已永久改变\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The world is changed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我从水中触摸到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I feel it in the water.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我从土地中感觉到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I feel it in the earth.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我从空气中嗅到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I smell it in the air.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}过去的一切\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Much that once was
	{\3c&H6C3300&}都已失落\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	is lost.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}被世人所遗忘\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	For none now live who remember it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这一切都从铸造魔戒开始\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It began with the forging of the Great Rings.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}精灵族得到三只戒指\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Elves got three ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们长生不老，也是最有智慧 、最公正的种族\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}矮人族分到七只戒指\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Dwarves assigned to the seven ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们擅长挖掘矿坑，是山洞的巧心工匠\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}而人类\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And nine,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}人类则分到九只戒指\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	nine rings were gifted to the race of Men,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们比别人更贪图权力\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	who, above all else, desire power.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}每只戒指都拥有统治各种族的意志与力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但他们都受到欺骗\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But they were all of them deceived.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}因为另外还有一只被铸造了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	For another ring was made.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}在魔多末日火山的烈焰中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}黑暗魔君索伦暗地里铸造了可以奴役世界的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring
	{\3c&H6C3300&}至尊魔戒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	to control all others.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他在魔戒中注入他的邪恶，残酷\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}以及统治天下的可怕欲望\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and his will to dominate all life.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一只驾驭一切的至尊魔戒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	One Ring to rule them all.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一个接着一个\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	One by one,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}中土世界的自由之士感受到至尊魔戒的力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	the Free Lands of Middle-earth fell to the power of the Ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是有些人群起反抗\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But there were some who resisted.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}人类与精灵组成了最后同盟，携手对抗对抗魔多的邪恶军团\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A Last Alliance of Men and Elves marched against the armies of Mordor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}在险恶的魔多火山下，他们为中土世界的自由而战\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}胜利终于在望\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Victory was near.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是至尊魔戒的力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But the power of the Ring
	{\3c&H6C3300&}却无人能敌\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	could not be undone.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}就在此时\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It was in this moment,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}正当大家都失去希望之际\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	when all hope had faded,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}人皇之子埃西铎举起他父亲的宝剑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's sword.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}索伦，中土世界自由之民的死敌，终于被击败\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth, was defeated.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}至尊魔戒落入埃西铎手中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Ring passed to Isildur,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他只有一次机会永恒地摧毁罪恶\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是人心\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But the hearts of Men
	{\3c&H6C3300&}却很容易受到蛊惑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	are easily corrupted.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}而且魔戒有它自己的意志\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And the Ring of Power has a will of its own.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}它背叛了埃西铎\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It betrayed Isildur
	{\3c&H6C3300&}最后将他害死\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	to his death.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}于是那些不应被遗忘的东西\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And some things that should not have been forgotten
	{\3c&H6C3300&}也逐渐遗失\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	were lost.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}历史成为传说\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	History became legend,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}传说成为神话\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	legend became myth.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}两千五百年来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And for two and a half thousand years,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}至尊魔戒的下落无人得知\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	the Ring passed out of all knowledge.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}命运巧妙的安排\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Until, when chance came,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}让它蛊惑一个新的持有者\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	it ensnared a new bearer.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我的宝贝\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My precious.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}至尊魔戒落入咕噜手中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Ring came to the creature Gollum,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}带着这枚戒指，他无声无息的消失在迷雾山脉之中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他的身心完全被魔戒占据\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And there it consumed him.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}它属于我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It came to me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这是我的，我的爱，我一个人的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My own. My love. My own.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我的宝贝\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My precious.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}至尊魔戒使咕噜获得违反自然的长寿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}五百年来它扭曲他的心智\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	For 500 years it poisoned his mind.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}而在阴暗潮湿的洞穴之中，它静静的等待着\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}黑暗再度笼罩大地\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}谣传东方聚起邪恶的力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Rumor grew of a shadow in the East,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}人们心中产生无言的恐惧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	whispers of a nameless fear.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}于是至尊魔戒知道\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And the Ring of Power perceived,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}它即将再度现身\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	its time had now come.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}它舍弃了咕噜\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It abandoned Gollum.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是出乎意料之外\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But something happened then the Ring did not intend.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}它被一个料想不到的人捡到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这是什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What's this?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一个霍比特人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A Hobbit.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}夏尔的比尔博·巴金斯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一只戒指\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不见了！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Lost!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我的宝贝不见了！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My precious is lost!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不久的将来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	For the time will soon come,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}霍比特人将决定世界的命运\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}夏尔纪元\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The 22nd day of September,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一四零零年\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	in the year 1400,

	{\3c&H6C3300&}《去而复返·霍比特人的故事》\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There and Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}比尔博·巴金斯著\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	By Bilbo Baggins.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}现在\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Now,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我该怎么起头呢？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	where to begin?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}对了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Ah, yes.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}关于\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Concerning
	{\3c&H6C3300&}霍比特人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hobbits.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}千百年来，霍比特人一直都定居在夏尔的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hobbits have been living and farming in the four Farthings of the Shire
	{\3c&H6C3300&}四个大区务农\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	for many hundreds of years，
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们完全无视于外界的存在\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	quite content to ignore and be ignored
	{\3c&H6C3300&}也满足于被外界忽视的状态\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	by the world of the Big Folk.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}毕竟中土世界充满了数不清的奇异生物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Middle-earth being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}霍比特人则显得并不引人注目\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hobbits must seem of little importance,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}因为我们既不是骁勇的战士\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	being neither renowned as great warriors
	{\3c&H6C3300&}也不被认为特别有智慧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	nor counted among the very wise.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多，有人在敲门\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo! Someone at the door.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}事实上，有人曾经评论过\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	In fact, it has been remarked by some
	{\3c&H6C3300&}霍比特人唯一真正热爱的就是美食\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这评论相当不公平\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A rather unfair observation
	{\3c&H6C3300&}因为我们也对酿啤酒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales
	{\3c&H6C3300&}和抽烟斗有浓厚的兴趣\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and the smoking of pipe-weed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是真正让我们热爱的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But where our hearts truly lie
	{\3c&H6C3300&}还是和平宁静的生活\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	is in peace and quiet,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}与平整肥沃的农耕地\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and good, tilled earth.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}所有的霍比特人都衷心热爱生长的植物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}无庸置疑，我们的生活方式对其他人而言非常奇特\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And, yes, no doubt to others, our ways seem quaint.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}特别是今天\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But today of all days,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}安享宁谧的生活其实不赖\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多，有人在敲门\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo! The door!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}讨厌\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sticklebacks.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-那孩子跑到哪里去了  -弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Where is that boy?   -Frodo!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}眼前道路无止尽\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Down from the door where it began
	{\3c&H6C3300&}蜿蜒崎岖又漫长\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And I must follow if I can
	{\3c&H6C3300&}虽然路程尚遥远\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The road goes ever on and on
	{\3c&H6C3300&}眼前道路无止尽\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Down from the door where it began
	{\3c&H6C3300&}虽然路程尚遥远\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Now far ahead the road has gone
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-但我一定要继续前进  -你迟到了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-And I must follow if I can  -You're late.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}巫师既不会迟到，也不会早到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多·巴金斯，他总是说到就到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}见到你真好，甘道夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你不会认为我会错过你伯伯比尔博的生日吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo birthday?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那个老家伙还好吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	How is the old rascal?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}听说生日宴会非常盛大\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I hear it's going to be a party of special magnificence.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你也知道比尔博的性子，他把这儿搞得鸡飞狗跳\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You know Bilbo. He's got the whole place in an uproar.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这样他应该高兴了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Well, that should please him.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}夏尔有一半的人被邀请\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Half the Shire's been invited.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}另一半也不请自来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And the rest of them are turning up anyway.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}夏尔的日子就这样继续下去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And so life in the Shire goes on,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}跟上个纪元没有什么不同\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	very much as it has this past Age,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}有人来就有人离去，改变很缓慢的进行着\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	full of its own comings and goings, with change coming slowly.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}如果那真的称得上是什么改变的话\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If it comes at all.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}夏尔的一切都井然有序\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	For things are made to endure in the Shire,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一代一代的传承下去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	passing from one generation to the next.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}巴金斯家族一直都住在\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's always been a Baggins living here under the Hill
	{\3c&H6C3300&}袋底洞的山丘下\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	in Bag End.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}也会永远住在那里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And there always will be.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}说真的，比尔博最近怪怪的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	To tell you the truth, Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我是说，比平常更怪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I mean, more than usual.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他常常把自己关在书房里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's taken to locking himself in his study.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}花好几个小时研究那些旧地图，他以为我没看到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He spends hours poring over old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}它跑到哪儿去了？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Where's it gone?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他好像在搞什么名堂\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's up to something.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-好吧，你不说算了  -什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-All right, then. Keep your secrets.  -What?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我知道这一定跟你有关\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But I know you have something to do with it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我可是冤枉的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Good gracious me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}在你出现之前，巴金斯家族的声誉一向都很好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Before you came along, we Bagginses were very well thought of.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}的确\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Indeed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们从不冒险或犯规\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}如果你指的是恶龙，那件事可与我无关\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I was barely involved.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我只是推了你叔叔一把\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不管怎样，你都正式被列为捣乱分子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Whatever you did, you've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}真的吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, really?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}甘道夫，甘道夫！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gandalf! Gandalf!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}放烟火，甘道夫！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Fireworks, Gandalf!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-甘道夫  -放烟火，甘道夫！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Gandalf!  -Fireworks, Gandalf!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}甘道夫？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gandalf?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我很高兴你回来了  -我也是，好孩子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-I'm glad you're back.  -So am I, dear boy.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我也是……\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So am I.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不要，多谢了！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No, thank you!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我不欢迎访客，祝寿者或远亲\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We don't want any more visitors, well-wishers or distant relations!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}如果是一个老朋友呢？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And what about very old friends?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}甘道夫？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gandalf?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-比尔博·巴金斯  -亲爱的甘道夫！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Bilbo Baggins.  -My dear Gandalf!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}见到你真好，111岁大寿，谁会相信？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Good to see you. 111 years old! Who would believe it?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你一点都没老\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You haven't aged a day.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}请进，快进来吧！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come on, come in!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}欢迎，欢迎\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Welcome, welcome.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}来吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, here we are.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}喝杯茶，或是小酌两杯？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Tea? Or maybe something a little stronger?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我还有几瓶1296年的陈年好酒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I've got a few bottles of the Old Winyard left. 1296.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}很好的年分，几乎跟我一样老\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Very good year. Almost as old as I am.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我父亲珍藏的，开一瓶如何？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It was laid down by my father. What say we open one, eh?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我喝茶就好，谢谢\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Just tea, thank you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你上礼拜就该到了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I was expecting you sometime last week.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}其实也没关系，你什么时候来都没关系\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not that it matters. You come and go as you please. Always have and always will.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}只是我有点措手不及，家里只有冻鸡和腌黄瓜\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}还有乳酪，不行，太寒酸了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's some cheese here. No, that won't do.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我有覆盆子果酱，苹果馅饼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但没什么其他可以当甜点的了，噢，不，现在可有了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But not much for afters. Oh, no, we're all right.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我找到一些海绵蛋糕\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I've just found some sponge cake.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}孤山\N{\fn微软雅黑}{\fs15}
	The Lonely Mountain.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我可以煮几颗蛋\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I could make you some eggs if you'd.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}跑到哪儿去了？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Run where were you?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-茶就行了，谢谢  -好吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Just tea, thank you.  -Oh, right.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-介意我先吃吗？  -你尽管吃吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-You don't mind if I eat, do you?  -No, not at all.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}比尔博！比尔博·巴金斯！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我可不在家！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm not at home!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}是塞克维尔·巴金斯家的人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's the Sackville-Bagginses.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我知道你在家  -他们想要这房子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-I know you're in there!  -They're after the house.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我活了这么久，他们还不肯放过我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They've never forgiven me for living this long.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我被这些烦人的亲戚\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I've got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}吵得一刻不得安宁\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	never giving me a moment's peace.
	高耸的山脉，甘道夫！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I want to see mountains again. Mountains, Gandalf!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}然后找一个安静的地方写写书……噢，茶好了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-你真的要实行你的计划吗？  -对，一切都在计划中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-So you mean to go through with your plan?  -Yes, yes. It's all in hand.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我全都安排好了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	All the arrangements are made.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}噢，谢谢你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, thank you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}佛罗多起了疑心\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo suspects something.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}当然了，他可是巴金斯家的人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Of course he does. He's a Baggins,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不是布罗克海德家的笨小孩\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你会告诉他吧？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You will tell him, won't you?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-会的  -他很爱你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Yes, yes.  -He's very fond of you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我知道\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I know.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我开口的话，他一定会跟我去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He'd probably come with me if I asked him.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是我知道，他还是衷心深爱夏尔的家园\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I think in his heart, Frodo's still in love with the Shire.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}绿油油的树林和草地\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The woods, the fields.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}潺潺的溪流\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Little rivers.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我老了，甘道夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I am old, Gandalf.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}虽然我看起来并不老，但是我的心老了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我的意志变得很薄弱\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I feel thin.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一切感觉起来都索然无味\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sort of stretched,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}就像没涂够黄油的面包\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	like butter scraped over too much bread.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我需要一个假期，一个很长的假期\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I need a holiday. A very long holiday.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}而我并不打算回来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And I don't expect I shall return.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}事实上，我打定主意不回来了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	In fact, I mean not to.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}老托比种的，南区最棒的烟草\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Old Toby. The finest weed in the Southfarthing.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}甘道夫，我的老朋友\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gandalf, my old friend,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}今晚将永生难忘\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	this will be a night to remember.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你好，你们好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hello, hello.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}小胖博哲，很高兴见到你，欢迎，欢迎\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you. Welcome, welcome.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}山姆，快去邀罗丝跳舞\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我还是再喝一杯啤酒吧  -不，你不能喝了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-I think I'll just have another ale.  -Oh, no, you don't.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}快去呀！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Go on!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我站在那儿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So there I was
	{\3c&H6C3300&}面对三个可怕的食人妖\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}它们争吵着\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And they were all arguing amongst themselves
	{\3c&H6C3300&}要怎么把我们煮来吃\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	about how they were going to cook us.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}是一口就把我们给吞了，还是一个接着一个把我们压成肉酱\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit on us one by one, squash us into jelly.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们喋喋不休吵个没完没了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They spent so much time arguing the whithertos and the whyfors
	{\3c&H6C3300&}直到天边亮起第一丝曙光\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	that the sun's first light crept over the top of the trees
	{\3c&H6C3300&}甘道夫把他们都变成了石头！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and turned them all to stone!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}快点\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Quickly.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}飞走喽！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Up they go!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不，拿最大的那个！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No, the big one!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}布雷斯太太，真高兴看到你，欢迎，欢迎\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you. Welcome, welcome.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这些都是你的孩子吗\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Are all these children yours?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}天啊，你还真能生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Good gracious, you have been productive.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}比尔博？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bilbo?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}是塞克维尔·巴金斯！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sackville-Bagginses!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}快，快躲起来！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Quickly, hide!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}孩子，谢谢你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Thank you, my boy.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你是个好小伙子，弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You're a good lad, Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我一直都很自私\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm very selfish, you know.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}是的，一直都自私自利\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes, I am. Very selfish.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我不知道为什么，当你父母去世后我会想收养你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't know why I took you in after your mother and father died,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但那不是因为我想做善事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	but it wasn't out of charity.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我想也许那是因为\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I think it was because
	{\3c&H6C3300&}在我那么多的亲戚当中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	of all my numerous relations,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你是最富有冒险精神的人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-比尔博，你偷偷喝酒了吗？  -没有\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew?  -No.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}好吧，我喝了，但那不是重点\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Well, yes, but that's not the point.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}重点是，弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The point is, Frodo,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一切都会好起来的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	you'll be all right.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-好！  -你居然把他插在地上？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Done!  -You're supposed to stick it in the ground.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-就应该插在地上呀  -那也应该插到外面去！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-It is in the ground.  -Outside!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}都是你出的馊主意！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This was your idea!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}比尔博\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bilbo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}比尔博，当心那只飞龙！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}胡扯，这里已经有一千年没出现什么飞龙了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-太棒了  -咱们再来一次吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-That was good.  -Let's get another one.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}梅里亚达克·布兰德巴克和皮瑞格林·图克！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我早该料到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I might've known.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}致辞，比尔博！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Speech, Bilbo!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}致辞！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Speech!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}致辞！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Speech!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}亲爱的巴金斯家和波芬家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My dear Bagginses and Boffins,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}图克家和布兰德巴克家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Tooks and Brandybucks,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}葛鲁伯家，丘伯家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Grubbs, Chubbs,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}吹号者家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hornblowers,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}博哲家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bolgers,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}布雷斯家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bracegirdles,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-和傲脚家  -是傲足！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-and Proudfoots.  -Proudfeet!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}今天是我111岁生日！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Today is my 111th birthday!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}生日快乐！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Happy birthday!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是和你们这群优秀的霍比特人住在一起\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But alas, eleventh-one years is far too short a time to live among
	{\3c&H6C3300&}111年也显得太短了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	such excellent and admirable Hobbits.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我只认识你们之中一小部分人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't know half of you half as well as I should like
	{\3c&H6C3300&}而你们值得我更多的热爱\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我要做一件事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have things to do.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这件事我拖了太久\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I've put this off far too long.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}很遗憾我要宣布，宴会结束了！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I regret to announce this is the end!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我要走了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm going now.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我要向大家道别\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I bid you all a very fond farewell.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}再见了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Goodbye.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你一定觉得这招很高明\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I suppose you think that was terribly clever.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你没看到他们的表情吗，甘道夫？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come on, Gandalf. Did you see their faces?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}世上有许多神奇的戒指，但是都不该随便乱用\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There are many magic rings in this world, and none of them should be used lightly.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我只是开个玩笑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It was just a bit of fun.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不过就像平时一样，你说的对\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, you're probably right, as usual.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-你会替我照顾好弗罗多吧  -一定会\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?  -Two eyes.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我会尽力照顾他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	As often as I can spare them.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我要把一切都留给他  -那只戒指呢\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-I'm leaving everything to him.  -What about this ring of yours?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-那也要留下来吗  -当然了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Is that staying too?  -Yes, yes.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我用信封装好放在壁炉上面\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不对，等一下\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No. Wait,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}它在我的口袋\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	it's here in my pocket.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}真奇怪，不是吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Isn't that? Isn't that odd, now?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}是啊，有何不可呢？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yet, after all, why not?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我何不留着呢？  -你应该把戒指留下来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Why shouldn I keep it?  -I think you should leave the ring behind.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}留下它有这么困难吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Is that so hard?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}没有呀\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Well, no.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}当然有\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And yes.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}现在我突然不想把它给别人了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Now it comes to it, I don't feel like parting with it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}它是我的，是我找到它的 ，它独属于我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's mine. I found it! It came to me!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-你也没必要动肝火吧  -我动肝火也全都是因为你的错！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-There's no need to get angry.  -Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

	It's mine.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我一个人的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My own.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我的宝贝  -宝贝？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-My precious.  -Precious?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}以前也有别人这么叫过它，那个人不是你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's been called that before, but not by you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这是我的戒指，与你无关！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What business is it of yours what I do with my own things!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那只戒指你留着够久了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I think you've had that ring quite long enough.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-你是想独吞它！  -比尔博·巴金斯！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-You want it for yourself!  -Bilbo Baggins!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}别以为我是只会坑蒙拐骗的江湖术士\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.

	I am not trying to rob you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我只想帮助你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	{\3c&H6C3300&}放手吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let it go.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你说的对，甘道夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You're right, Gandalf.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}戒指一定要留给弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The ring must go to Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}天色晚了，路还很长\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's late. The road is long.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}是的，是出发的时候\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes, it is time.

	The ring is in your pocket.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我替我的书想到一个结尾\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I've thought up an ending for my book.

	"And he lived happily ever after to the end of his days."
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你一定会的，我的老友\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

	My precious.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}宝贝\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Precious.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他走了，对吧？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's gone, hasn't he?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他一直都说要离开这儿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He talked for so long about leaving.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}没想到他真的走了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I didn't think he'd really do it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}甘道夫？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gandalf?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}比尔博的戒指\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bilbo's ring.

	He's gone to stay with the Elves.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他把贝格恩留给你了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's left you Bag End.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}还有他所有的财产\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	{\3c&H6C3300&}-把它藏起来  -你要去哪儿？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Put it somewhere out of sight.  -Where are you going?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我必须去办一些事  -什么事？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-There are some things that I must see to.  -What things?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我有一些疑问一定要得到解答  -可你你才刚到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Questions. Questions that need answering.  -You've only just arrived.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我不明白\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't understand.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我也不明白\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Neither do I.

	{\3c&H6C3300&}以及找到至尊魔戒的记载\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and the finding of the Ring of Power.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我终于拿到它了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It has come to me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这只至尊魔戒，将是王国的镇国之宝\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The One Ring. It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我的后代将永远对它效忠\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	All those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate
	{\3c&H6C3300&}它决不能受到任何的伤害\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	for I will risk no hurt to the Ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这是我的宝贝\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It is precious to me,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我经历了多少的痛苦才得到它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	though I buy it with great pain.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}指环上的刻痕逐渐褪色\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The markings upon the band begin to fade.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}初入炽焰一般闪耀的文字，现在也全部消失\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}只有置身火焰之中才能让文字重现\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A secret now that only fire can tell.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}夏尔\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Shire.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}巴金斯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Baggins.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}巴金斯家族不住这里，他们在霍比屯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's no Bagginses around here. They're all up in Hobbiton.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那边\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That way.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}暂借烈酒驱忧愁\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hey, ah, bottle I came.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}平我心绪缓我忧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	To heal my heart and drown my woe.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}尽管雨打风又刮\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Rain may fall and wind may blow.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我却紧走不将休\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But there still be.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}尚有万千路须行\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Many miles to go.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}落雨之声多美妙\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}潺潺溪流也温柔\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And the stream that falls From hill to plain.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不管雨水与清泉\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Better than rain or rippling brook.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}都不比这儿的啤酒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Is a mug of beer inside this Took.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}最近边境有些怪人出没\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}包括矮人和其他更邪恶的生物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}恐怕是要开战了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	War is brewing.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}漫山遍野都是哥布林\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}全都是些谣传还有骗小孩的故事，仅此而已了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Far-off tales and children stories, that's all that is.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你越来越像老比尔博·巴金斯了，疯疯癫癫的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You're beginning to sound like that old Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多先生在这儿呢，不过他的确有些疯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我为他感到自豪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm proud of it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-干杯，老爹  -干杯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Cheers, Gaffer.  -Cheers.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}外部世界与我们无关\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}只要我们不去找麻烦，麻烦就不会找上门\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Keep your nose out of trouble, and no trouble'll come to you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-大家晚安  -晚安\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Good night, lads.  -Good night.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}晚安，美丽的姑娘\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}小心谁在跟你甜言蜜语\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mind who you're sweet-taking.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}别担心，山姆，罗丝知道他是个混球\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}真的吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Does she?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-晚安  山姆  -晚安，弗罗多先生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Good night, Sam.  -Good night, Mister Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你有守密吗？它安全吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Is it secret? Is it safe?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你在干什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What are you doing?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}把手伸出来，弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hold out your hand, Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}很凉的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's quite cool.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你能看到什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What can you see?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你能看到什么吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Can you see anything?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}什么也没有\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Nothing.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}什么也没看见\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's nothing.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}等等\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Wait.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}上面有刻痕\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There are markings.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}好像是某种精灵文，我看不懂\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's some form of Elvish. I can't read it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}很少有人能看得懂\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There are few who can.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这是魔多的古文字，但我现在不能念出来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}魔多？！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mordor?!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}其上的刻痕用通用语来说是\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	In the common tongue, it says,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}至尊戒，驭众戒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	One Ring to rule them all,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}至尊戒，寻众戒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	One Ring to find them,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}魔戒至尊引众戒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	One Ring to bring them all,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}禁锢众戒黑暗中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and in the darkness bind them.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这就是至尊魔戒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This is the One Ring
	{\3c&H6C3300&}是黑暗魔君索伦以末日火山的烈焰铸成的众戒之王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}埃西铎从索伦手中夺了过来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Taken by IsiIdur from the hand of Sauron himself.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}比尔博找到它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bilbo found it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-在咕鲁的洞穴中  -是的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-In Gollum's cave.  -Yes.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}六十年来，比尔博不动声色地持有至尊魔戒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他因而延长了寿命，延迟了老化\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	prolonging his life, delaying old age.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是一切已时过境迁，弗罗多，黑暗势力已在魔多重聚\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But no longer, Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}至尊魔戒已经醒来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Ring has awoken.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}它听到了主人的召唤\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's heard its master's call.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是他已经被消灭了，索伦已经被消灭了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But he was destroyed. Sauron was destroyed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不，弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No, Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}索伦的灵魂是不死的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The spirit of Sauron endured.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他的命运和至尊魔戒紧紧相连，而至尊魔戒幸存\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	His life force is bound to the Ring, and the Ring survived.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}黑暗魔君重塑了肉身\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sauron has returned.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他的半兽人大军与日俱增\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	His Orcs have multiplied.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}黑暗要塞巴拉多也被重建\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	His fortress at Barad-dur is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}索伦只需要这枚戒指，就能让黑暗再度笼罩大地\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sauron needs only this Ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他在搜寻它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He is seeking it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}全心全意，不择手段地搜寻\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Seeking it. All his thought is bent on it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}同时至尊魔戒也渴望\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	For the Ring yearns above all else
	{\3c&H6C3300&}重回主人的手中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	to return to the hand of its master.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们本为一体\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They are one,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}至尊魔戒和黑暗魔君\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	the Ring and the Dark Lord.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo
	{\3c&H6C3300&}绝对不能让他找到至尊魔戒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	he must never find it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	All right.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们把它藏起来，从此再也不提\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We put it away. We keep it hidden. We never speak of it again.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}没人知道它在这儿，对不对？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No one knows it's here, do they?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}对不对，甘道夫？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do they, Gandalf?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}有一个人知道比尔博得到至尊魔戒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我四处寻找咕鲁\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是魔君先我一步\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But the enemy found him first.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他不晓得被严刑拷打了多久\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't know how long they tortured him.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但在歇斯底里的哀嚎和呻吟声中，他们听出两个名字\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}夏尔！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Shire!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}巴金斯！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Baggins!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}夏尔？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Shire.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}巴金斯？他们会找到这儿来！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Baggins. But that would Iead them here!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}什么人？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Who goes there?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你拿去，甘道夫！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Take it, Gandalf!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-快拿走！  -不行，弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Take it!  -No, Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-你一定要拿去！  -你不能把魔戒给我！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-You must take it!  -You cannot offer me this ring!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我要把它给你！  -千万别引诱我，弗罗多！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-I'm giving it to you!  -Don't tempt me, Frodo!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我不敢拿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I dare not take it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}更无法保护它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not even to keep it safe.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你要了解，弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Understand, Frodo,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我只希望利用至尊魔戒行善事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I would use this Ring from a desire to do good.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是透过我，魔戒将释放无法想像的邪恶力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-但是魔戒不能留在夏尔  -没错\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-But it cannot stay in the Shire!  -No.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}是的，的确不能\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No, it can't.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我该怎么做\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What must I do?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-你需要马上离开，越快越好  -去哪里，我要去哪里？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-You must leave. And leave quickly.  -Where? Where do I go?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}离开夏尔，赶到布理村\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Get out of the Shire. Make for the village of Bree.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}布理\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bree.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-那你呢？  -我会在\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-What about you?  -I'll be waiting for you
	{\3c&H6C3300&}跃马旅店等你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	at the inn of the Prancing Pony.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-魔戒在那儿安全吗？  -我不知道，弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-And the Ring will be safe there?  -I don't know, Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我无法回答你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't have any answers.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我必须去见巫师长，他既有智慧又力量强大。相信我，弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I must see the head of my order. He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他知道该怎么做\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He'll know what to do.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你不能用巴金斯的姓氏了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You'll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这名字在夏尔之外不安全\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That name is not safe outside the Shire.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}只能在白天赶路，记得别走大道\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Travel only by day. And stay off the road.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我可以穿过农田\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I can cut across country easily enough.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多，好孩子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My dear Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}霍比特人真的不可思议\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hobbits really are amazing creatures.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}只要一个月，你就能自以为了解他们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}然而过了一百年后\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And yet, after a hundred years,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们却仍然能让你吃惊\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	they can still surprise you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}趴下来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Get down.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}可恶的山姆卫斯·甘吉，你一直在偷听吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee! Have you been eavesdropping?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我才没有偷听什么，我只是在窗外除草而已\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest. I was cutting the grass under the window.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}现在除草未免太晚了，不是吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我听到有人大声说话  -你听到什么？快说！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-I heard raised voices.  -What did you hear? Speak!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}没什么\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Nothing important.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我听到关于什么戒指，黑暗魔君和世界末日\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That is, I heard a good deal about a ring, a Dark Lord and the end of the world, but.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}甘道夫先生，别伤害我，别把我变成死的东西\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me. Don't turn me into anything unnatural.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不要吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}也许不会\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Perhaps not.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你有更好的用处\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I've thought of a better use for you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}快点，山姆卫斯，跟上来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come along, Samwise. Keep up.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你们千万要小心\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Be careful, both of you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}敌人有很多眼线\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The enemy has many spies in his service.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}飞鸟，野兽\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Birds, beasts.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}戒指安全码？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Is it safe?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}千万别戴上\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Never put it on
	{\3c&H6C3300&}黑暗魔君的爪牙会被邪恶的力量吸引来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	for the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多，你要记住\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Always remember, Frodo,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}至尊魔戒想要回到主人手上\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	the Ring is trying to get back to its master.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}它想要被找到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It wants to be found.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这就是了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This is it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这是什么\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This is what?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我只要再跨一步\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If I take one more step,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}就是我离家最远的一次\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}走吧，山姆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come on, Sam.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我记得比尔博老是说\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Remember what Bilbo used to say,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-旅行很危险，弗罗多  -一旦你出了门\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-it's a dangerous business, Frodo.  -Going out your door,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}走在了道上，一旦你不专心看路\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	you step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}谁晓得你会被带到哪里去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	there's no knowing where you might be swept off to.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}山姆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sam.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}木精灵\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Wood-elves.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们要去白塔外的港湾\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They're going to the harbor beyond the White Towers.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}去往灰港岸\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	To the Grey Havens.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们要离开中土世界\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They're leaving Middle-earth.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}永远不再回来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Never to return.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不知道为什么\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't know why,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我觉得很悲伤\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	it makes me sad.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不管躺在那儿都是盘根错节的，顶着我的后背\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Everywhere I lie there's a dirty great root sticking into my back.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}闭上眼睛\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Just shut your eyes,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}想像你回到自己的床上\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and imagine you're back in your own bed
	{\3c&H6C3300&}上面有柔软的床垫和舒适的羽毛枕头\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}没用的，弗罗多先生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's not working, Mr. Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}在荒郊野外的根本睡不着\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm never going to be able to sleep out here.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我也睡不着，山姆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Me neither, Sam.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}末日火山再度升起烟硝\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}时间不多了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The hour grows late.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}所以灰袍巫师甘道夫匆忙赶到艾辛格\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard
	{\3c&H6C3300&}寻求我的建议\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	seeking my counsel.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你就是为了这件事而来吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	For that is why you have come, is it not?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我的老友\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My old friend.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}萨鲁曼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Saruman.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-你确定吗？  -千真万确\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-You are sure of this?  -Beyond any doubt.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}至尊魔戒被发现了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So the Ring of Power has been found.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这么多年来，一直悄悄藏身于夏尔\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	All these long years, it was in the Shire.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-就在我眼前  -你却没有发现\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Under my very nose.  -Yet you did not have the wit to see it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}半身人的烟草熏坏了你的脑子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Your love of the halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是还来得及，还有时间对抗索伦的势力\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But we still have time. Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}时间？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Time?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们还哪来的时间？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What time do you think we have?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}索伦的力量几乎完全恢复\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sauron has regained much of his former strength.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}虽然他的肉身尚未重塑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He cannot yet take physical form,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但他灵魂的力量强大无比\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	but his spirit has lost none of its potency.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}虽然被困在要塞中，可是他却无所不知\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他的视线能穿透乌云，阴影，土地，甚至肉体\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你知道我在说什么吗，甘道夫？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You know of what I speak, Gandalf?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一个被烈焰包围的可怖的魔眼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A Great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那就是索伦之眼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Eye of Sauron.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他正在召集所有邪恶的力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He is gathering all evil to him.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}很快的，他就能集结一支强大的军队\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Very soon, he'll have summoned an army
	{\3c&H6C3300&}而中土世界也将会覆亡\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你居然知道这些？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You know this?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}怎么可能？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	How?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我亲眼看到的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have seen it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}真知晶球是个危险的工具，萨鲁曼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}为什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Why?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}为什么要害怕使用它？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Why should we fear to use it?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}其他的真知之石下落不明\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They are not all accounted for, the lost Seeing-stones.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们不知道还有谁也在看\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We do not know who else may be watching.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一切都太晚了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The hour is later than you think.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}索伦的行动已经展开\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sauron's forces are already moving.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那九个已经离开米那斯魔窟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Nine have left Minas Morgul.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那九个？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Nine?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们在仲夏夜跨越艾辛河\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They crossed the River Isen on Midsummer's Eve
	{\3c&H6C3300&}伪装成黑骑士\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	disguised as riders in black.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-他们已经到了夏尔？  -他们会找到至尊魔戒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-They've reached the Shire?  -They will find the Ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}然后杀死它的持有者\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And kill the one who carries it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你不会真幼稚到以为霍比特人能对抗索伦吧？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You did not seriously think that a Hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}谁也对抗不了他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There are none who can.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}所有对抗魔多的人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Against the power of Mordor,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}都是死路一条\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	there can be no victory.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们必须加入他们，甘道夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We must join with him, Gandalf.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们必须投靠索伦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We must join with Sauron.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这么做才聪明，朋友\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It would be wise, my friend.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}告诉我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Tell me,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}朋友\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	friend,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}智者萨鲁曼几时发疯了？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我给你机会\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I gave you the chance of
	{\3c&H6C3300&}自愿帮助我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	aiding me willingly,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是你却宁愿选择受苦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	but you have elected the way of pain!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多先生？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mr. Frodo?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多？弗罗多！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo? Frodo!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我还以为我把你给跟丢了  -你在说什么\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-I thought I'd lost you.  -What are you taking about?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-甘道夫跟我说过  -他说什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-It's just something Gandalf said.  -What did he say?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}“紧跟着他，山姆卫斯·甘吉”，而我也一定会紧紧跟着你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee." And I don't mean to.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}山姆，我们还在夏尔，会有什么事？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sam, we're still in the Shire. What could possibly happen?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-梅里，是弗罗多·巴金斯  -你好，弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.  -Hello, Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你给我起来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Get off him.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}起来，弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come on, Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这算什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What's the meaning of this?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你们又偷摘老农夫马嘎的菜！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}快给我滚出去！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You get back here!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}快从我的地里滚出去！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Get out of my field!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}要是被我抓到就够你们受的！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}生什么气嘛，不过是两根红萝卜\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't know why he's so upset. It's only a couple of carrots.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}还有几棵卷心菜\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And some cabbages.

	{\3c&H6C3300&}噢，太险了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, that was close.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我好像摔断了什么\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}什么？这可是条捷径耶\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	{\3c&H6C3300&}听口音是从夏尔来，你们上这儿有何贵干？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	All right, young sir. I meant no offense.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}天黑后我就得多问一下\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's my job to ask questions after nightfall.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}听说附近有怪人游荡\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's talk of strange folk abroad.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}小心一点比较好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Can't be too careful.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}小心点，注意脚下！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Out of the way! Watch where you're waking.

	Excuse me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}晚上好，客人们，有什么需要吗\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Good evening, little masters. What can I do for you?
	我们有霍比特人住的舒适房间\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If you're seeking accommodation, we got some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}很乐意为你们服务，请问怎么称呼？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Always proud to cater to the little Folk, Mister?

	Gandal?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}噢，对了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	Get out of my way!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那是什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	{\3c&H6C3300&}伙计，这就是一品脱的啤酒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This, my friend, is a pint.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}有这么大杯的？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It comes in pints?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我也要来一杯  -可你已经喝了很多了！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-I'm getting one.  -You got a whole half already!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们来了之后，那个人一直盯着你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}打扰一下\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Excuse me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}在角落的那位，他是谁？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That Man in the corner. Who is he?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他是一个游侠，他们是成天在荒郊野外游荡的危险人物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我不知道他的名字，但这儿的人都叫他神行客\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What his right name is, I've never heard, but around here he's known as Strider.

	Baggins.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}巴金斯？我认识呀\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他在那儿，弗罗多·巴金斯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's over there. Frodo Baggins.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我是他表哥\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's my second cousin, once removed on his mother's side
	{\3c&H6C3300&}也算是远房亲戚啦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and my third cousin, twice removed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-皮平！  -小心点，弗罗多！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Pippin!  -Steady on, Frodo!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你躲不了的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You cannot hide.

	death.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你太惹人注意了  “山下”先生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You draw far too much attention to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你想怎么样？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What do you want?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}要你小心点，你戴的可不是小玩意儿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A little more caution from you. That is no trinket you carry.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我什么都没戴  -是啊\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-I carry nothing.  -Indeed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}只要我想，我就能随意遁身\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I can avoid being seen if I wish,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但完全隐形却不是件易事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-你是什么人？  -你害怕吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Who are you?  -Are you frightened?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}害怕\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}光惧怕还远远不够  我知道谁在找你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}放开他！否则我让你好看，长腿的家伙！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let him go! Or I'll have you, Longshanks!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}小霍比特人，你很有勇气，但这救不了你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You have a stout heart, little Hobbit. But that will not save you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你不能再等巫师了，弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们来了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They're coming.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们究竟是什么人？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What are they?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们曾经是人类\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They were once Men.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}人类伟大的国王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Great kings of Men.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是索伦用九只魔戒引诱他们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them nine rings of power.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}而他们利欲熏心，毫不迟疑地收下\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Blinded by their greed, they took them without question.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}结果一一沉沦于黑暗之中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	One by one, falling into darkness.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}成为黑暗魔君的傀儡\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Now they are slaves to his will.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们是纳兹古尔\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They are the Nazgul.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}也就是戒灵，他们介于生与死之间\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们随时感受到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	At all times they feel
	{\3c&H6C3300&}魔戒的存在\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	the presence of the Ring,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}被至尊魔戒吸引着，他们会一直追杀你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	drawn to the power of the One. They will never stop hunting you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-你要带我们去哪儿？  -荒野\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Where are you taking us?  -Into the wild.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你怎么知道神行客是甘道夫的朋友？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我觉得敌人的仆役会看起来面带微笑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-但骨子里却很凶恶  -他够让人厌恶了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-and feel fouler.  -He's foul enough.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}没办法，我们只能相信他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We have no choice, but to trust him.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-他要带我们去哪里？  -瑞文戴尔，甘吉先生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	-You've already had it.  -We've had one, yes.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那第二顿早餐呢？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What about second breakfast?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}皮平，他不知道有第二顿早餐\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那早午餐呢？午餐，下午茶，晚餐，宵夜呢？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What about elevenses? Luncheon? Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-他应该都知道吧  -我看不见得\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-He knows about them, doesn't he?  -I wouldn count on it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}皮平！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Pippin!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}没有霍比特人的时候，他们吃什么呢？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What do they eat when they can't get Hobbit?

	Who is she?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}歌谣中唱到的女人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This woman you sing of.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}是露西安\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's the lady of Luthien.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}嫁给凡人贝伦的精灵\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	We have work to do.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这些树非常坚韧，主人，树根很深\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The trees are strong, my lord. Their roots go deep.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}把它们全都拉倒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}山姆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, Sam.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}神行客！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Strider!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-快救救他，神行客  -他被戒灵的剑刺中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Help him, Strider.  -He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我救不了他，精灵才有办法\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This is beyond my skill to heal. He needs Elvish medicine.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}快点！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hurry!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}离瑞文戴尔还有六天行程，他撑不下去的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We're six days from Rivendell! He'll never make it!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你要撑下去，弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hold on, Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}甘道夫！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gandalf!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你看，弗罗多，是被比尔博变成石头的食人妖\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多先生？他摸起来好冷\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他会死吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Is he going to die?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他正在进入冥界，很快也会成为死灵\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's passing into the Shadow World. He'll soon become a Wraith like them.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-他们就在附近  -山姆，你知道阿夕拉斯草吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-They're close.  -Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-阿夕拉斯？  -又叫王之剑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Athelas?  -Kingsfoil.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}王之剑，那是一种草药\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那能阻缓毒性发作，快去采\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It may help to slow the poisoning. Hurry!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}怎么了，游侠竟然毫无防备？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What's this? A Ranger caught off his guard?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我是亚玟，我来帮助你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Im Arwen. Telin le thaed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}回到光明中来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Came to light.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}她是谁？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Who is she?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-她是个精灵  -他快失去意识了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-She's an Elf.  -He's fading.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他撑不了多久的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's not going to last.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一定要带他去找我父亲\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We must get him to my father.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我找了你两天  -你们要带他去哪儿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-I've been looking for you for two days.  -Where are you taking him?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}五名戒灵跟着你，我不知道另外四个在哪里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There are five Wraiths behind you. Where the other four are, I do not know.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}陪着霍比特人，我会来接你们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Dartho guin Berian. Rych le ad tolthathon.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我骑得比较快，我来载他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hon mabathon. Rochon ellint im.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}路上太危险了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Andelu i ven.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们在说什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What are they saying?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多快死了，如果我能渡河\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo is dying. If I can get across the river,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我族人的力量就可以保护他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	the power of my people will protect him.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我不怕他们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I do not fear them.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}亚玟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Arwen,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}拼命骑，别回头\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	ride hard. Don't look back.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你在干什么？戒灵正在追杀他！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What are you doing?! Those Wraiths are still out there!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}把半身人交给我，女精灵\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Give up the halfling, She-EIf.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}如果你想要，那就来抢啊\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If you want him, come and claim him.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不，不要！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No. No!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多，你不能死\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo, no.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多，别放弃！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo, don't give in!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}现在不行\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not now.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}请赐给我力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What grace is given me,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}让他度过灾厄\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	let it pass to him.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}让他免于死亡\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let him be spared.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}拯救他的生命\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Save him.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我在哪里？  -你在爱隆王的王宫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Where am I?  -You are in the house of Elrond.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}如果你想知道，现在是十月二十四日，早上十点\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And it is 10：00 in the morning on October 24th, if you want to know.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-甘道夫！  -是的，我在这儿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Gandalf!  -Yes, I'm here.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你没有死算你幸运\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And you're lucky to be here too.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}再过几小时你就没救了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是你的生命力真强，亲爱的霍比特人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But you have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}发生什么事，甘道夫？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What happened, Gandalf?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-你怎么没去找我们？  -对不起，弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Why didn't you meet us?  -I am sorry, Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我有事耽搁了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I was delayed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你不能随便和萨鲁曼绝交\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A friendship with Saruman is not lightly thrown aside.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}别再抗拒了，没有用的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	One ill turn deserves another. It is over.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你不屈从于魔戒的力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Embrace the power of the Ring
	{\3c&H6C3300&}就等着灭亡吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	or embrace your own destruction!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}世上只有一个魔戒之王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There is only one Lord of the Ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}只有他能够驾驭魔戒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Only one who can bend it to his will.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}而他绝不会和你分享权力\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And he does not share power.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}所以你选择了死亡\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So you have chosen death.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}甘道夫，怎么了？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gandalf? What is it?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}没事，弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Nothing, Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-山姆  -你终于醒了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Sam!  -Bless you, you're awake!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}山姆一直守在你身边\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sam has hardly left your side.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们很担心你，对吧，甘道夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We were that worried about you. Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}幸好有爱隆王，你开始痊愈了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're beginning to mend.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}欢迎来到瑞文戴尔，弗罗多·巴金斯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-比尔博！  -弗罗多，好孩子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Bilbo!  -Hello, Frodo, my lad.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}比尔博\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bilbo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}《霍比特人》  比尔博·巴金斯著\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins."
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-太棒了  -我真想再回去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-This is wonderful.  -I meant to go back,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}在幽暗密林的小径上徜徉\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	wonder at the powers of Mirkwood,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}探访长湖镇\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	visit Lake-town,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}再看一眼孤山\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	see the Lonely Mountain again.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是我终于年老力衰了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}夏尔\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Shire.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我好想家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I miss the Shire.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我从小就幻想能到别的地方\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}跟你一起出游，一起去冒险\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Off with you, on one of your adventures.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是我自己的冒险却完全不同\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But my own adventure turned out to be quite different.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我跟你不一样，比尔博\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm not like you, Bilbo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}乖孩子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My dear boy.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我还有什么没收拾好？  -这么快就开始打包了？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Now, what have I forgotten?  -Packed already?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}越早准备越好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No harm in being prepared.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我还以为你想见见精灵  -是啊\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-I thought you wanted to see the Elves.  -I do.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-你想看得不得了  -的确如此\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-More than anything.  -I did.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}只是\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's just.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们完成了甘道夫给予的任务，不是吗\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们把魔戒带到瑞文戴尔，我觉得\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We got the Ring this far, to Rivendell. And I thought
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你的伤快好了，我们也要走了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们要回家了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Off home.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你说的对，山姆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You are right, Sam.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们完成了任务\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We did what we set out to do.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}魔戒在这儿很安全\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我可以回家了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I am ready to go home.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他的力气恢复了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	His strength returns.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但他的伤永远无法痊愈，一辈子都会跟着他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That wound will never fully heal. He will carry it the rest of his life.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一路上的艰难坎坷已经证明了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And yet to have come so far still bearing the Ring,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}霍比特人能够抗拒黑暗势力的诱惑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	the Hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他不该扛下这份重担\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It is a burden he should never have had to bear.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-弗罗多已经尽力了  -敌人正在蠢蠢欲动，甘道夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-We can ask no more of Frodo.  -Gandalf, the enemy is moving.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}索伦的大军在东方集结，他的邪眼正盯着瑞文戴尔\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sauron's forces are massing in the East. His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你还跟我说萨鲁曼也背叛了我们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们已经孤军奋战了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Our list of allies grows thin.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他的恶行远不止此\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	His treachery runs deeper than you know.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他用邪恶的巫术将哥布林与半兽人混合起来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}在艾辛格的洞窟之中，一支邪恶的大军正在酝酿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一支能在白天行军千里的劲旅\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}萨鲁曼要来抢夺至尊魔戒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Saruman is coming for the Ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}精灵无法抵抗这股邪恶力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}更无法对抗双面夹击\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}甘道夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gandalf,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}至尊魔戒不能留在这儿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	the Ring cannot stay here.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}整个中土世界已经危在旦夕\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们必须决定未来何去何从\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They must decide now how to end it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}精灵的时代已经过去，我们的族民迁徙至别处\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The time of the Elves is over. My people are leaving these shores.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们走了，你们要向谁求救。矮人吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Who will you look to when we've gone? The Dwarves?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们都躲在山洞挖宝藏，丝毫不关心别人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They hide in mountains seeking riches. They care not for the troubles of others.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}人类承载着我们的希望\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It is in Men that we must place our hope.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}人类？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Men?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}人类太脆弱，他们没有希望了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Men are weak. The race of Men is failing.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}努曼诺尔人的血液不再纯正，他们的骄傲与荣誉消失殆尽\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The blood of Numenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}魔戒遗留至今完全是人类的过错\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It is because of Men the Ring survives.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}当时我就在场，甘道夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I was there, Gandalf.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}三千年前\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I was there 3000 years ago,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}埃西铎夺走了至尊魔戒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	when Isildur took the Ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}人类屈服于诱惑的那天，我也在场\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I was there the day the strength of Men failed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}埃西铎，快，跟我来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Isildur, hurry! Follow me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我带埃西铎来到末日火山\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}只有在那里，魔戒才能被彻底摧毁\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	where the Ring was forged, the one place it could be destroyed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}快把它扔下去！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Cast it into the fire!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-快毁了它！  -不\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Destroy it!  -No.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}埃西铎！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Isildur!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那天就该终结的邪恶，却残留至今\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}埃西铎被魔戒害死，皇室血脉也就此断绝\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Isildur kept the Ring. The line of kings is broken.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}人类世界早已失去力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's no strength left in the world of Men.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-他们群龙无首，四处流浪  -还有一个人能让他们团结\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-They're scattered, divided, leaderless.  -There is one who could unite them.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}还有一个人能继承刚铎王位\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但他早就放弃王位了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He turned from that path a Long time ago.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他选择自我放逐\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He has chosen exile.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你不是精灵\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You are no EIf.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我是南方来的游侠\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Men of the South are welcome here.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-你是谁？  -我是灰袍巫师甘道夫的朋友\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Who are you?  -I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那我们是为了共同的目的来到此地\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Then we are here on common purpose,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}朋友\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	friend.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}纳希尔圣剑的碎片\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The shards of Narsil.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}就是这把利刃斩断了索伦的手掌\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}它锋利依旧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's still sharp.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但现在却只是残破的宝物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But no more than a broken heirloom.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你为什么惧怕过去？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Why do you fear the past?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}虽然你是埃西铎的后代，但却不是埃西铎本人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himseIf.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你不会重蹈他的覆辙\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You are not bound to his fate.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我跟他流着一样的血\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The same blood flows in my veins.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一样的软弱\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The same weakness.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你的时代即将来临\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Your time will come.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你会面对同样的邪恶，然后击败它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You will face the same evil. And you will defeat it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}邪恶的力量并没有征服一切\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The power of evil and not conquer us.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}至少你我还没被征服\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not over you, not over me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你还记得我们初次相识的场景吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do you remember the first time we have met?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我以为我走进了一个梦境\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I thought I had strayed into a dream.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}过了这么多年\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Long years have passed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你不再年少轻狂\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Had you not now concerns.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你还记得我当初许下了什么诺言吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Renech i beth i pennen?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你说你愿意嫁给我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You said you'd bind yourself to me,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}放弃精灵永生不死的力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	forsaking the immortal life of your people.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我仍愿意这么做\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And to that I hold.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我宁愿和你共度一生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I would rather share one lifetime with you
	{\3c&H6C3300&}也不愿意面对永生不死的孤寂\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	than face all the Ages of this world alone.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我选择成为凡人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I choose a mortal Life.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-你不能给我这个  -这是我的选择\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-You cannot give me this.  -It is mine to give to whom I will.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}它代表我的心\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Like my heart.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}来自远方的陌生人，老朋友\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Strangers from distant lands, friends of old,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你们被召集来商量该如何对抗魔多的威胁\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	you've been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}中土世界正面临灭亡的命运，无人能幸免\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你们不团结一心，就会遭到毁灭\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You will unite, or you will fall.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}所有的种族都无法幸免\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多，把魔戒拿来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}预言果然是真的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So it is true.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}在梦中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	In a dream,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我看到东方的天空一片昏暗\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I saw the eastern sky grow dark,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但西方仍有一丝微光\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	but in the West a pale light lingered.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一个声音轻唤着\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A voice was crying.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你即将面临灭亡的命运\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Your doom is near at hand.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}埃西铎灾星再现人世\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Isildur's Bane is found.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}埃西铎的灾星\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Isildur Bane.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}波罗莫！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Boromir！
	{\3c&H6C3300&}在伊姆拉崔，从未有人胆敢使用邪恶的语言\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Never before has any voice uttered the words of that tongue here in Imladris.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我不敢请您谅解，爱隆王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}然而魔多的邪恶语言\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	for the Black Speech of Mordor,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}可能很快就会\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	may yet be heard
	{\3c&H6C3300&}响彻西方世界的每个角落\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	in every corner of the West!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}至尊魔戒是彻头彻尾的邪恶之物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Ring is altogether evil.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这是一项礼物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It is a gift.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一项对抗魔多的厚礼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A gift to the foes of Mordor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们为什么不能利用这枚戒指？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Why not use this Ring?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我的父亲，崇高的刚铎的摄政王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}长久以来拒敌于河岸之外，用人民的鲜血\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	kept the forces of Mordor at bay. By the blood of our people
	{\3c&H6C3300&}保卫着你们的安全\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	are your lands kept safe.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}把敌人的武器交给刚铎，让我们利用它来对抗邪恶\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy. Let us use it against him.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你无法驾驭它，谁都不能\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You cannot wield it. None of us can.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}至尊魔戒只属于索伦，它没有第二个主人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The One Ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}区区一个游侠能懂什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And what would a Ranger know of this matter?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他不是普通的游侠\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This is no mere Ranger.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他是阿拉贡，阿拉桑之子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你必须效忠于他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You owe him your allegiance.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}阿拉贡\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Aragorn.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这位就是埃西铎的后代\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This is Isildur heir?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}也就是刚铎的王位继承人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And heir to the throne of Gondor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}坐下来，莱格拉斯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Havo dad, Legolas.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}刚铎没有国王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gondor has no king.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}刚铎也不需要国王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gondor needs no king.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}阿拉贡说得对，魔戒不能被利用\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你们只有一个选择\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You have only one choice.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}至尊魔戒一定要摧毁\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Ring must be destroyed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那我们还等什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What are we waiting for?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}魔戒不可能在这儿被摧毁，吉姆利，格洛因之子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这里的所有武器都无法摧毁它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	by any craft that we here possess.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}魔戒由末日火山的烈焰铸成\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}也只有在那儿才能摧毁它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Only there can it be unmade.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一定要深入魔多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It must be taken deep into Mordor
	{\3c&H6C3300&}把魔戒扔到末日火山的烈焰中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你们其中一个\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	One of you
	{\3c&H6C3300&}必须这么做\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	must do this.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们不能就这样闯进魔多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	One does not simply walk into Mordor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}除了有半兽人把守黑门\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Its Black Gates are guarded by more than just Orcs.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}还有永不松懈的邪恶力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There is evil there that does not sleep.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}索伦的邪眼更是虎视耽耽\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Great Eye is ever-watchful.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那是一片死寂的荒原\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It is a barren wasteland,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}布满烈焰，灰烬和尘埃\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	riddled with fire, and ash and dust.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}光是空中就充满着致命的毒气\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这不可能办到，即使千军万马也不可能\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not with 10,000 men could you do this. It is folly.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你没有听到爱隆王说的话吗？魔戒一定要被摧毁\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The Ring must be destroyed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}所以你就像自告奋勇吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}如果失败了怎么办，如果魔戒被索伦抢回去怎么办？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And if we fail, what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我绝不容许魔戒落入精灵手中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an EIf!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}精灵都不可靠！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Never trust an Elf!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你们还不懂吗？你们在这里争论不休的时候，索伦的力量正与日俱增\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do you not understand? While you bicker amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}没有人能避开厄运，所有人都会灭亡！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	None can escape it! You'll all be destroyed!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我愿意\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I will take it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我愿意\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I will take it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我愿意把魔戒带到魔多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I will take the Ring to Mordor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}虽然\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Though,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我不知道怎么去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I do not know the way.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我愿意帮助你，弗罗多巴金斯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}只要你愿意背负起这份重担\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	as Long as it is yours to bear.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我会用我的生命来保卫你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If by my life or death I can protect you,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我愿意\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I will.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我的剑会保护你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You have my sword.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}还有我的弓箭\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And you have my bow.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}还有我的战斧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And my ax.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你背负着大家的命运，小个子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You carry the fates of us all, Little one.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}如果这是大家的决定\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If this is indeed the will of the Council,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}刚铎也会鼎力支持\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	then Gondor will see it done.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-无论弗罗多去哪我也要跟着去  -拆散你们的确很难\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Frodo's not going anywhere without me.  -It is hardly possible to separate you,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}连没份参加的秘密会议你都来了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	even when he is summoned to a secret Council and you are not.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们也要跟着去！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We're coming too!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}除非你把我们五花大绑送回家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You'll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}总之，你需要聪明人参与才行，无论你怎么称呼它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Anyway, you need people of intelligence on this sort of
	{\3c&H6C3300&}任务也好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	mission.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}冒险也好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Quest.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}玩意儿也好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Thing.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你第一个就不合格，皮平\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Well, that rules you out, Pip.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}九名同伴\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Nine companions.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}就这样吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So be it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你们是魔戒远征队\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}好极了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Great!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们要去哪儿？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Where are we going?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}她想护佑她的子嗣\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	She wanted to protect her child.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}她以为你在瑞文戴尔会很安全\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	She thought in Rivendell you would be safe.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你母亲在内心深处明白，你终其一生都会被追杀\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	In her heart, your mother knew you'd be hunted all your life.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这是你逃脱不了的命运\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That you'd never escape your fate.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}精灵能够重铸人皇的圣剑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The skill of the Elves can reforge the sword of kings,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}然而只有你才有力量驾驭它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	but only you have the power to wield it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我不想拥有那种力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I do not want that power.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我从来都不想要它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have never wanted it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你是王族血脉最后的传承，再没有别人了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You are the last of that bloodline. There is no other.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我的宝剑！刺丁\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My old sword! Sting.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}来，拿去，试试\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Here, take it. Take it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-好轻啊  -没错，精灵铸的，名不虚传\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-It's so light.  -Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}半兽人接近的时候，剑身就会发光\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The blade glows blue when Orcs are close.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这样一来，你就要格外小心\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And it's times like that, my lad, when you have to be extra careful.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这玩意儿更棒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Here's a pretty thing.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}秘银\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mithril.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}轻若鸿毛，韧如龙麟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}让我看看你穿上是什么样，快试试\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let me see you put it on. Come on.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我的老戒指\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My old ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我真的很想\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I should very much like
	{\3c&H6C3300&}再把它握在手中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	to hold it again, one last time.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我很抱歉把你卷进这件事，孩子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}很抱歉让你扛下这份重担\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我对这一切都感到很抱歉\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm sorry for everything.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}持戒者准备出发到末日火山\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Ring-bearer is setting out on the Quest of Mount Doom.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}与他一起出征的各位，不必许下任何诺言\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	On you who travel with him, no oath,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}也不受任何约定的束缚，你们随时都可以中断旅程\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	nor bond is laid to go further than you will.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}再会了，别忘了你们的使命\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Farewell. Hold to your purpose.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}愿精灵与人类\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	May the blessings of Elves and Men
	{\3c&H6C3300&}以及所有自由之民的祝福与你们同行\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and all Free Folk go with you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}远征队等待持戒者启程\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}去魔多，甘道夫，是往左还是往右？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}往左\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Left.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们向迷雾山脉以西走四十天\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We must hold to this course, west of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}幸运的话，就能赶到洛汗隘口\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}再从那儿往东走到魔多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	From there, our road turns east to Mordor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}二，一，五。好，非常好！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Two, one, five. Good! Very good!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}脚步要快\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Move your feet.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-真棒，皮平  -谢谢\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-You look good, Pippin.  -Thanks.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}再快一点！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Faster!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}虽然你们都不问我的意见\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note they're not,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我还是要说我们在绕远路\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}甘道夫，我们可以穿过摩瑞亚矿坑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gandalf, we could pass through the Mines of Moria.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我表哥巴林一定会热烈的欢迎我们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不行，吉姆利，别无选择才能走摩瑞亚矿坑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No, I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}对不起\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sorry!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}绊倒他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Get him!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-夏尔万岁！  -把他压住，压住他，梅里！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-For the Shire!  -Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}好了，各位\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gentlemen, that's enough.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你抓住我了，你抓住我了！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You've got my arm! You've got my arm!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-那是什么？  -没什么，只是一朵乌云\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-What is that?  -Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}它移动的很快\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's moving fast.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}还迎着风\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Against the wind.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-是登兰德的乌鸦！  -快躲起来！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Crebain from Dunland!  -Hide!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-快点！  -快躲起来！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Hurry!  -Take cover!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}萨鲁曼的眼线\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Spies of Saruman.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}南方的路受到监视\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The passage south is being watched.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们一定要攀越卡兰拉斯山\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We must take the Pass of Caradhras.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}波罗莫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Boromir.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们受尽了恐惧和疑虑的折磨\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt
	{\3c&H6C3300&}就为了这小玩意儿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	over so small a thing.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这小小的玩意儿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Such a little thing.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}波罗莫！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Boromir!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}把魔戒还给弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Give the Ring to Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}遵命\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	As you wish.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我才不要它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I care not.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}甘道夫，你想带领他们越过卡兰拉斯山\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}要是失败，你还能去哪儿？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And if that fails, where then will you go?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}要是你被这崇山峻岭打败\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If the mountain defeats you,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你肯冒更大的风险吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	will you risk a more dangerous road?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}空气中有可怕的声音！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那是萨鲁曼！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's Saruman!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他想造成山崩，我们一定要回头，甘道夫！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's trying to bring down the mountain! Gandalf, we must turn back!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不行！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们一定要下山！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We must get off the mountain!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}赶到洛汗隘口，从西边走到我的城市！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Make for the Gap of Rohan, and take the west road to my city!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}洛汗隘口离艾辛格太近了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}上面走不成，就走下面吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We cannot pass over a mountain. Let us go under it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}让我们穿过摩瑞亚矿坑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let us go through the Mines of Moria.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}摩瑞亚，你很怕穿过矿坑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Moria. You fear to go into those mines.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}矮人太贪心，挖的太深\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你知道他们在卡萨杜姆的黑暗中唤醒了什么\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad-dum,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}邪恶的炎魔\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Shadow and flame.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}让魔戒持有者决定\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let the Ring-bearer decide.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们不能再留在这儿了！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We cannot stay here!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}霍比特人会死在这儿的！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This will be the death of the Hobbits!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们就走矿坑吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We will go through the mines.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}就这样吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So be it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多，过来帮帮我这个老头子吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo, come and help an old man.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你的肩膀还好吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	How is your shoulders?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-比之前好多了  -魔戒呢？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Better than it was.  -And the Ring?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你感觉到那股力量越来越强大了，对不对？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You feel its power growing, don't you?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我也感觉到了。你一定要小心\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I've felt it too. You must be careful now.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}邪恶不仅仅来源于远征队之外\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Evil will be drawn to you from outside the Fellowship.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}恐怕也会来自于远征队内部\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And, I fear, from within.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我该相信谁？  -你一定要相信你自己\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Who then do I trust?  -You must trust yourself.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}相信你本身的力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Trust your own strengths.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-什么意思？  -这世界有许多不同的力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-What do you mean?  -There are many powers in this world,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}或善或恶\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	for good or for evil.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}其中的一些比我的力量还强大\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Some are greater than I am.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}有些我也从未遭遇过\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And against some I have not yet been tested.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}摩瑞亚的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The walls
	{\3c&H6C3300&}巨墙\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	of Moria.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}矮人大门关闭的时候是隐形的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}对，吉姆利，如果忘记了谜语，连主人自己都找不到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find them if their secrets are forgotten.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我为什么一点儿也不觉得惊讶？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Why doesn't that surprise me?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}让我看看\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Well, let's see.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}伊希尔丁金属\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Ithildin.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}它只反射星光和月光\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}上面写着，杜林之门，摩瑞亚之主\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It reads, The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-开口说，朋友，然后进入  -那是什么意思？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Speak, friend, and enter.  -What do you suppose that means?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}很简单，如果是朋友，说出暗语门就开了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}没有动静\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Nothing's happening.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我曾经很熟悉精灵，人类甚至是半兽人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}所有语言中的咒语\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Men and Orcs.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那你现在要怎么办？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What are you going to do, then?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}用你的脑袋把大门撞开，皮瑞格林·图克！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Knock your head against these doors, Peregrin Took!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}如果那样还没用的话\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And if that does not shatter them
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你就不要用这么蠢的问题来打扰我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我会想办法找出咒语的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I will try to find the opening words.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}马儿不能进入矿坑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mines are no place for a pony.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-就算像比尔一样勇敢也不行  -再见了，比尔\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Even one so brave as Bill.  -Bye-bye, Bill.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}去吧，比尔，去吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Go on, Bill. Go on.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}放心，山姆，它知道回家的路\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}别玩水\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do not disturb the water.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}噢，完全没用\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, it's useless.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这是一个谜语\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's a riddle.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}开口说"朋友"，然后进入\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Speak "friend" and enter.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}"朋友"用精灵语怎么说？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What's the Elvish word for "friend"?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}Mellon（精灵语）\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mellon.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}很快，精灵，你就能见识我们矮人族的热情\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}熊熊的火焰，清凉的啤酒，还有大块的烤肉\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}朋友，这里就是我表哥巴林的家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}就是他们所谓的矿坑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And they call it a mine.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一座巨大的矿坑！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A mine!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这根本不是矿坑，这是坟墓\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This is no mine. It's a tomb.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}地精\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Goblins.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们应该去洛汗隘口，我们根本就不该来这儿的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We make for the Gap of Rohan. We should never have come here.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}快走，快出去！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Now! get out of here. Get out!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-弗罗多！  -救救我！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Frodo!  -Help!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}神行客！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Strider!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-快救救我！  -放开他！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Help!  -Get off him!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}阿拉贡！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Aragorn!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}快进矿坑！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Into the mines!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-莱格拉斯！  -快进矿坑！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Legolas!  -Into the cave!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}快跑！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Run!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们现在只剩下一个选择了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We now have but one choice.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们一定要穿过黑暗的摩瑞亚矿坑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We must face the long dark of Moria.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}提高警觉\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Be on your guard.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}在这个黑暗的地底世界\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There are older and fouler things than Orcs
	{\3c&H6C3300&}有比半兽人更可怕的怪物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	in the deep places of the world.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}安静，要走四天才能到另一边\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Quietly now. It's a four-day journey to the other side.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}希望我们不会惊动什么\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}摩瑞亚的财富不在于金矿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The wealth of Moria was not in gold
	{\3c&H6C3300&}或珠宝\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	or jewels,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}而是秘银\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	but mithril.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}比尔博有一件秘银罩衫，是索林送给他的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-噢，那可是极其尊贵的礼物  -的确如此\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Oh, that was a kingly gift.  -Yes.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我从来没跟他说过\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I never told him,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那件衣服足以买下整个夏尔\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	but its worth was greater than the value of the Shire.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}皮平\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Pippin.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我不记得这地方\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have no memory of this place.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我们迷路了吗？  -不是\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Are we lost?  -No.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我想我们是迷路了  -甘道夫正在想呢\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-I think we are.  -Gandalf's thinking.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-梅里  -干嘛？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Merry?  -What?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我饿了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm hungry.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-下面有动静  -那是咕噜\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-There's something down there.  -It's Gollum.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-咕噜？  -他跟了我们三天了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Gollum?  -He's been following us for three days.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-他从巴拉多的地牢逃出来了？  -逃出来？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dur?  -Escaped,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}或是被放出来的吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	or was set loose.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}现在魔戒吸引他到这儿来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Now the Ring has brought him here.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他永远渴望拥有魔戒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He will never be rid of his need for it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他对魔戒又爱又恨，就像他对自己爱恨交加\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}斯美戈的一生是很悲惨的故事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Smeagol's life is a sad story.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}是的，在魔戒引诱他之前，他叫斯美戈\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes, Smeagol he was once called. Before the Ring found him.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}在魔戒让他发狂之前\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Before it drove him mad.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}可惜比尔博当时有机会却没杀了他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}可惜？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Pity?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}比尔博是可怜他才没杀他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}有很多活人本来就该死，也有些死人命不该绝\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你能做这种判断吗，弗罗多？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Can you give it to them, Frodo?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}千万别轻易断定别人的生死\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}就连智者都无法决定命运\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Even the very wise cannot see all ends.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我直觉地认为不管是好是坏，咕噜都会跟这趟探险有关\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}在这一切结束前\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	before this is over.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}比尔博的同情心影响了很多人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我真希望魔戒没在我手中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I wish the Ring had never come to me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我真希望这一切都没发生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I wish none of this had happened.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}每个人遇到难关都会这么想，但是我们却无法决定自己的命运\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们要决定的是在苦难中该如何选择\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多，世上除了邪恶以外还有别的力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}比尔博注定要找到魔戒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你也注定要得到它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	In which case, you also were meant to have it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}能这么想就好了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And that is an encouraging thought.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}是这个方向\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's that way.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-他记起来了  -没有\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-He's remembered.  -No.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但这儿的空气没那么糟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But the air doesn't smell so foul down here.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}梅利阿道克，要是迷了路，跟着鼻子走就对了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}让我冒点险再弄亮一点\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let me risk a little more light.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}看吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Behold,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这就是宏伟的矮人故乡摩瑞亚\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	the great realm and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}真是令人大开眼界\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's an eye opener, and no mistake.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}吉姆利！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gimli!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No!

	Oh, no.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No.

	son of Fundin,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}摩瑞亚之王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Lord of Moria.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他死了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He is dead, then.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}果然和我担心的一样\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's as I feared.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们快走吧，别在这儿逗留\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We must move on. We cannot linger.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们攻下桥梁和第二大厅\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They have taken the bridge and the second hall.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们拴住大门\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We have barred the gates,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}却阻挡不了他们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	but cannot hold them for long.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}大地在撼动\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The ground shakes.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}鼓声\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Drums,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}地底深处传来鼓声\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	drums in the deep.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们逃不出去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We cannot get out.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}黑暗中有一个阴影\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A Shadow moves in the dark.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们逃不出去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We cannot get out.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们来了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They are coming.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你这个蠢小子！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Fool of a Took!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}下次你自己也跳下去算了，免得我们都被你给害死\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity.

	Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们有一只食人妖\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They have a cave-troll.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}让他们来受死吧！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let them come!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}摩瑞亚还有最后一个矮人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There is one Dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我越来越厉害了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I think I'm getting the hang of this.

	He's alive.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我没事，我没受伤\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm all right. I'm not hurt.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你应该没命的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You should be dead.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那一剑连野猪都能刺穿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That spear would have skewered a wild boar.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}小霍比特人远远比我们想象的厉害\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I think there's more to this Hobbit than meets the eye.

	{\3c&H6C3300&}我有老鹰的眼睛，狐狸的耳朵\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这矮子太聒噪 ，就算闭着眼睛也能毙了他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	Speak words we can all understand!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}从黑暗时代起我们就再没有和矮人打过交道\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	{\3c&H6C3300&}你知道矮人会怎么说吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And you know what this Dwarf says to that?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那很没有礼貌\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That was not so courteous.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你带来了强大的邪恶力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You bring great evil with you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你们不能再继续前行\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You can go no further.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}甘道夫不能白白牺牲\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	{\3c&H6C3300&}我从远方就看不到他了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	For we went needlessly into the net of Moria.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}甘道夫一生都不会冒不必要的风险\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们还无法知悉他的用意为何\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We do not yet know his full purpose.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不要让卡萨督姆的悲伤使你们垂头丧气\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do not let the great emptiness of Khazad-dum fill your heart.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}吉姆利，格洛因之子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gimli, son of Gloin.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这世界充满凶险\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	For the world has grown full of peril
	{\3c&H6C3300&}到处都是困难重重\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and in all lands,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你们心中充满着悲伤\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	love is now mingled with grief.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}魔戒远征队将何去何从？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What now becomes of this Fellowship?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}没有甘道夫，他们毫无希望\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Without Gandalf, hope is lost.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这趟旅程险象环生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}只要稍加疏忽就会彻底失败\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Stray but a little and it will fail
	{\3c&H6C3300&}世界也终将毁灭\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	to the ruin of all.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}然而只要你们精诚一致就有希望\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yet hope remains while the Company is true.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}别动摇内心的坚定，快去休息吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go now and rest
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你们有太多的哀伤和疲惫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}今晚，你们将会安眠\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Tonight, you will sleep.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}欢迎，夏尔的弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Welcome, Frodo of the Shire,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}只有你一人见过邪眼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	one who has seen the Eye!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们在为甘道夫唱挽歌\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A lament for Gandalf.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}歌词里都说了些什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What do they say about him?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我不忍心告诉你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have not the heart to tell you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我的伤痛尚未愈合\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	For me, the grief is still too near.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们一定没提到甘道夫的焰火\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I bet they don't mention his fireworks.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们应该作诗来歌颂这一点\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There should be a verse about them.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}举世无匹最绚烂的焰火\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The finest rockets ever seen.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}在空中闪烁就像耀眼的星斗\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They burst in stars of blue and green.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}华丽宛如漫天之星辰\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Or after thunder, silver showers.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}散落如同缤纷的花雨\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Came falling like a rain of flowers.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这都无法形容这焰火有多壮观\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}休息吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Take some rest.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这里很安全\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	These borders are well-protected.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我在这里无法入眠\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I will find no rest here.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我听到她的声音\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I heard her voice inside my head.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}她提到我祖辈和刚铎覆亡的命运\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}她说，现在仍有一线希望\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	She said to me, "even now there is hope left."
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是我却看不到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But I cannot see it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们长久以来都毫无希望可言\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It is long since we had any hope.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我父亲拥有高贵的情操\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My father is a noble man.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但他无法统治刚铎\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But his rule is failing
	{\3c&H6C3300&}人民也失去信心\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and our people lose faith.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他希望我能成功，我也希望\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He looks to me to make things right, and I would do it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我想要重建刚铎的荣耀\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I would see the glory of Gondor restored.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你曾经见过吗？阿拉贡\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}爱克西里昂的白塔\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The White Tower of Ecthelion.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}像珍珠和白银一般闪闪发亮\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}塔上的旗帜随风飘扬\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Its banners caught high in the morning breeze.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你有没有听过\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Have you ever been called home
	{\3c&H6C3300&}银色号角响亮的召唤声？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}圣白城\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have seen the White City
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我很久以前曾经去过\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	long ago.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}有一天，我们会一起去那儿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	One day, our paths will lead us there.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}护城的守卫将高喊\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And the tower guard shall take up the call,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}刚铎之主回来了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	"The Lords of Gondor have returned."
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你想看看镜子么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Will you look into the mirror?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我会看到什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What will I see?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}即使最聪明的智者也不能断言\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Even the wisest cannot tell.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}因为镜子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	For the mirror
	{\3c&H6C3300&}能显现各种事情\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	shows many things.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}过去的事情\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Things that were,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}现在的事情\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	things that are,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}还有一些\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and some things
	{\3c&H6C3300&}尚未发生的事情\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	that have not yet come to pass.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我知道你看到什么\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I know what it is you saw.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那一幕也在我心中呈现\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	For it is also in my mind.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}如果你失败就会发生这些事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It is what will come to pass if you should fail.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}魔戒远征队已经开始四分五裂\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Fellowship is breaking. It is already begun.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他会试图抢走魔戒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He will try to take the Ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你知道我说的是谁\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You know of whom I speak.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们会一一被魔戒击垮\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	One by one, it will destroy them all.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你要的话\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If you ask it of me,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我就把至尊魔戒给你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I will give you the One Ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你肯毫无条件的把它给我？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You offer it to me freely？
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我承认我很想要魔戒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我将成为魔戒之后\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	In place of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}并不黑暗而无比的美丽，像初生的曙光一样耀眼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	not dark but beautiful, and terrible as the dawn!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}跟海洋一样高深莫测\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Treacherous as the sea!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}远比大地更加深厚\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Stronger than the foundations of the earth!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}世人都将绝望的爱我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	All shall love me
	{\3c&H6C3300&}而且自暴自弃\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and despair.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我通过了试炼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I pass the test.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我会退隐到西方\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I will diminish and go into the West
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-继续当凯兰崔尔女王  -我一个人无法摧毁它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-and remain Galadriel.  -I cannot do this alone.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你是魔戒持有者，弗罗多，持有至尊魔戒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear a Ring of Power
	{\3c&H6C3300&}就必须孤单一个人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	is to be alone.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这是钻石魔戒南雅\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我是它的持有者\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And I am its keeper.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这是注定属于你的命运\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This task was appointed to you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}如果你办不到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And if you do not find a way,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}任何人都无法办到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	no one will.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我知道该怎么做了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Then I know what I must do.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}只是\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's just.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我感到害怕\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm afraid to do it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}即便再渺小的人也能够改变未来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你知道半兽人是怎么来的吗\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do you know how the Orcs first came into being?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们曾经是精灵\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They were Elves once.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是却被黑暗的力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Taken by the Dark Powers
	{\3c&H6C3300&}折磨到不成人形\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	tortured and mutilated.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们是被扭曲的可怕生物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A ruined and terrible form of life.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}现在，却在我的手中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And now
	{\3c&H6C3300&}达到完美境界\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	perfected.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我的强兽人战士\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My fighting Uruk-hai,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你的主人是谁？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	whom do you serve?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}萨鲁曼！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Saruman!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}猎杀他们，找不到他们绝不罢手\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hunt them down. Do not stop until, they are found.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你们没有痛苦，也没有恐惧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You do not know pain. You do not know fear.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你们只会杀人！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You will taste Man-flesh!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}有一个半身人携带着价值连城的东西\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	One of the halflings carries something of great value.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我要毫发无损的抓到他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}杀了其他人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Kill the others.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们从未让外人穿戴上我们的衣裳\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}希望披风能保护你们不受邪眼侵扰\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	May these cloaks help shield you from unfriendly eyes.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}兰巴斯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Lembas.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}精灵的行路面包\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Elvish waybread.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一小口就可以填饱一个成人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	One small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你吃了多少？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	How many did you eat?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}四个\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Four.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}每往南方前进一步，危险就增加一分\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Every league you travel south, the danger will increase.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}魔多的半兽人已经占领了安都因河岸\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore of the Anduin.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}西岸也不再安全\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Nor will you find safety on the western bank.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}萨鲁曼的白掌部队曾在我们的边界出没\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Strange creatures bearing the White Hand have been seen on our borders.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一般的半兽人不能在烈日下行动，但这些怪物却可以\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Seldom do Orcs journey in the open under the sun, yet these have done so.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们正在猎杀你们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You are being tracked.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}只有从水路走你们才有机会赶在敌人之前到达拉洛斯瀑布\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	By river you have the chance of outrunning the enemy to the Falls of Rauros.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我给你的礼物，莱格拉斯，是凯兰崔姆神弓\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}它能让你拥有百步穿杨的绝技\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这是诺多精灵的匕首\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	These are the daggers of the Noldorin.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}曾在战场上杀敌无数\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They have already seen service in war.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不要恐惧，皮瑞格林·图克\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你会找到你的勇气\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You will find your courage.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}而给你的礼物，山姆卫斯·甘吉\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And for you, Samwise Gamgee,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}是用希斯蓝精灵绳索\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Elven rope made of hithlain.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}谢谢您，女王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Thank you, my lady.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这些匕首还有多的吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}矮人想从精灵这边要什么样的礼物？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And what gift would a dwarf ask of the Elves?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}什么也不要\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Nothing.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}只求能再看一眼凯兰崔姆女王的容颜\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Except to look upon the lady of the Galadhrim one last time,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}她的美貌比地底所有的珍宝美钻都更加摄人魂魄\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	for she is more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}其实\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Actually,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}有一项东西\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	there was one thing.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不过，我不敢奢想，这是不可能的礼物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No, no, I couIdn't. It's quite impossible.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我也不该开口\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Stupid to ask.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我不能再给你任何的东西\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have nothing greater to give
	{\3c&H6C3300&}因为你已经拥有了最珍贵的礼物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	than the gift you already bear.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}亚玟的爱\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	For her love,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是我怕亚玟会越来越虚弱\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar will diminish.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我会要她远离中土世界\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I would have her leave these shores,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}和她的族人住在一起\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and be with her people.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我会要她乘船到瓦林诺\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I would have her take the ship to Valinor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}她会做出她的选择\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That choice is yet before her.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你自己也有抉择要做，阿拉贡\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}重建伊伦迪尔时代以来你父辈的辉煌成就\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	To rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of EIendil,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}或是跟着你最后的族人坠入绝望的深渊\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}再会\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Farewell.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你的力量远远不止于此\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There is much you have yet to do.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但我们不会再见面了，伊力萨王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We shall not meet again, Elessar.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}再见了，弗罗多·巴金斯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Farewell, Frodo Baggins.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我将埃兰迪尔之光赠予你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I give you the light of Earendil,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}她是我们最挚爱的星辰\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	our most beloved star.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}愿它在所有光亮黯淡之时\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	May it be a light for you in dark places,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}在黑暗中为你照亮光明\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	when all other lights go out.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}再不会有更加哀伤的离别了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have taken my worst wound at this parting
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这是我最后一眼见世界上最美丽的容颜\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	having looked my last upon that which is fairest.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}从此之后，所有的东西都不会比她给予的礼物更加的美丽\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Henceforth I will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}她给你的礼物是什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What was her gift?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我跟她要一根她的金发\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I asked her for one hair from her golden head.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}她给了我三根\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	She gave me three.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}是咕噜，他从摩瑞亚开始就一直跟着我们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我还以为在河上就能甩掉他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I had hoped we would lose him on the river.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}没想到他水性这么好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But he's too clever a waterman.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}如果他让敌人知道我们现在在哪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们渡河就更危险了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	it will make the crossing even more dangerous.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}吃点东西吧，弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Have some food, Mr. Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-不了，山姆  -你一整天都没吃东西\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-No, Sam.  -You haven't eaten anything all day.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你也睡不着，不要以为我没有注意到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You're not sleeping, neither. Don't think I haven't noticed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-弗罗多先生  -我很好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Mr. Frodo.  -I'm all right.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是你不好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But you're not.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我是来帮助你的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm here to help you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我跟甘道夫保证过我会帮助你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I promised Gandalf that I would.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你帮不上忙的，山姆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You can't help me, Sam.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}这次帮不上\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not this time.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}睡一会儿吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Get some sleep.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}米纳斯提里斯比较安全\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Minas Tirith is the safer road.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你知道的，那里我们可以重整力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You know that. From there we can regroup.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}然后再一鼓作气攻向魔多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}刚铎无法帮助我们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你倒是很容易就相信了精灵\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You were quick enough to trust the Elves.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你对你的子民就这么没有信心嘛？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Have you so little faith in your own people?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}对，他们的力量很薄弱，意志也不够坚定\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes, there is weakness. There is frailty.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是人类拥有无比的勇气和高贵的情操\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But there is courage also, and honor to be found in Men.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是你却无视这一点\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But you will not see that.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你很恐惧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You are afraid!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你这一辈子都躲在阴影下\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}拒绝承认自己的身份\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Scared of who you are, of what you are.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我绝不会把魔戒带到你的城市\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I will not lead the Ring within a hundred leagues of your city.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}亚苟纳斯巨像\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Argonath.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我一直都想仰望过往伟大君王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我的父辈们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My kin.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}天一黑就过湖\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We cross the lake at nightfall.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}把船藏好再改用步行\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hide the boats and continue on foot.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我们从北面进入魔多  -哦，是吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-We approach Mordor from the North.  -Oh, yes?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那就仅仅是通过艾明莫尔而已喽？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那是充满尖石的迷宫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	An impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}然后呢，就更精彩了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And after that, it gets even better.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那儿有一望无际的臭沼泽地\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Festering, stinking marshland as far as the eye can see.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}那就是我们要走的路\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That is our road.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我建议你好好休息，养精蓄锐，矮人先生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}养精蓄锐个头\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Recover my.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我们最好马上启程  -不行\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-We should leave now.  -No.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}半兽人在巡逻东岸，一定要等到天黑再出发\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我担心的不是东岸\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It is not the eastern shore that worries me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我心中一直有一个阴影，一个逐步靠近的威胁\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}危险正在逼近，我感觉得到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Something draws near. I can feel it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}矮人族精力旺盛吃苦耐劳，别理他，小霍比特人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Recover strength? Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多呢？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Where's Frodo?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们都不该一个人乱跑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	None of us should wander alone.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}尤其是你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You, least of all.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你责任重大\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So much depends on you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我知道你想一个人静一静\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I know why you seek solitude.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}日复一日的，我看着你默默的承受\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You suffer. I see it day by day.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你确定你不是白白受苦吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You sure you do not suffer needlessly?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}还有其他的路，弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There are other ways, Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我们可以尝试别的选择  -我知道你想说什么\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Other paths that we might take.  -I know what you would say.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}看似很有道理，但我已得到警告\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It would seem like wisdom, but for the warning in my heart.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}警告？警告什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Warning? Against what?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们都一样恐惧，弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We're all afraid, Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但如果让恐惧恣意肆虐，毁灭一切希望\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But to let that fear drive us, to destroy what hope we have,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-未免太荒谬了吧  -没有别的路可走\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-don't you see that is madness?  -There is no other way.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我仅仅只想要捍卫我人民的力量！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I ask only for the strength to defend my people!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-把魔戒借我  -不行\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-If you would but lend me the Ring.  -No.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-你为何退缩，我又不是强盗  -你失去理智了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Why do you recoil? I am no thief.  -You are not yourself.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你以为你能成功吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What chance do you think you have?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们会找到你，他们会把魔戒抢走\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They will find you. They will take the Ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}让你求生不得，求死不能\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And you will beg for death before the end!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你这个傻子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You fool!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你只是靠运气才得到它，它应该是我的，快给我！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It is not yours, save by unhappy chance! It could have been mine!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}它应该是我的！给我！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It should be mine! Give it to me!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-快给我！  -不！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Give it to me!  -No!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-给我！  -不！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Give it to me!  -No!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我知道了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I see your mind.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你会把魔戒给索伦！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You will take the Ring to Sauron!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你会背叛我们！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You will betray us!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你会害我们跟你一起死！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You'll go to your death, and the death of us all!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我诅咒你！我诅咒所有的半身人！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Curse you! Curse you and all the halflings!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我做了什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What have I done?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}求求你，弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Please, Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多，对不起！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo, I'm sorry!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-它蛊惑了波罗莫  -魔戒呢？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-It has taken Boromir.  -Where is the Ring?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}别过来！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Stay away!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我发誓过要保护你  -你能保证不害我吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-I swore to protect you.  -Can you protect me from yourself?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你会坚持摧毁它吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Would you destroy it?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}亚拉冈\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Aragorn.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}亚拉冈\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Aragorn.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}伊力萨王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Elessar.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我愿意跟随你到最后\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I would have gone with you to the end.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}跟随你到魔多烈焰\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Into the very fires of Mordor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我明白了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I know.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}好好照顾他们，尤其是山姆，他不会理解的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Look after the others. Especially Sam. He will not understand.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}快跑，弗罗多！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Go, Frodo!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}快跑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Run.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}快跑呀！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Run!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多先生！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mr. Frodo!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}去找半身人！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Find the halfling!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}去找半身人！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Find the halfling!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}伊兰迪尔！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Elendil!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}阿拉贡，快走！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Aragorn, go!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}躲过来，快点！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hide here. Quick!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}快点！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come on!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他在干嘛？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What's he doing?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他要离开了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's leaving.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-不！  -皮平！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-No!  -Pippin!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}快跑吧，弗罗多，快跑！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Run, Frodo. Go on!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-嘿，你们几个！  -看这儿！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Hey, you!  -Over here!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-这里！  -这边！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Over here!  -This way!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-成功了！  -我知道成功了，快跑！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-It's working!  -I know it's working! Run!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-刚铎的号角  -是波罗莫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-The horn of Gondor.  -Boromir.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}快跑！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Run!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-他们把霍比特人抓走了  -别动\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-They took the little ones.  -Hold still.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多，弗罗多在哪里？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo. Where is Frodo?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我让他走了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I let Frodo go.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你做到我做不到的事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Then you did what I could not.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我想要抢走魔戒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I tried to take the Ring from him.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-现在谁也抢不走魔戒了  -原谅我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-The Ring is beyond our reach now.  -Forgive me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我没想到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I did not see it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我让大家失望了  -不，波罗莫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-I have failed you all.  -No, Boromir.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你英勇的战斗\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You fought bravely.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}捍卫了你的尊严\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You have kept your honor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}算了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Leave it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}一切都结束了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It is over.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}人类世界将会灭亡，黑暗将会笼罩大地\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The world of Men will fall. And all will come to darkness
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我的城市也将遭到毁灭\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and my city to ruin.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我不知道我有多大的力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I do not know what strength is in my blood,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但我发誓，我绝不会让白城沦陷\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	but I swear to you, I will not let the White City fall,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}也不会让我们的人民受苦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	nor our people fail.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们的人民\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Our people.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们的人民\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Our people.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我愿跟随你，我的好兄弟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I would have followed you, my brother.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我的领袖\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My captain.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我的国王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My king.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}安息吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Be at peace,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}刚铎之子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	son of Gondor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}他们会盼望他重回白塔\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They will look for his coming from the White Tower.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但是他却永远也回不去了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But he will not return.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我真希望魔戒没在我手中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I wish the Ring had never come to me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我真希望这一切都没发生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I wish none of this had happened.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}每个人遇到难关都会这么想\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So do all who live to see such times,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但我们无法决定自己的命运\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	but that is not for them to decide.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你所能决定的只是\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	All you have to decide
	{\3c&H6C3300&}在这段时间内该如何去做\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	is what to do with the time that is given to you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}不，弗罗多！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo, no!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	{\3c&H6C3300&}回去吧，山姆！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Go back, Sam!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-我要一个人去魔多  -没问题\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-I'm going to Mordor alone.  -Of course you are.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}但我要跟你一起去！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And I'm coming with you!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}你不会游泳！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You can't swim!

	Sam!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我许下一个承诺，弗罗多先生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}"永远别离开他，山姆卫斯·甘吉"\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A promise "don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."
	{\3c&H6C3300&}而我绝不离开你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And I don't mean to.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}绝对不会\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	Sam.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}来吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come on.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}快，弗罗多和山姆到东岸了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hurry! Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}-你不打算跟去  -我们帮不了弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-You mean not to follow them.  -Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们一切的努力都白费了，远征队也彻底失败\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Then it has all been in vain. The Fellowship has failed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们的努力不会白费\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not if we hold true to each other.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我们不能丢下梅里和皮平让他们受苦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}只要我们还有一丝力气。不用的都留下来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not while we have strength left. Leave all that can be spared behind.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}轻装上阵\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We travel light.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}让我们去猎杀半兽人吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let us hunt some Orc.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}好！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}魔多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mordor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}希望其他人走的路比较安全\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I hope the others find a safer road.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}神行客会照顾他们的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Strider will look after them.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}我想我们不会再见到他们了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}弗罗多，我们也许还会再见\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We may yet, Mr. Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}也许会\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We may.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}山姆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sam,

	I'm glad you are with me.

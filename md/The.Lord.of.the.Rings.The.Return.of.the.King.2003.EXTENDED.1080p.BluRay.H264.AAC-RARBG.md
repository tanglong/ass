	你身经百战，杀敌无数，希优顿王\N

	很快就会发动进攻\N
	His attack will come soon.
	你们全都难逃一死\N
	You're all going to die.
	但是你早就知道了，对吧，甘道夫？\N
	But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?
	你不会真以为这个游侠能坐上刚铎王位吧？\N
	You cannot think that this Ranger will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor?
	这个从阴影中爬出来的流亡者将永远不会成为国王\N
	This exile, crept from the shadows, will never be crowned king.
	甘道夫会毫不迟疑的牺牲他最亲近的朋友\N
	Gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those closest to him,
	那些他声称热爱的朋友\N

	跟他说了什么好话？\N
	before you sent him to his doom?
	你让他走上一条必死无疑的不归路\N

	下来吧\N
	Come down.
	洛汗子弟？\N
	A Man of Rohan?
	洛汗子弟算什么东西？\N
	What is the house of Rohan?
	你们不过是一群土匪，喝着肮脏的水，住在茅草屋里\N
	But a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek
	他们的小孩跟畜生一样在地上爬来爬去\N
	and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs?
	圣盔谷的胜利不属于你，骠骑国国王希优顿\N
	The victory at Helm's Deep does not belong to you, Theoden Horse-master.

	你们都是男子汉\N
	You are both honourable men.
	率领洛汗人打胜仗的并不是我希优顿王\N

	你不必听我发牢骚\N
	Don't listen to me.
	你还年轻\N

	他想摧毁米纳斯提里斯\N
	He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground
	阻止人类的王者再临\N
	before he sees a king return to the throne of Men.
	如果刚铎点燃烽火，洛汗必须准备参战\N
	If the beacons of Gondor are lit, Rohan must be ready for war.
	告诉我\N
	Tell me,
	他们没来帮助我们，我们凭什么要出兵援救？\N
	why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours?
	我们欠刚铎什么吗？\N
	What do we owe Gondor?
	-我去好了  -不行！\N
	-I will go.  -No!
	-一定要警告他们  -他们会受到警告\N
	-They must be warned.  -They will be.
	你要从另一条路去米纳斯提里斯\N
	You must come to Minas Tirith by another road.
	溯河而上，寻找黑色大船\N
	Follow the river. Look to the black ships.
	要明白\N
	Understand this.
	大战有如箭在弦上一触即发\N
	Things are now in motion that cannot be undone.
	我要去米纳斯提里斯\N
	I ride for Minas Tirith
	但我不会一个人去\N
	and I won't be going alone.
	皮瑞格林·图克，你这个爱管闲事的霍比特人\N
	Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst.
	快！快！\N
	Hurry! Hurry!
	我们要去哪儿？\N
	Where are we going?
	你为什么要乱看？\N
	Why did you look?
	你为什么总是那么喜欢乱看？\N
	Why do you always have to look?
	-不知道，我就是忍不住  -你总是忍不住\N
	-I don't know. I can't help it.  -You never can.
	对不起，行吗？\N
	I'm sorry, all right?
	-我下次不敢了  -你还不明白吗？\N
	-I won't do it again.  -Don't you understand?
	敌人以为魔戒在你手上\N
	The enemy thinks you have the Ring.
	他会来找你，皮平，他们一定要把你带走\N
	He's going to be looking for you, Pip. They have to get you out of here.
	那你呢？你会跟我一起走吧？\N
	And you? You're coming with me?
	梅里？\N
	Merry?
	走吧\N
	Come on.
	米纳斯提里斯有多远？\N
	How far is Minas Tirith?
	骑马要骑三天，戒灵都用飞的\N
	Three days' ride, as the Nazgul flies.
	你最好祈祷他们不会追上来\N
	And you better hope we don't have one of those on our tail.
	拿去\N
	Here.
	给你在路上抽\N
	Something for the road.
	最后一包长底烟草\N
	The last of the Longbottom Leaf.
	我知道你抽完了，你抽得太凶了，皮平\N
	I know you've run out. You smoke too much, Pippin.
	可是我们很快会再见面\N
	But we'll see each other soon.
	-对吧？  -我不知道\N
	-Won't we?  -I don't know.
	我不知道以后会发生什么\N
	I don't know what's going to happen.
	-梅里  -快跑，影疾\N
	-Merry.  -Run, Shadowfax.
	用最快的速度狂奔\N
	Show us the meaning of haste.
	梅里！\N
	Merry!
	梅里！\N
	Merry!
	从小时候开始\N
	He's always followed me,
	不管我去哪里\N
	everywhere I went,
	他都黏着我不放\N
	since before we were tweens.
	我总是害他惹上各种麻烦\N
	I would get him into the worst sort of trouble,
	可是我也一定会替他解围\N
	but I was always there to get him out.
	现在他不在了\N
	Now he's gone.
	就跟弗罗多和山姆一样\N
	Just like Frodo and Sam.
	我从霍比特人身上学到一件事\N
	One thing I have learned about Hobbits.
	他们都很坚强\N
	They're a most hardy folk.
	有时候也很傻，他可是图克家的子弟\N
	Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.
	带她走最安全的路\N
	Take her by the safest road.
	有一艘船停泊在灰港岸\N
	A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens.
	等着载她到海外仙境\N
	It waits to carry her across the sea.
	这是亚玟·安多米尔的最后之旅\N
	The last journey of Arwen Undomiel.
	你留在这儿什么都没有\N
	There is nothing for you here,
	只有死亡\N
	only death.
	亚玟公主\N
	Lady Arwen,
	不能再耽误时间了\N
	we cannot delay.
	公主！\N
	My lady!
	-告诉我你看到什么？  -亚玟\N
	-Tell me what you have seen?  -Arwen.
	你有预见未来的能力\N
	You have the gift of foresight.
	你看见什么？\N
	What did you see?
	我看见你的未来，你会死亡\N
	I looked into your future, and I saw death.
	但是也有新生\N
	But there is also life.
	你看见一个小孩，那是我的儿子\N
	You saw there was a child. You saw my son.
	这个未来可能无法成真\N
	That future is almost gone.
	但是仍有希望\N
	But it is not lost.
	你不能确定\N
	Nothing is certain.
	我只能确定一件事\N
	Some things are certain.
	如果我现在离开他\N
	If I leave him now,
	一定会终生悔恨\N
	I will regret it forever.
	是时候了\N
	It is time.
	花火将从灰烬中复燃\N
	From the ashes a fire shall be woken.
	光明将从暗影中再现\N
	A light from the shadow shall spring.
	断裂的圣剑将恢复原样\N
	Renewed shall be blade that was broken.
	失去王冠者将成为国王\N
	The crownless again shall be king.
	请你重铸圣剑\N
	Re-forge the sword.
	你的手好冰冷\N
	Your hands are cold.
	你已失去精灵的永生\N
	The life of the Eldar is leaving you.
	这是我的选择\N
	This was my choice.
	不管你答不答应\N
	Ada, whether by your will or not,
	我都不会搭船离开这儿\N
	there is no ship now that can bear me hence.
	我们刚刚越过刚铎边界\N
	We've just passed into the realm of Gondor.
	米纳斯提里斯\N
	Minas Tirith.
	众王之城\N
	City of kings.
	让开！\N
	Make way!
	就是那棵树\N
	It's the tree.
	甘道夫，甘道夫\N
	Gandalf. Gandalf.
	这就是刚铎的圣白树\N
	Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.
	王者之树\N
	The tree of the king.
	但是迪耐瑟并不是国王\N
	Lord Denethor, however, is not king.
	他只是刚铎的宰相和摄政王\N
	He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.
	听好，迪耐瑟大人是波罗莫的父亲\N
	Now listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.
	你最好别让他知道他爱子的死讯\N
	To give him news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise.
	也别提起弗罗多和魔戒的事\N
	And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.
	更别提到阿拉贡\N
	And say nothing of Aragorn either.
	你最好一句话都不要说，皮瑞格林·图克\N
	In fact, it's better if you don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.
	迪耐瑟大人，爱克西里昂之子，刚铎的宰相和摄政王\N
	Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion, lord and steward of Gondor.
	我在黑暗来临前给予我的忠告\N
	I come with tidings in this dark hour, and with counsel.
	也许你能给我一个交代\N
	Perhaps you come to explain this.
	也许你是来告诉我，我儿子的死因\N
	Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead.
	波罗莫是为了救我们而死\N
	Boromir died to save us,
	我跟我的同胞\N
	my kinsman and me.
	-他为了保护我们壮烈牺牲  -皮平\N
	-He fell defending us from many foes.  -Pippin.
	为了回报他的救命之恩\N
	I offer you my service, such as it is
	我愿意效忠于你\N
	in payment of this debt.
	既然如此，我要问你\N
	This is my first command to you.
	你为什么能逃走，而我儿子武艺这么高强\N
	How did you escape and my son did not,
	却不能活着逃出来？\N
	so mighty a man as he was?
	一箭就能致强者于死地\N
	The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow
	更何况波罗莫身中了好几箭\N
	and Boromir was pierced by many.
	起来\N
	Get up.
	大人，请你以后再为波罗莫哀悼\N
	My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir,
	现在并不是时候\N
	but it is not now.
	大战即将展开\N
	War is coming.
	敌军已经逼近边界，你身为刚铎宰相\N
	The enemy is on your doorstep. As steward, you are charged
	必须捍卫这座城市。刚铎的军队在哪里？\N
	with the defense of this city. Where are Gondor's armies?
	你仍然有盟友，你并不会孤军奋战\N
	You still have friends. You are not alone in this fight.
	向洛汗的希优顿王求救，点燃烽火\N
	Send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the beacons.
	你自以为很聪明，米斯兰达\N
	You think you are wise, Mithrandir.
	但是你却低估了我\N
	Yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom.
	你以为我瞎了眼睛吗？\N
	Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind?
	我知道的远比你想像的多\N
	I have seen more than you know.
	你一方面想利用我对抗魔多\N
	With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor.
	另一方面想趁机推翻我\N
	And with your right you'd seek to supplant me.
	我知道谁在协助希优顿王\N
	I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan.
	没错，我早就听过阿拉贡，他是阿拉桑之子\N
	Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
	而我要告诉你，我才不会向北方游侠屈服\N
	And I tell you now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the North,
	他只是失去王位的落魄王族\N
	last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship.
	你无权拒绝国王的回归，你只是宰相\N
	Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the king, steward.
	除了我没有人能统治刚铎\N
	The rule of Gondor is mine and no other's.
	来吧\N
	Come.
	他现在眼里只有权力\N
	All has turned to vain ambition.
	他甚至会用哀伤掩饰他的野心\N
	He would even use his grief as a cloak.
	这座王都屹立了一千年\N
	A thousand years this city has stood.
	现在却要毁于一个疯子的手中\N
	Now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall.
	而圣白树，王者之树\N
	And the White Tree, the tree of the king,
	将永远不会开花\N
	will never bloom again.
	-他们为什么还在守着它？  -因为他们仍抱有一线希望\N
	-Why are they still guarding it?  -They guard it because they have hope.
	小小的希望寄予这圣白树还会再开花结果\N
	A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower.
	国王将回归，王都也将恢复昔日的光辉\N
	That a king will come and this city will be as it once was
	而不会遭到毁灭\N
	before it fell into decay.
	西方孕育的智慧早被遗忘\N
	The old wisdom borne out of the West was forsaken.
	历任国王盖的墓陵远比王宫还要奢华\N
	Kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living,
	他们只会缅怀先祖的丰功伟业\N
	and counted the old names of their descent
	却对自己的儿子不屑一顾\N
	dearer than the names of their sons.
	后继无人的城主，坐在古老的宫殿墨守成规\N
	Childless lords sat in aged halls, musing on heraldry
	或是登上冰冷的高塔，求神问运，占星卜卦\N
	or in high, cold towers, asking questions of the stars.
	刚铎人民命运堪虞\N
	And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.
	王室香火无以为继\N
	The line of kings failed.
	圣白树也枯萎凋零\N
	The White Tree withered.
	刚铎将落入敌人手中\N
	The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.
	魔多\N
	Mordor.
	是的，它就在那儿\N
	Yes, there it lies.
	这座城市长久以来都笼罩在它的阴影之下\N
	This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.
	暴风雨即将来临\N
	A storm is coming.
	这并不是自然的现象\N
	This is not the weather of the world.
	而是索伦一手造成的异象\N
	This is a device of Sauron's making.
	这也是他大举进攻的前兆\N
	A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host.
	魔多的半兽人不能忍受阳光\N
	The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight,
	所以他就将太阳遮蔽\N
	so he covers the face of the sun
	好让他们踏上征途\N
	to ease their passage along the road to war.
	当魔多的魔影到达这座城市\N
	When the Shadow of Mordor reaches this city,
	大战就会展开\N
	it will begin.
	是啊\N
	Well,
	米纳斯提里斯\N
	Minas Tirith,
	真是令人叹为观止\N
	very impressive.
	-接下来我们去哪儿？  -现在要走太迟了，皮瑞格林\N
	-So where are we off to next?  -Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.
	我们无法离开这座城市\N
	There's no leaving this city.
	救兵一定要赶来支援\N
	Help must come to us.
	下午茶时间一定快到了\N
	It must be getting near teatime.
	如果在好一点的地方，就还能喝到下午茶\N
	Leastways, it would be in decent places where there is still teatime.
	我们不是在一个好地方\N
	We're not in decent places.
	弗罗多先生？\N
	Mr. Frodo?
	怎么了？\N
	What is it?
	我有一种预感\N
	It's just a feeling.
	我想我回不了家了\N
	I don't think I'll be coming back.
	你回得了家，你一定会回家\N
	Yes, you will. Of course you will.
	别乱想了\N
	That's just morbid thinking.
	我们一定会去而复返\N
	We're going there and back again,
	就跟比尔博先生一样\N
	just like Mr. Bilbo.
	你等着瞧\N
	You'll see.
	这些土地曾经是刚铎王国的一部份\N
	I think these lands were once part of the kingdom of Gondor.
	在很久以前，还有国王的时候\N
	Long ago, when there was a king.
	弗罗多先生，快看\N
	Mr. Frodo, look.
	国王头上又有王冠了\N
	The king has got a crown again.
	快来啊，霍比特人，不要停下来，往这儿走\N
	Come on, Hobbits! Mustn't stop now. This way.
	我猜我只是挂名的卫兵吧\N
	So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.
	我是说，我不必真的上战场吧\N
	I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting.
	-对不对？  -你已经对宰相宣誓效忠\N
	-Do they?  -You're in the service of the steward now.
	你必须奉命行事，皮瑞格林·图克\N
	You'll have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took.
	蠢霍比特人\N
	Ridiculous Hobbit.
	刚铎卫兵\N
	Guard of the Citadel.
	谢谢你\N
	Thank you.
	天上没有星星\N
	There's no more stars.
	时候到了吗？\N
	Is it time?
	是的\N
	Yes.
	好安静啊\N
	It's so quiet.
	这只是暴风雨前的宁静\N
	It's the deep breath before the plunge.
	我不想上战场\N
	I don't want to be in a battle,
	但是等待一场不可避免的大战更令人害怕\N
	but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse.
	甘道夫，弗罗多和山姆还有希望吗？\N
	Is there any hope, Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?
	他们没多少希望了\N
	There never was much hope.
	只剩下一点点\N
	Just a fool's hope.
	敌人已蓄势待发\N
	Our enemy is ready.
	他集结了强大兵力\N
	His full strength's gathered.
	不只是半兽人，还有邪恶的人类\N
	Not only Orcs, but Men as well.
	来自南方的哈拉德林人\N
	Legions of Haradrim from the south,
	以及来自海岸的佣兵\N
	mercenaries from the coast.
	全都听从魔多的命令\N
	All will answer Mordor's call.
	来吧\N
	Come on.
	刚铎将难逃灭亡的命运\N
	This will be the end of Gondor as we know it.
	敌人会对这里展开猛烈攻势\N
	Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.
	如果安都因河被占领，奥斯吉力亚斯碉堡被攻陷\N
	If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls,
	这座城市的最后防线就会瓦解\N
	the last defense of this city will be gone.
	但我们还有你这个白袍巫师，你一定会有办法的\N
	But we have the White Wizard. That's got to count for something.
	甘道夫？\N
	Gandalf?
	索伦已经派出了他最厉害的手下\N
	Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant,
	他将率领魔多大军发动战争\N
	the one who will lead Mordor's armies in war.
	传说中没有活人杀得了他\N
	The one they say no living man can kill.
	安格玛的巫王\N
	The Witch King of Angmar.
	你见过他\N
	You've met him before.
	他在风云顶刺了弗罗多一剑\N
	He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.
	他就是戒灵之王\N
	He is the lord of the Nazgel,
	九戒灵之首\N
	the greatest of the Nine.
	他的巢穴是米那斯魔窟\N
	Minas Morgul is his lair.
	死城\N
	The Dead City.
	可怕的地方，到处都是敌人\N
	Very nasty place. Full of enemies.
	快点，快呀\N
	Quick. Quick.
	他们会看到我们，他们能看到我们\N
	They will see. They will see.
	别过去，别过去，瞧，我们找到了\N
	Come away. Come away. Look, we have found it.
	通往魔多的路\N
	The way into Mordor.
	秘密阶梯\N
	The secret stair.
	往上爬\N
	Climb.
	-不，弗罗多先生！  -不是那里！\N
	-No, Mr. Frodo!  -Not that way!
	-你在干嘛？  -别去\N
	-What's it doing?  -No.
	-戒灵在召唤我  -糟了\N
	-They're calling me.  -No.
	快躲起来！躲起来！\N
	Hide! Hide!
	我能感觉到他的剑锋\N
	I can feel his blade.
	决战时刻终于来临\N
	We come to it at last.
	魔戒圣战即将展开\N
	The great battle of our time.
	来吧，霍比特人，我们一定要爬上去\N
	Come away, Hobbits. We climb. We must climb.
	棋盘已经摆好\N
	The board is set.
	棋子开始移动\N
	The pieces are moving.
	往上爬，往上爬，爬上阶梯\N
	Up, up, up the stairs we go.
	然后就进入隧道\N
	And then it's into the tunnel.
	这个隧道里头有什么？\N
	Hey, what's in this tunnel?
	听我说，你给我听好了\N
	You listen to me, and you listen good and proper.
	要是他出事，你会倒大霉\N
	Anything happens to him, you'll have me to answer to.
	我只要觉得什么不对劲\N
	One sniff something's not right,
	要是我背上的汗毛竖起来，你就玩完了\N
	one hair stands up on the back of my head, it's over.
	我会宰了你，宰了你这个臭东西\N
	No more slinker. No more stinker.
	到时你就死定了，懂吗？\N
	You're gone. Got it?
	我在看着你\N
	I'm watching you.
	你刚才跟他说什么？\N
	What was that about?
	没什么，只是交代一些事\N
	Nothing. Just clearing something up.
	皮瑞格林·图克，你要完成一项任务\N
	Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task now to be done.
	让你这霍比特人有机会再次证明自己的能力\N
	Another opportunity for one of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.
	你绝对不能失败\N
	You must not fail me.
	敌人在对岸没有任何动静\N
	It's been very quiet across the river.
	半兽人躲起来了\N
	The Orcs are lying low.
	他们很可能已经撤退\N
	The garrison may have moved out.
	我们派了探子到凯尔·安卓斯\N
	We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.
	如果半兽人从北边进攻，我们会得到预警\N
	If the Orcs attack from the north, we'll have some warning.
	安静\N
	Quiet.
	这儿再来十个人\N
	We need 10 more.
	杀了他！\N
	Kill him!
	他们并不是从北边进攻\N
	They're not coming from the north.
	快到河边，快走，快，跟上\N
	To the river. Quick. Quick. Go. Come on.
	划快一点\N
	Faster.
	拔剑\N
	Draw swords.
	挡住，挡住他们！\N
	Hold. Hold them!
	那是什么？\N
	What?
	阿蒙丁\N
	Amon Din.
	烽火！阿蒙丁的烽火被点燃了\N
	The beacon. The beacon of Amon Din is lit.
	终于燃起一线希望\N
	Hope is kindled.
	米纳斯提里斯的烽火！烽火被点燃了！\N
	The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit!
	刚铎向我们求救\N
	Gondor calls for aid.
	洛汗将前往支援\N
	And Rohan will answer.
	洛汗全军集结\N
	Muster the Rohirrim.
	召集登哈洛大军\N
	Assemble the army at Dunharrow.
	尽量召集人马，我给你两天时间\N
	As many men as can be found. You have two days.
	第三天就整装出发，前往刚铎展开大战\N
	On the third, we ride for Gondor and war.
	-前进  -很好\N
	-Forward.  -Very good, sir.
	-加姆林  -吾王\N
	-Gamling.  -My lord.
	全速跨越洛汗平原\N
	Make haste across the Riddermark.
	召集人马前往登哈洛\N
	Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.
	遵命\N
	I will.
	-你跟我们一起去吗？  -我最远只能跟到营地\N
	-Will you ride with us?  -Just to the encampment.
	按照传统，王女必须为士兵送行\N
	It's tradition for the women of the court to farewell the men.
	人民已经找到他们的领袖\N
	The men have found their captain.
	他们愿意跟随你作战，甚至愿意壮烈牺牲\N
	They will follow you into battle, even to death.
	你给了我们希望\N
	You have given us hope.
	对不起\N
	Excuse me.
	我有一把剑\N
	I have a sword.
	请你让我参战\N
	Please accept it.
	我愿意为你效忠，希优顿王\N
	I offer you my service, Theoden King.
	我很乐意接受\N
	And gladly I accept it.
	我封你为梅利阿道克·洛汗骑士\N
	You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.
	骠骑勇士\N
	Horse-Men.
	我真希望能召集矮人大军，披上盔甲和你们并肩作战\N
	I wish I could muster a legion of Dwarves, fully armed and filthy.
	你的族人不需要参战\N
	Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war.
	战争就已经找上门了\N
	I fear war already marches on their own lands.
	米纳斯提里斯的决战\N
	So it is before the walls of Minas Tirith,
	将决定人类是否会灭亡\N
	the doom of our time will be decided.
	这是决战时刻，洛汗的勇士们，你们曾许下诺言\N
	Now is the hour. Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.
	现在该兑现承诺了，为了吾王，为了吾国！\N
	Now, fulfill them all. To lord and land!
	法拉墨！\N
	Faramir!
	我们抵挡不了，城市已经沦陷\N

	Why does he leave on the eve of battle?
	他离开因为他觉得没有希望\N

	Charge!
	快放箭！\N
	Fire at will!
	在我们身上点火\N
	Set a fire in our flesh.
	快给我住手！\N
	Stay this madness!
	也许今天你可以侥幸打一场胜仗\N
	You may triumph in the field of battle for a day,
	然而面对从东方升起的邪恶力量\N
	but against the power that has risen in the east,
	你永远都无法获得胜利\N
	there is no victory.
	不！\N
	No!
	你不能夺走我儿子！\N
	You will not take my son from me!
	不！\N
	No!
	法拉墨\N
	Faramir.
	迪耐瑟，爱克西里昂之子死了\N
	So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

	梅里！\N
	Merry!
	没想到我的生命会在这里走到尽头\N
	I didn't think it would end this way.
	尽头？\N
	End?
	不，这不是尽头\N
	No, the journey doesn't end here.
	死亡只不过是另一条路\N
	Death is just another path,
	一条我们都会走的路\N
	one that we all must take.
	当灰色的天空放晴\N
	The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back
	眼前一片银白透明\N
	and all turns to silver glass.
	你就会看见它\N
	And then you see it.
	什么，甘道夫？\N
	What, Gandalf?
	看见什么？\N
	See what?
	洁白的海岸\N
	White shores
	死后的世界\N
	and beyond.
	在黎明的晨曦中\N
	A far green country
	有一片辽阔的绿茵\N
	under a swift sunrise.
	哇\N
	Well,
	听起来真不错\N
	that isn't so bad.
	是啊\N
	No.
	是不错\N
	No, it isn't.
	大家围过来！围过来！\N
	Rally to me! To me!
	好好享用他的肉\N
	Feast on his flesh.
	你敢碰他，我就杀了你\N
	I will kill you if you touch him.
	别阻挡戒灵对他的猎物下手\N
	Do not come between the Nazgul and his prey.
	你们迟到了，混蛋海盗\N
	Late as usual, pirate scum!
	准备大开杀戒吧\N
	There's knife-work here needs doing.
	快点，臭海盗，快滚下船！\N

	再来比比看谁杀的敌人多\N
	There's plenty for the both of us.
	最猛的矮人一定赢\N

	你这个蠢货\N
	You fool.
	没有人（男人）能杀得了我\N

	我不是男人\N

	我认得你的样子\N
	I know your face.
	伊欧文\N
	Eowyn.
	我就快死了\N
	My eyes darken.
	不\N
	No.
	不\N
	No.
	我会救你\N
	I am going to save you.
	你已经救了我\N
	You already did.
	伊欧文\N
	Eowyn,
	我的伤太重了\N
	my body is broken.
	你要让我走\N
	You have to let me go.
	我将加入列祖列宗的行列\N
	I go to my fathers
	就算在伟大的先王身边\N
	in whose mighty company,
	我也不会感到羞愧\N
	I shall not now feel ashamed.
	伊欧文\N
	Eowyn.
	让我们走吧\N
	Release us.
	最好不要\N
	Bad idea.
	这些死人头，在危机时刻还挺有用的\N
	Very handy in a tight spot, these lads, despite the fact they're dead.
	你答应过我们\N
	You gave us your word.
	你们实现了誓言\N
	I hold your oath fulfilled.
	去吧\N
	Go.
	安息吧\N
	Be at peace.
	梅里\N
	Merry.
	不！\N
	No!
	不！\N
	No!
	随着一声叹息\N
	With a sigh.
	你转身而去\N
	You turn away.
	随着一阵心痛\N
	With a deepening heart.
	你已无话可说\N
	No more words to say.
	你会发现\N
	You will find.
	世界已经改变\N
	That the world has changed forever.
	永远改变\N
	Changed forever.
	树木从苍绿变成金黄\N
	And the trees are now turning from green to gold.
	太阳也将西沉\N
	And the sun is now fading.
	多希望我能抱住你\N
	I wish I could hold you closer.
	更紧一点\N
	A closer
	梅里！\N
	Merry!
	梅里！\N
	Merry!
	梅里\N
	Merry.
	梅里，是我\N
	Merry, it's me.
	我是皮平\N
	It's Pippin.
	我就知道你会找到我\N
	I knew you'd find me.
	当然\N
	Yes.
	你要撇下我不管吗？\N
	Are you going to leave me?
	不，梅里\N
	No, Merry.
	我要照顾你\N
	I'm going to look after you.
	别碰它！\N
	Hands off!
	那件银衣是我的\N
	That shiny shirt, that's mine.
	我要把一切都交给伟大的邪眼\N
	It's going to the Great Eye, along with everything else.
	我才不听魔窟鼠辈的命令！\N
	I don't take orders from stinking Morgul-rats!
	你敢碰它，我就一剑宰了你\N
	You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in your gut.
	那混球想杀我\N
	The scum tried to knife me.
	杀了他！\N
	Kill him!
	这一剑是为了弗罗多！\N
	That's for Frodo!
	这一剑是为了夏尔！\N
	And for the Shire!
	而这一剑是为了我的老爹！\N
	And that's for my old Gaffer!
	别垂死挣扎了，小东西\N
	Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.
	我要在你身上刺个透明窟窿\N
	I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.
	我先要你的命\N
	Not if I stick you first.
	山姆！\N
	Sam!
	山姆，对不起\N
	Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.
	我真是对不起你\N
	Sorry for everything.
	-我先把你救出去  -太迟了，一切都完了\N
	-Let's get you out of here.  -It's too late. It's over.
	他们把它拿走了，山姆\N
	They've taken it, Sam.
	他们把魔戒拿走了\N
	They took the Ring.
	放心，他们并没有\N
	Begging your pardon, but they haven't.
	我以为你死了\N
	I thought I'd lost you.
	所以我就把它拿走\N
	So I took it.
	我只是保管它\N
	Only for safekeeping.
	把它给我\N
	Give it to me.
	把魔戒给我，山姆\N
	Give me the Ring, Sam.
	山姆\N
	Sam.
	把魔戒交给我\N
	Give me the Ring.
	你必须明白\N
	You must understand.
	魔戒是我的责任\N
	The Ring is my burden.
	它会毁了你，山姆\N
	It will destroy you, Sam.
	来吧，弗罗多先生\N
	Come on, Mr. Frodo.
	你最好找件衣服穿\N
	We best find you some clothes.
	你可不能光着身子去魔多\N
	You can't go walking through Mordor in naught but your skin.
	我们到了，弗罗多先生\N
	We did it, Mr. Frodo.
	我们终于到了魔多\N
	We made it to Mordor.
	有好多敌人\N
	There are so many of them.
	我们一定会被发现\N
	We'll never get through unseen.
	是他，邪眼\N
	It's him, the Eye.
	我们非去不可，弗罗多先生\N
	We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.
	没别的选择\N
	There's nothing for it.
	来吧，先下了山再说\N
	Come on. Let's just make it down the hill for starters.
	我看不到弗罗多的行踪\N
	Frodo has passed beyond my sight.
	黑暗笼罩大地\N
	The darkness is deepening.
	如果魔戒被索伦夺取，我们会得知消息\N
	If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.
	这是迟早的事\N
	It's only a matter of time.
	他是吃了场败仗，是的，但是\N
	He has suffered a defeat, yes but
	他正在魔多重新集结大军\N
	behind the walls of Mordor, our enemy is regrouping.
	让他留在那里吧\N
	Let him stay there.
	让他去死吧！我们为什么要怕他？\N
	Let him rot! Why should we care?
	因为有一万名半兽人会阻止弗罗多前往末日火山\N
	Because 10,000 Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom.
	我等于是让他去送死\N
	I've sent him to his death.
	不\N
	No.
	弗罗多仍有一线希望\N
	There is still hope for Frodo.
	他需要时间穿越苟格罗斯平原\N
	He needs time and safe passage across the plains of Gorgoroth.
	-我们能替他争取时间  -怎么争取？\N
	-We can give him that.  -How?
	把索伦的大军引出来\N
	Draw out Sauron's armies.
	让魔多变成空城\N
	Empty his lands.
	然后我们以全部兵力攻打黑门\N
	Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate.
	我们的兵力不能打败敌人\N
	We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.
	我们不必打败他们\N
	Not for ourselves.
	只要让索伦心无旁骛，专心地对付我们\N
	But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.
	弗罗多就有成功的机会\N
	Keep him blind to all else that moves.
	声东击西\N
	A diversion.
	成功机率很小\N
	Certainty of death,
	几乎是去送死\N
	small chance of success,
	我们还在等什么？\N
	what are we waiting for?
	索伦一定会起疑心\N
	Sauron will suspect a trap.
	他不会轻易上当\N
	He will not take the bait.
	不，我想他会上当\N
	Oh, I think he will.
	你猎杀我太久太久了\N
	Long have you hunted me.
	我也躲着你太久太久了\N
	Long have I eluded you.
	我不想再躲下去了\N
	No more.
	看我的伊伦迪尔圣剑\N
	Behold the Sword of Elendil.
	整座城市静悄悄的\N
	The city has fallen silent.
	太阳没有一丝暖意\N
	There is no warmth left in the sun.
	空气越来越冷\N
	It grows so cold.
	下了第一阵春雨才会这么潮湿冰冷\N
	It's just the damp of the first spring rain.
	我相信黑暗很快就会过去\N
	I do not believe this darkness will endure.
	你看，那些半兽人\N
	Look, the Orcs,
	他们走了\N
	they're moving off.
	你看吧，弗罗多先生\N
	You see, Mr. Frodo,
	我们终于有好运气了\N
	some luck at last.
	动作快点，懒虫！\N
	Move it, you slugs!
	快点！快点！\N
	Come on! Faster!
	快跟上来！你这个猥琐的败类\N
	Come along, you coldhearted wretched scum,
	不然我就把你打到皮开肉绽\N
	I'll whip you down to the bone, you.
	快点！\N
	Come on!
	我是怎么跟你们说的？\N
	What have I told you?
	起来！\N
	Get up!
	快起来！懒东西！\N
	Come on, you slugs!
	你们两个到前面去\N
	You two are going straight to the front line!
	快！走快点！快走！快前进！\N
	Now, move it! Go on! Fall in! Move it! Move it! Move it!
	快到大门去，臭懒虫！快走！\N
	To the Gate, you slugs! Now, move it!
	你不知道我们在打仗吗？\N
	Don't you know we're at war?
	全体！停下来！\N
	Company, halt!
	我要检查！\N
	Inspection!
	山姆！快帮我\N
	Sam, help me.
	弗罗多先生！\N
	Mr. Frodo!
	起来，弗罗多先生，快起来！\N
	Stand up, Mr. Frodo. Stand up!
	它好重\N
	It's so heavy.
	糟了\N
	Oh, no.
	我该怎么办？我们该怎么办？\N
	What do I do? What do we do?
	-打我  -什么？\N
	-Hit me.  -What?
	快打我，山姆，假装打架\N
	Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.
	给我滚开！\N
	Get off of me!
	没有人敢惹我，你这臭东西\N
	Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.
	快滚！\N
	Get off of me!
	别打了！别打了！\N
	Break it up! Break it up!
	你不乖乖住手，我就把你开膛破肚！\N
	I'll have your guts if you don't shut this rabble down!
	走吧，山姆，快！\N
	Go, Sam. Now!
	继续前进，混蛋！\N
	Move along, scum!
	回到队伍里！\N
	Back in the line!
	臭东西！\N
	You maggots!
	站好队，臭东西！\N
	Get back into the line, you slugs!
	快！懒惰！快走！\N
	Dig it, you slugs. Move it.
	快点\N
	Hurry up
	我不行了\N
	I can't.
	我承受不了魔戒的压力，山姆\N
	I can't manage the Ring, Sam.
	它真的太重了\N
	It's such a weight to carry.
	它\N
	It's
	重到让人受不了\N
	such a weight.
	我们要走那里，尽量走直线\N
	We're going that way. Straight as we can.
	不需要的东西都不带了\N
	There's no point carrying anything we're not sure to need.
	弗罗多先生\N
	Mr. Frodo.
	你看\N
	Look.
	上面有光亮\N
	There is light
	好耀眼的光芒\N
	and beauty up there
	没有任何阴影能盖住它\N
	that no shadow can touch.
	喝我的\N
	Take mine.
	里面还有几滴水\N
	There's a few drops left.
	可是回去就没水喝了\N
	There will be none left for the return journey.
	我想我们是回不去了，弗罗多先生\N
	I don't think there will be a return journey, Mr. Frodo.
	弗罗多，快趴下！\N
	Frodo, get down!
	快躲起来！\N
	Hide!
	弗罗多！\N
	Frodo!
	他们在哪里？\N
	Where are they?
	黑暗魔君快现身！\N
	Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!
	我要让他就地伏法！\N
	Let justice be done upon him!
	我的主人，伟大的魔君索伦欢迎你们\N
	My master, Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome.
	你们哪一位可以代表跟我谈判？\N
	Is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me?
	我们不是来跟索伦谈判的\N
	We do not come to treat with Sauron,
	那个受诅咒的恶魔\N
	faithless and accursed.
	告诉你的主子，魔多大军必须解散\N
	Tell your master this, The armies of Mordor must disband.
	他要滚出中土世界，永远不再回来\N
	He is to depart these lands, never to return.
	灰胡子老爹\N
	Old Greybeard.
	我有一件信物要给你看\N
	I have a token I was bidden to show thee.
	弗罗多\N
	Frodo.
	弗罗多\N
	Frodo.
	-安静  -不！\N
	-Silence.  -No!
	安静！\N
	Silence!
	原来那个半身人对你们这么重要\N
	The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.
	他在我们手上受了很痛苦的折磨\N
	Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host.
	谁会料到这么小的身躯能忍受这么大的痛苦？\N
	Who would've thought one so small could endure so much pain?
	而他做到了，但被折磨的不成人形，甘道夫\N
	And he did, Gandalf.
	痛苦不堪\N
	He did.
	这又是谁？\N
	And who is this?
	埃西铎的子嗣？\N
	Isildur's heir?
	想要当国王光有一把破烂的精灵宝剑还不够\N
	It takes more to make a king than a broken Elvish blade.
	我猜我们的谈判结束了\N
	I guess that concludes negotiations.
	我不信\N
	I do not believe it.
	我不相信\N
	I will not.
	往后退\N
	Pull back.
	往后退！\N
	Pull back!
	它走了，弗罗多先生\N
	It's gone, Mr. Frodo.
	那道光移到北面去了\N
	The light's passed on, away towards the north.
	它被什么引开了\N
	Something's drawn its gaze.
	稳住阵线！稳住阵线！\N
	Hold your ground! Hold your ground!
	刚铎和洛汗的好男儿！我的好兄弟！\N
	Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!
	我在你们眼中看到恐惧\N
	I see in your eyes,
	我内心中也充满着同样的恐惧\N
	the same fear that would take the heart of me.
	有一天，人类将失去勇气\N
	A day may come when the courage of Men fails,
	我们会众叛亲离，一败涂地\N
	when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship.
	但那不会是在今天！\N
	But it is not this day！
	有一天，邪将胜正\N
	An hour of wolves and shattered shields,
	人类的世界也会完全毁灭\N
	when the age of Men comes crashing down.
	但那不会是在今天！\N
	But it is not this day！
	今天，我们要誓死奋战！\N
	This day we fight!
	为了你们在世上所珍惜的一切\N
	By all that you hold dear on this good earth,
	一定要奋战到底，西方的人类！\N
	I bid you stand, Men of the West!
	我从来没想过我会跟一个精灵一起战死\N
	Never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an Elf.
	那和一个朋友一起战死呢？\N
	What about side by side with a friend?
	好\N
	Aye.
	我愿意\N
	I could do that.
	弗罗多先生，你还记得夏尔吗？\N
	Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo?
	春天就要来到了\N
	It'll be spring soon.
	果树也都要开花了\N
	And the orchards will be in blossom.
	鸟儿会在榛树上筑巢\N
	And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket.
	人们很快就要收割大麦\N
	And they'll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields
	沾鲜奶油吃初摘的草莓\N
	and eating the first of the strawberries with cream.
	你还记得草莓的味道吗？\N
	Do you remember the taste of strawberries?
	不，山姆\N
	No, Sam.
	我不记得食物的味道\N
	I can't recall the taste of food,
	也不记得流水声\N
	nor the sound of water,
	或是稻草扑鼻的香\N
	nor the touch of grass.
	我\N
	I'm
	赤裸裸的站在黑暗中\N
	naked in the dark.
	我跟邪眼之间\N
	There's nothing.
	没有任何阻隔\N
	No veil between me and the wheel of fire.
	我的双眼\N
	I can see him
	清楚地看到它\N
	with my waking eyes.
	那就把它毁掉吧\N
	Then let us be rid of it,
	让它永远消失\N
	once and for all.
	来吧，弗罗多先生\N
	Come on, Mr. Frodo.
	我不能替你背负这重担\N
	I can't carry it for you,
	但是我可以背你\N
	but I can carry you！
	来吧！\N
	Come on!
	阿拉贡\N
	Aragorn.
	伊力萨王\N
	Elessar.
	为了弗罗多\N
	For Frodo.
	你看，弗罗多先生\N
	Look, Mr. Frodo.
	一道门\N
	A doorway.
	就快到了\N
	We're almost there.
	聪明的霍比特人爬到这么高！\N
	Clever Hobbits to climb so high!
	不能去那边\N
	Mustn't go that way.
	不能毁了宝贝\N
	Mustn't hurt the precious.
	你发过誓！\N
	You swore!
	你对着宝贝发誓！\N
	You swore on the precious!
	斯美戈发过誓！\N
	Smeagol promised!
	斯美戈是骗你的\N
	Smeagol lied.
	弗罗多！\N
	Frodo!
	巨鹰\N
	Eagles.
	巨鹰来帮忙了！\N
	The eagles are coming!
	弗罗多！\N
	Frodo!
	我在这里，山姆\N
	I'm here, Sam.
	毁了它！\N
	Destroy it!
	快点！快呀！\N
	Go on! Now!
	把它丢进烈焰中！\N
	Throw it in the fire!
	你还在等什么？\N
	What are you waiting for?
	快放手！\N
	Just let it go!
	魔戒是我的\N
	The Ring is mine.
	不\N
	No.
	不要\N
	No.
	不！\N
	No!
	好啊！\N
	Yes!
	好啊！\N
	Yes!
	宝贝！宝贝！宝贝！宝贝！\N
	Precious! Precious! Precious! Precious!
	把手伸出来！\N
	Give me your hand!
	抓住我的手！\N
	Take my hand!
	不！\N
	No!
	千万别放手\N
	Don't you let go.
	别放手\N
	Don't let go.
	抓住！\N
	Reach!
	弗罗多！\N
	Frodo!
	弗罗多！\N
	Frodo!
	它不见了\N
	It's gone.
	任务完成了\N
	It's done.
	没错，弗罗多先生\N
	Yes, Mr. Frodo.
	一切都结束了\N
	It's over now.
	我看得见夏尔了\N
	I can see the Shire.
	烈酒河\N
	The Brandywine River.
	袋底洞\N
	Bag End.
	甘道夫绚丽的烟火\N
	Gandalf's fireworks.
	宴会树上灿烂的灯光\N
	The lights in the Party Tree.
	小玟卡顿在跳舞\N
	Rosie Cotton dancing.

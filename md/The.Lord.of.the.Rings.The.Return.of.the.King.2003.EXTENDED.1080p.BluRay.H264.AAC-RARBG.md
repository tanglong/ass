	Well, let's just have his head and be done with it.

	You have fought many wars and slain many men, Theoden King,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}然后又能维持和平\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and made peace afterwards.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}难道我们不能像以前一样一起共商国是吗，我的老朋友？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Can we not take counsel together as we once did, my old friend?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}难道我们像过去一样和平相处吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	along with the crowns of the seven kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!

	You were deep in the enemy's counsel.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}所以你是来打探军情的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So you have come here for information.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我倒是可以透露一些消急\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	You were once a Man of Rohan.

	A light shone behind me,

	but I could not turn.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我只能站在那儿，等待着\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I could only stand there, waiting.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}人到了晚上就容易胡思乱想\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Night changes many thoughts.

	Something stirs in the east.

	The Eye of the enemy is moving.

	What are you doing?

	There was a white tree
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}在石砌的庭院中央\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	in a courtyard of stone.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}它枯死了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It was dead.

	I saw,

	I saw him.

	There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

	A fool,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}不过是个诚实的蠢小子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	but an honest fool he remains.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他没跟索伦提到弗罗多和魔戒的事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们算是很幸运\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We've been strangely fortunate.

	His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}伊伦迪尔的继承人出现了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He knows the heir of Elendil has come forth.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}人类并没有他想的那么脆弱\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Men are not as weak as he supposed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}人类仍有勇气，也许有足够的力量挑战他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There is courage still, strength enough perhaps to challenge him.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}索伦害怕这一点\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sauron fears this.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他不能让中土世界的人民在同一个旗帜下奋勇作战\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He will not risk the peoples of Middle-earth uniting under one banner.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他想摧毁米纳斯提里斯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground

	before he sees a king return to the throne of Men.

	why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们欠刚铎什么吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What do we owe Gondor?

	-I don't know. I can't help it.  -You never can.

	I'm sorry, all right?

	-I won't do it again.  -Don't you understand?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}敌人以为魔戒在你手上\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	Three days' ride, as the Nazgul flies.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你最好祈祷他们不会追上来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And you better hope we don't have one of those on our tail.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}拿去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Here.

	since before we were tweens.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我总是害他惹上各种麻烦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I would get him into the worst sort of trouble,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}可是我也一定会替他解围\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	but I was always there to get him out.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}现在他不在了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他们都很坚强\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They're a most hardy folk.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}有时候也很傻，他可是图克家的子弟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你看见一个小孩，那是我的儿子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You saw there was a child. You saw my son.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这个未来可能无法成真\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That future is almost gone.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}但是仍有希望\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	It is time.

	Re-forge the sword.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你的手好冰冷\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Your hands are cold.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你已失去精灵的永生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The life of the Eldar is leaving you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这是我的选择\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This was my choice.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}不管你答不答应\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Ada, whether by your will or not,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我都不会搭船离开这儿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	there is no ship now that can bear me hence.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们刚刚越过刚铎边界\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We've just passed into the realm of Gondor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}米纳斯提里斯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Minas Tirith.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}众王之城\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	City of kings.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}让开！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Make way!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}就是那棵树\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's the tree.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}甘道夫，甘道夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gandalf. Gandalf.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这就是刚铎的圣白树\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}王者之树\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The tree of the king.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}但是迪耐瑟并不是国王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Lord Denethor, however, is not king.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他只是刚铎的宰相和摄政王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}听好，迪耐瑟大人是波罗莫的父亲\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Now listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你最好别让他知道他爱子的死讯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	To give him news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}也别提起弗罗多和魔戒的事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}更别提到阿拉贡\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And say nothing of Aragorn either.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你最好一句话都不要说，皮瑞格林·图克\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	In fact, it's better if you don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}迪耐瑟大人，爱克西里昂之子，刚铎的宰相和摄政王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion, lord and steward of Gondor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我在黑暗来临前给予我的忠告\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I come with tidings in this dark hour, and with counsel.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}也许你能给我一个交代\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Perhaps you come to explain this.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}也许你是来告诉我，我儿子的死因\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}波罗莫是为了救我们而死\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Boromir died to save us,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我跟我的同胞\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	my kinsman and me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}-他为了保护我们壮烈牺牲  -皮平\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-He fell defending us from many foes.  -Pippin.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}为了回报他的救命之恩\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I offer you my service, such as it is
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我愿意效忠于你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	in payment of this debt.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}既然如此，我要问你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This is my first command to you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你为什么能逃走，而我儿子武艺这么高强\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	How did you escape and my son did not,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}却不能活着逃出来？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	so mighty a man as he was?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}一箭就能致强者于死地\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}更何况波罗莫身中了好几箭\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and Boromir was pierced by many.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}起来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Get up.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}大人，请你以后再为波罗莫哀悼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}现在并不是时候\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	but it is not now.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}大战即将展开\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	War is coming.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}敌军已经逼近边界，你身为刚铎宰相\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The enemy is on your doorstep. As steward, you are charged
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}必须捍卫这座城市。刚铎的军队在哪里？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	with the defense of this city. Where are Gondor's armies?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你仍然有盟友，你并不会孤军奋战\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You still have friends. You are not alone in this fight.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}向洛汗的希优顿王求救，点燃烽火\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the beacons.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你自以为很聪明，米斯兰达\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You think you are wise, Mithrandir.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}但是你却低估了我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你以为我瞎了眼睛吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我知道的远比你想像的多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have seen more than you know.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你一方面想利用我对抗魔多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}另一方面想趁机推翻我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And with your right you'd seek to supplant me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我知道谁在协助希优顿王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}没错，我早就听过阿拉贡，他是阿拉桑之子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}而我要告诉你，我才不会向北方游侠屈服\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And I tell you now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the North,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他只是失去王位的落魄王族\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你无权拒绝国王的回归，你只是宰相\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the king, steward.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}除了我没有人能统治刚铎\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The rule of Gondor is mine and no other's.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}来吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他现在眼里只有权力\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	All has turned to vain ambition.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他甚至会用哀伤掩饰他的野心\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He would even use his grief as a cloak.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这座王都屹立了一千年\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A thousand years this city has stood.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}现在却要毁于一个疯子的手中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}而圣白树，王者之树\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And the White Tree, the tree of the king,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}将永远不会开花\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	will never bloom again.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}-他们为什么还在守着它？  -因为他们仍抱有一线希望\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Why are they still guarding it?  -They guard it because they have hope.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}小小的希望寄予这圣白树还会再开花结果\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}国王将回归，王都也将恢复昔日的光辉\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That a king will come and this city will be as it once was
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}而不会遭到毁灭\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	before it fell into decay.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}西方孕育的智慧早被遗忘\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The old wisdom borne out of the West was forsaken.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}历任国王盖的墓陵远比王宫还要奢华\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他们只会缅怀先祖的丰功伟业\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and counted the old names of their descent
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}却对自己的儿子不屑一顾\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	dearer than the names of their sons.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}后继无人的城主，坐在古老的宫殿墨守成规\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Childless lords sat in aged halls, musing on heraldry
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}或是登上冰冷的高塔，求神问运，占星卜卦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	or in high, cold towers, asking questions of the stars.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}刚铎人民命运堪虞\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}王室香火无以为继\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The line of kings failed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}圣白树也枯萎凋零\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The White Tree withered.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}刚铎将落入敌人手中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}魔多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mordor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}是的，它就在那儿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes, there it lies.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这座城市长久以来都笼罩在它的阴影之下\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}暴风雨即将来临\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A storm is coming.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这并不是自然的现象\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This is not the weather of the world.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}而是索伦一手造成的异象\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This is a device of Sauron's making.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这也是他大举进攻的前兆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}魔多的半兽人不能忍受阳光\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}所以他就将太阳遮蔽\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	so he covers the face of the sun
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}好让他们踏上征途\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	to ease their passage along the road to war.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}当魔多的魔影到达这座城市\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	When the Shadow of Mordor reaches this city,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}大战就会展开\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	it will begin.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}是啊\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Well,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}米纳斯提里斯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Minas Tirith,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}真是令人叹为观止\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	very impressive.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}-接下来我们去哪儿？  -现在要走太迟了，皮瑞格林\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-So where are we off to next?  -Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们无法离开这座城市\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's no leaving this city.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}救兵一定要赶来支援\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Help must come to us.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}下午茶时间一定快到了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It must be getting near teatime.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}如果在好一点的地方，就还能喝到下午茶\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Leastways, it would be in decent places where there is still teatime.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们不是在一个好地方\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We're not in decent places.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}弗罗多先生？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mr. Frodo?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}怎么了？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What is it?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我有一种预感\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's just a feeling.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我想我回不了家了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't think I'll be coming back.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你回得了家，你一定会回家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes, you will. Of course you will.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}别乱想了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's just morbid thinking.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们一定会去而复返\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We're going there and back again,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}就跟比尔博先生一样\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	just like Mr. Bilbo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你等着瞧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You'll see.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这些土地曾经是刚铎王国的一部份\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I think these lands were once part of the kingdom of Gondor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}在很久以前，还有国王的时候\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Long ago, when there was a king.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}弗罗多先生，快看\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mr. Frodo, look.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}国王头上又有王冠了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The king has got a crown again.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}快来啊，霍比特人，不要停下来，往这儿走\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come on, Hobbits! Mustn't stop now. This way.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我猜我只是挂名的卫兵吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我是说，我不必真的上战场吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}-对不对？  -你已经对宰相宣誓效忠\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Do they?  -You're in the service of the steward now.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你必须奉命行事，皮瑞格林·图克\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You'll have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}蠢霍比特人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Ridiculous Hobbit.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}刚铎卫兵\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Guard of the Citadel.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}谢谢你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Thank you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}天上没有星星\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's no more stars.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}时候到了吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Is it time?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}是的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}好安静啊\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's so quiet.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这只是暴风雨前的宁静\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's the deep breath before the plunge.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我不想上战场\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't want to be in a battle,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}但是等待一场不可避免的大战更令人害怕\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}甘道夫，弗罗多和山姆还有希望吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Is there any hope, Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他们没多少希望了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There never was much hope.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}只剩下一点点\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Just a fool's hope.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}敌人已蓄势待发\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Our enemy is ready.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他集结了强大兵力\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	His full strength's gathered.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}不只是半兽人，还有邪恶的人类\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not only Orcs, but Men as well.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}来自南方的哈拉德林人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Legions of Haradrim from the south,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}以及来自海岸的佣兵\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	mercenaries from the coast.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}全都听从魔多的命令\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	All will answer Mordor's call.

	I would not use the Ring.

	Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin and I alone could save her.

	Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}希望自己看起来像他们一样大公无私\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	Boromir would have remembered his father's need.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他就会把那个贵重的礼物带来给我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He would have brought me a kingly gift.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}波罗莫才不会把魔戒带来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Boromir would not have brought the Ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他会伸出手抢走魔戒，沦为魔王的爪牙\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He would have stretched out his hand to this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}-你什么也不懂  -他会把魔戒占为己有\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-You know nothing of this matter!  -He would have kept it for his own.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}然后当他回来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And when he returned,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你绝对认不出自己的儿子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	Father?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}儿子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	Leave me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}小心点，主人，小心点\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Careful, master. Careful.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这座山谷很深\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Very far to fall.

	Why does he hates poor Smeagol?

	What has Smeagol ever done to him?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}主人？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Master?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}主人身上的担子好沉重\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Master carries heavy burden.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}斯美戈知道，很沉重很沉重的担子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Smeagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}小胖子不会懂\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Fat one cannot know.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}斯美戈会照顾主人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他想要它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He wants it.

	He needs it. Smeagol sees it in his eye.

	Very soon he will ask you for it. You will see.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}小胖子会把它从你手中抢过去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The fat one will take it from you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}派出所有军队\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	Mithrandir.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你们最犀利的武器就是勇气\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Courage is the best defense that you have now.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你到底在想什么，皮瑞格林·图克？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}像我这样的霍比特人能为伟大的城主做什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What service can a Hobbit offer such a great lord of Men?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你已经做得很好了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It was well done.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你这种慷慨激昂的行为不该受到冰冷的劝阻\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你要加入要塞卫戍部队\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You are to join the tower guard.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我还以为他们找不到我适合穿的军服\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I didn't think they would find any livery that would fit me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这身军服曾经属于一个少年\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Once belonged to a young boy of the city.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}一个很愚蠢的少年\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A very foolish one,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他浪费太多时间寻找屠龙之术，却没有认真学习好战斗本领\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	who wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending to his studies.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}-这是你的吗？  -是的，是我的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-This was yours?  -Yes, it was mine.

	My father had it made for me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}好吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Well,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我可比当时的你要搞\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm taller than you were then.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}不过我不会再长高了，只会长胖\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Though I'm not likely to grow anymore, except sideways.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我穿军服也不太适合\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Never fitted me either.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}波罗莫比较像一个军人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}但是却很坚强\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But strong.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你想你拥有完全不同的力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I think you have strength of a different kind.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}有一天，你父亲会了解\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And one day, your father will see it.

	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这要看你是不是能凯旋归来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That will depend on the manner of your return.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你想干什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	Chebin Estel anim.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你为什么要走？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Why are you doing this?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}大战即将在东方展开，你不能临阵脱逃\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The war lies to the east. You cannot leave on the eve of battle.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你不能抛弃这些战士\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You cannot abandon the men.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}伊欧文\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Eowyn.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们需要你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We need you here.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你为什么跟来？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Why have you come?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}难道你还不知道吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do you not know?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你爱的只是一个理想，一个幻影\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It is but a shadow and a thought that you love.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我不能回报你的爱\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I cannot give you what you seek.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我第一次看到你，就希望你得到幸福\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have wished you joy since first I saw you.

	Just where do you think you're off to?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这次不行\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not this time.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这次你要留下来，吉姆利\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This time you must stay, Gimli.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你还不知道矮人族最固执吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Have you learned nothing of the stubbornness of Dwarves?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你就认了吧，我们要跟你一起去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You might as well accept it. We're going with you, laddie.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}-怎么回事？  -他要去哪儿？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-What's happening?  -Where is he going?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他要去哪儿？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Where's he going?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我不明白\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't understand.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}阿拉贡大人！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Lord Aragorn!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他为什么在大战前夕离开？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Why does he leave on the eve of battle?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他离开因为他觉得没有希望\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He leaves because there is no hope.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他离开因为他非走不可\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He leaves because he must.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们势单力薄\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Too few have come.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}不可能击败魔多大军\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}没错\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}是不可能\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	we cannot.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}但是我们还是要誓死奋战\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But we will meet them in battle nonetheless.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我留下了指示\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have left instruction.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我死后人民要听你的命令\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The people are to follow your rule in my stead.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}坐上我在金殿的王位\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}如果我们不幸落败\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Long may you defend Edoras,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你要全力捍卫伊多拉斯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你还要我尽什么职责，大人？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What other duty would you have me do, my lord?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}职责？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Duty?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}没有了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我只希望你能重展笑容\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你要率领洛汗人民重建家园\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You shall live to see these days renewed
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}永远不再悲伤\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and no more despair.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}什么人会住在这种鬼地方？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What kind of army would linger in such a place?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}受到诅咒的人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	One that is cursed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}很久以前，亡灵之山的人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Long ago, the Men of the Mountains swore an oath
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}向刚铎最后一位国王发誓\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	to the last king of Gondor,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}只要他一声令下\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	to come to his aid,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}就会前来作战\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	to fight.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}然而当那一刻来临\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But when the time came,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}当刚铎的战况危急\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	when Gondor's need was dire,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他们却仓惶逃亡\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	they fled,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}消失在亡灵之山的阴影中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	vanishing into the darkness of the mountain.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}于是埃西铎诅咒他们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And so lsildur cursed them
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}在实现誓言之前，他们将永远不得安息\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}谁能把他们从灰色的阴影中唤出来？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Who shall call them from the grey twilight?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}被遗忘的人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The forgotten people.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他们誓言效忠国王的继承人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他将从北方而来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	From the north shall he come.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他对他们有所要求\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Need shall drive him.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他将穿过黑暗之门，踏上亡者之道\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我全身的血液都结冰了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}黑暗之门被封住\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The way is shut.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这是亡者打造的门\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It was made by those who are dead.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}由他们负责掌管\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And the Dead keep it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}路被封住了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The way is shut.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}布里哥！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Brego!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我不怕死\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I do not fear death.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}从来没听过有这种事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Well, this is a thing unheard of.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}连精灵都肯进入地底，而矮人却不敢\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	An Elf will go underground where a Dwarf dare not?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我一定会被笑死了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们必须轻装上阵\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We must ride light and swift.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}前面的路还很长\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It is a long road ahead.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}人和马都要保留精力才能在战场上全力奋战\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}小霍比特人不该上战场，梅里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master Meriadoc.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我的朋友都参战了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	All my friends have gone to battle.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}只有我留下来会很丢脸\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I would be ashamed to be left behind.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}到米纳斯提里斯要骑三天\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我的骑士不能浪费力气载你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And none of my riders can bear you as a burden.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我想要参战\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I want to fight.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}别再说了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I will say no more.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}跟我一起去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	Ride now to Gondor!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}怎么了？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What is it?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你看见什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What do you see?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我看到人影\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I see shapes of men.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}还有马匹\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And of horses.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}在哪里？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Where?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}像云朵一般的白旗\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Pale banners like shreds of cloud.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}高举的长矛\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Spears rise,

	like winter-thickets through a shroud of mist.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}后面跟着一群亡者\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Dead are following.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他们受到召唤\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They have been summoned.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}亡者？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Dead?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}召唤？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Summoned?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}好吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I knew that.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我可不怕\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Very good.

	Do not look down.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}是谁闯入我的领地？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Who enters my domain?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你们要效忠的主人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	One who will have your allegiance.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}亡者不能容许活人过去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你要容许我过去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You will suffer me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}黑暗之门被封住了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The way is shut.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这是亡者打造的门\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It was made by those who are dead.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}由他们负责掌管\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And the Dead keep it.

	The way is shut.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}现在你们非死不可\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Now you must die.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我命令你实现你的誓言\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I summon you to fulfill your oath.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}只有刚铎国王才能命令我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	None but the king of Gondor may command me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}圣剑早已断裂\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That line was broken.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}圣剑已被重铸\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It has been remade.

	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你在浪费时间，阿拉贡\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You waste your time, Aragorn.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他们活着没有尊严，死后更没有\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They had no honour in life, they have none now in death.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我是埃西铎的子嗣\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	Say not that he has fallen.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他们寡不敌众\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They were outnumbered.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}没有人生还\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	None survived.

	Let us ease their pain.

	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}准备大开杀戒吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's knife-work here needs doing.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}快点，臭海盗，快滚下船！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come on, you sea rats! Get off your ships!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}再来比比看谁杀的敌人多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's plenty for the both of us.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}最猛的矮人一定赢\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	May the best Dwarf win.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你这个蠢货\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You fool.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}没有人（男人）能杀得了我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No man can kill me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}领死吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Die now.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我不是男人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I am no man.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}-十五！十六！  -十七！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-15! 16!  -17!

	33, 34.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}那样也只能算一个！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That still only counts as one!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}来吧，来吧！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come on, then. Come on!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我认得你的样子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I know your face.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}伊欧文\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Eowyn.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我就快死了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My eyes darken.

	No.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}不\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我会救你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I am going to save you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你已经救了我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You already did.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}伊欧文\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Eowyn,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我的伤太重了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	my body is broken.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你要让我走\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You have to let me go.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我将加入列祖列宗的行列\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I go to my fathers
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}就算在伟大的先王身边\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	in whose mighty company,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我也不会感到羞愧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I shall not now feel ashamed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}伊欧文\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Eowyn.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}让我们走吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Release us.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}最好不要\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bad idea.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这些死人头，在危机时刻还挺有用的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Very handy in a tight spot, these lads, despite the fact they're dead.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你答应过我们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You gave us your word.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你们实现了誓言\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I hold your oath fulfilled.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}去吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Go.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}安息吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Be at peace.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}梅里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Merry.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}不！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}不！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}随着一声叹息\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	With a sigh.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你转身而去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You turn away.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}随着一阵心痛\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	With a deepening heart.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你已无话可说\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No more words to say.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你会发现\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You will find.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}世界已经改变\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That the world has changed forever.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}永远改变\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Changed forever.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}树木从苍绿变成金黄\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And the trees are now turning from green to gold.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}太阳也将西沉\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And the sun is now fading.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}多希望我能抱住你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I wish I could hold you closer.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}更紧一点\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A closer

	Merry!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}梅里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Merry.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}梅里，是我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Merry, it's me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我是皮平\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's Pippin.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我就知道你会找到我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I knew you'd find me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}当然\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你要撇下我不管吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Are you going to leave me?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}不，梅里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No, Merry.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我要照顾你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm going to look after you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}别碰它！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hands off!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}那件银衣是我的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That shiny shirt, that's mine.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我要把一切都交给伟大的邪眼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's going to the Great Eye, along with everything else.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我才不听魔窟鼠辈的命令！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't take orders from stinking Morgul-rats!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你敢碰它，我就一剑宰了你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in your gut.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}那混球想杀我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The scum tried to knife me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}杀了他！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Kill him!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这一剑是为了弗罗多！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's for Frodo!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这一剑是为了夏尔！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And for the Shire!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}而这一剑是为了我的老爹！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And that's for my old Gaffer!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}别垂死挣扎了，小东西\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我要在你身上刺个透明窟窿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我先要你的命\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not if I stick you first.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}山姆！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sam!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}山姆，对不起\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我真是对不起你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sorry for everything.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}-我先把你救出去  -太迟了，一切都完了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Let's get you out of here.  -It's too late. It's over.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他们把它拿走了，山姆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They've taken it, Sam.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他们把魔戒拿走了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They took the Ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}放心，他们并没有\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Begging your pardon, but they haven't.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我以为你死了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I thought I'd lost you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}所以我就把它拿走\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So I took it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我只是保管它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Only for safekeeping.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}把它给我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Give it to me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}把魔戒给我，山姆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Give me the Ring, Sam.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}山姆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sam.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}把魔戒交给我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Give me the Ring.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你必须明白\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You must understand.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}魔戒是我的责任\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Ring is my burden.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}它会毁了你，山姆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It will destroy you, Sam.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}来吧，弗罗多先生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come on, Mr. Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你最好找件衣服穿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We best find you some clothes.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你可不能光着身子去魔多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You can't go walking through Mordor in naught but your skin.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们到了，弗罗多先生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We did it, Mr. Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们终于到了魔多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We made it to Mordor.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}有好多敌人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There are so many of them.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们一定会被发现\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We'll never get through unseen.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}是他，邪眼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's him, the Eye.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们非去不可，弗罗多先生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}没别的选择\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's nothing for it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}来吧，先下了山再说\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come on. Let's just make it down the hill for starters.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我看不到弗罗多的行踪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo has passed beyond my sight.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}黑暗笼罩大地\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The darkness is deepening.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}如果魔戒被索伦夺取，我们会得知消息\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这是迟早的事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's only a matter of time.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他是吃了场败仗，是的，但是\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He has suffered a defeat, yes but
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他正在魔多重新集结大军\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	behind the walls of Mordor, our enemy is regrouping.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}让他留在那里吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let him stay there.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}让他去死吧！我们为什么要怕他？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let him rot! Why should we care?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}因为有一万名半兽人会阻止弗罗多前往末日火山\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Because 10,000 Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我等于是让他去送死\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I've sent him to his death.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}不\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}弗罗多仍有一线希望\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There is still hope for Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他需要时间穿越苟格罗斯平原\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He needs time and safe passage across the plains of Gorgoroth.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}-我们能替他争取时间  -怎么争取？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-We can give him that.  -How?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}把索伦的大军引出来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Draw out Sauron's armies.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}让魔多变成空城\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Empty his lands.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}然后我们以全部兵力攻打黑门\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们的兵力不能打败敌人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们不必打败他们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not for ourselves.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}只要让索伦心无旁骛，专心地对付我们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}弗罗多就有成功的机会\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Keep him blind to all else that moves.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}声东击西\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A diversion.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}成功机率很小\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Certainty of death,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}几乎是去送死\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	small chance of success,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们还在等什么？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	what are we waiting for?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}索伦一定会起疑心\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sauron will suspect a trap.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他不会轻易上当\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He will not take the bait.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}不，我想他会上当\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, I think he will.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你猎杀我太久太久了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Long have you hunted me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我也躲着你太久太久了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Long have I eluded you.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我不想再躲下去了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No more.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}看我的伊伦迪尔圣剑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Behold the Sword of Elendil.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}整座城市静悄悄的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The city has fallen silent.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}太阳没有一丝暖意\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There is no warmth left in the sun.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}空气越来越冷\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It grows so cold.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}下了第一阵春雨才会这么潮湿冰冷\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's just the damp of the first spring rain.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我相信黑暗很快就会过去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I do not believe this darkness will endure.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你看，那些半兽人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Look, the Orcs,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他们走了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	they're moving off.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你看吧，弗罗多先生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You see, Mr. Frodo,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们终于有好运气了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	some luck at last.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}动作快点，懒虫！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Move it, you slugs!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}快点！快点！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come on! Faster!

	It's so heavy.

	Oh, no.

	Get off of me!

	Hurry up
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我不行了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I can't.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我承受不了魔戒的压力，山姆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I can't manage the Ring, Sam.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}它真的太重了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's such a weight to carry.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}重到让人受不了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	such a weight.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们要走那里，尽量走直线\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We're going that way. Straight as we can.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}不需要的东西都不带了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's no point carrying anything we're not sure to need.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}弗罗多先生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mr. Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你看\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Look.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}上面有光亮\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There is light
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}好耀眼的光芒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and beauty up there
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}没有任何阴影能盖住它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	that no shadow can touch.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}喝我的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Take mine.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}里面还有几滴水\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's a few drops left.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}可是回去就没水喝了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There will be none left for the return journey.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我想我们是回不去了，弗罗多先生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't think there will be a return journey, Mr. Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}弗罗多，快趴下！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo, get down!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}快躲起来！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hide!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}弗罗多！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他们在哪里？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Where are they?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}黑暗魔君快现身！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我要让他就地伏法！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let justice be done upon him!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我的主人，伟大的魔君索伦欢迎你们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My master, Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你们哪一位可以代表跟我谈判？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们不是来跟索伦谈判的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We do not come to treat with Sauron,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}那个受诅咒的恶魔\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	faithless and accursed.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}告诉你的主子，魔多大军必须解散\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Tell your master this, The armies of Mordor must disband.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他要滚出中土世界，永远不再回来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He is to depart these lands, never to return.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}灰胡子老爹\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Old Greybeard.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我有一件信物要给你看\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have a token I was bidden to show thee.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}弗罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}-安静  -不！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Silence.  -No!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}安静！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Silence!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}原来那个半身人对你们这么重要\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}他在我们手上受了很痛苦的折磨\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}谁会料到这么小的身躯能忍受这么大的痛苦？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Who would've thought one so small could endure so much pain?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}而他做到了，但被折磨的不成人形，甘道夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And he did, Gandalf.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}痛苦不堪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He did.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}这又是谁？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And who is this?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}埃西铎的子嗣？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Isildur's heir?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}想要当国王光有一把破烂的精灵宝剑还不够\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It takes more to make a king than a broken Elvish blade.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我猜我们的谈判结束了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I guess that concludes negotiations.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我不信\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I do not believe it.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我不相信\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I will not.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}往后退\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Pull back.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}往后退！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Pull back!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}它走了，弗罗多先生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's gone, Mr. Frodo.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}那道光移到北面去了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The light's passed on, away towards the north.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}它被什么引开了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Something's drawn its gaze.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}稳住阵线！稳住阵线！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hold your ground! Hold your ground!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}刚铎和洛汗的好男儿！我的好兄弟！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我在你们眼中看到恐惧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I see in your eyes,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我内心中也充满着同样的恐惧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	the same fear that would take the heart of me.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}有一天，人类将失去勇气\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A day may come when the courage of Men fails,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我们会众叛亲离，一败涂地\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}但那不会是在今天！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But it is not this day！
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}有一天，邪将胜正\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	An hour of wolves and shattered shields,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}人类的世界也会完全毁灭\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	when the age of Men comes crashing down.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}但那不会是在今天！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But it is not this day！
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}今天，我们要誓死奋战！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This day we fight!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}为了你们在世上所珍惜的一切\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	By all that you hold dear on this good earth,
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}一定要奋战到底，西方的人类！\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I bid you stand, Men of the West!
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我从来没想过我会跟一个精灵一起战死\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an Elf.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}那和一个朋友一起战死呢？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What about side by side with a friend?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Aye.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我愿意\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I could do that.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}弗罗多先生，你还记得夏尔吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}春天就要来到了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It'll be spring soon.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}果树也都要开花了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And the orchards will be in blossom.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}鸟儿会在榛树上筑巢\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}人们很快就要收割大麦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And they'll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}沾鲜奶油吃初摘的草莓\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and eating the first of the strawberries with cream.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}你还记得草莓的味道吗？\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do you remember the taste of strawberries?
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}不，山姆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No, Sam.
	{\3c&H6C3300&}{\b1}{\fs18}我不记得食物的味道\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I can't recall the taste of food,

	Then let us be rid of it,

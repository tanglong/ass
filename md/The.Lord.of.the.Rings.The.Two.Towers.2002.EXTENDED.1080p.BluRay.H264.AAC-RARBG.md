	小心 不然哈比人会跌进去成为死亡的一员\N
	Careful now! Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones...
	自己也会点亮一个小小的鬼火\N
	...and light little candles of their own.

	这些足迹很奇怪\N
	These are strange tracks.
	这里的空气令人窒息\N
	The air is so close in here.
	这座森林很古老\N
	This forest is old.
	非常古老\N
	Very old.
	充满了记忆\N
	Full of memory...
	还有愤怒\N
	...and anger.
	这些树在互相交谈\N
	The trees are speaking to each other.
	金雳!\N

	除了松鼠不停的摘果子的事以外\N
	Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
	白袍巫师来了\N
	The White Wizard approaches.
	别让他说话 他会对我们下咒\N
	Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us.
	动作要快\N
	We must be quick.
	你们在找两个小哈比人\N
	You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
	他们在哪儿?\N
	Where are they?
	他们前天从这里走过\N
	They passed this way the day before yesterday.
	他们遇到了你们想不到的人\N
	They met someone they did not expect.
	这下你们高兴了?\N
	Does that comfort you?
	你是谁?\N
	Who are you?
	快现身!\N
	Show yourself!
	不可能\N
	It cannot be.
	原谅我\N
	Forgive me.
	我把你错认为萨鲁曼\N
	I mistook you for Saruman.
	我是萨鲁曼\N
	I am Saruman.
	或者说是应该是那样子的萨鲁曼\N
	Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
	你跌下去\N
	You fell.
	跌入火海\N
	Through fire...
	和深水\N

	我从最深的地心到最高的山峰\N

	和魔尔斯的炎魔展开殊死战\N
	...I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
	直到我击败强敌\N
	Until at last I threw down my enemy...
	把他的尸身丢到山下\N
	...and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
	我被黑暗吞蚀\N
	Darkness took me...
	不知道失去意识多久\N
	...and I strayed out of thought and time.
	日换星移\N
	Stars wheeled overhead...
	每一天都像一辈子一样漫长\N
	...and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
	但是这并不是终结\N
	But It was not the end.
	我终于重获新生\N
	I felt life In me again.
	我被送回来\N
	I've been sent back...
	完成使命\N
	...until my task is done.
	甘道夫?\N
	Gandalf.
	甘道夫?\N
	Gandalf?
	是的\N
	Yes.
	以前人家是叫我甘道夫\N
	That was what they used to call me.
	灰袍巫师甘道夫\N
	Gandalf the Grey.
	那是我以前的名字\N
	That was my name.
	甘道夫\N
	Gandalf.
	我现在是白袍巫师甘道夫\N
	I am Gandalf the White.
	我在危急时刻回来帮助你们\N
	And I come back to you now...
	来扭转乾坤\N
	...at the turn of the tide.
	你们的旅程开启了全新的一页\N
	One stage of your journey is over. Another begins.
	- 我们必须尽快赶到伊多拉斯     - 伊多拉斯?\N
	- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.     - Edoras?
	这段路可不短!\N
	That is no short distance!
	我们听说洛汗国出事了  国王生病了\N
	We hear of trouble in Rohan. It goes ill with the king.
	是的  而且病得很重\N
	Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
	那我们要白跑一趟了?\N
	Then we have run all this way for nothing?
	我们要把那些可怜的小矮人留在这\N
	Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...
	可怕  漆黑而又阴冷的树林里?\N
	...in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?
	我指的是这迷人的\N
	I mean, charming...
	非常迷人的森林\N
	...quite charming forest.
	我们只有一点点机会把梅里和皮聘带到法贡森林去\N
	It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
	一种很强大的力量已经在这里沉睡了很多年\N
	A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
	梅里和皮聘的到来就像一块小石子的滑落\N
	The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones...
	会引发山里的大雪崩\N
	...that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
	有一件事你还没改变  亲爱的朋友\N
	In one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
	你还是爱打谜\N
	You still speak in riddles.
	一件事情就要发生  但是自古以来一直还没有发生\N
	A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
	树人们就要醒来了\N
	The Ents are going to wake up...
	- 而且会发现他们很强大     - 强大?!\N
	- and find that they are strong.     - Strong?!
	哦  这可不错\N
	Oh, that's good.
	所以不要焦虑  矮人主人\N
	So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
	梅里和皮聘非常安全\N
	Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
	事实上  他们比你要安全得多\N
	In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
	这个新的甘道夫比老的要暴躁得多\N
	This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
	它是一匹米亚拉斯神驹\N
	That is one of the Mearas...
	除非我的双眼被符咒迷惑\N
	...unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
	它是影疾\N
	Shadowfax.
	它是马中之王\N
	He is the lord of all horses...
	跟我一起经历了很多危险\N
	...and has been my friend through many dangers.
	哦  我的山犁花\N
	Orowan mine
	我见到你闪耀\N
	I saw you shine
	在一个炎炎夏日\N
	Upon a summer's day
	在你的头上高高戴着的皇冠\N
	Upon your head How golden-red
	是多么的金红\N
	The crown you bore aloft
	美丽的诗句\N
	Such a beautiful verse.
	- 更远了吗?      - 不要匆忙\N
	- Is it much further?     - Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.
	也许你可以称它为远\N
	You might call it far, perhaps.
	我的家在森林深处\N
	My home lies deep in the forest...
	靠近山脚的地方\N
	...near the roots of the mountain.
	我答应甘道夫保护你们安全\N
	I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
	我一定会好好保护你们\N
	And safe is where I'll keep you.
	我相信你们也会喜欢下一个的\N
	I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
	是我自己的作品\N
	It's one of my own compositions.
	没错\N
	Right.
	在沉睡的树叶铺盖的屋顶下\N
	Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
	在那张开的树木的梦里\N
	And the dreams of trees unfold
	当森林的殿堂荫绿清凉的时候\N
	When woodland halls are green and cool
	当风儿向西吹的时候\N
	And the wind is In the West
	回到我身边\N
	Come back to me
	回到我身边\N
	Come back to me
	说我的土地是最好的\N
	And say my land is best
	睡吧  小夏尔\N
	Sleep, little Shirelings.
	不要理会夜晚的声音\N
	Heed no nightly noise.
	一直睡到清晨\N
	Sleep till morning light.
	我有事要去森林里\N
	I have business in the forest.
	要叫许多人  许多人必须来\N
	There are many to call. Many that must come.
	阴影对法贡森林的事撒谎了\N
	The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
	树林的枯萎越来越近了\N
	The withering of all woods is drawing near.
	东部怒目而视的影子不断发展\N
	The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
	所罗会因为没有对手而痛苦\N
	Sauron will suffer no rival.
	从巴拉多的顶锋他不断地观望着\N
	From the summit of Barad-dur, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
	但是他还不是最强大的人  以至无所畏惧\N
	But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
	疑惑一直侵蚀着他\N
	Doubt ever gnaws at him.
	谣言已经传到他那里\N
	The rumor has reached him.
	努曼诺尔的后嗣依然活着\N
	The heir of Numenor still lives.
	所罗害怕你  亚拉冈\N
	Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
	他害怕你将成为的人物\N
	He fears what you may become.
	所以他会快速而且猛烈地打击人类世界\N
	And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
	他会利用他的傀儡萨鲁曼来毁灭洛汗国\N
	He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
	战争就要降临了\N
	War is coming.
	洛汗国必须保卫自己  我们为洛汗国的挑战\N
	Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge...
	是弱小的  我们准备好牺牲了\N
	...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
	国王的思想被束缚了  他只是一个萨鲁曼老装置了\N
	The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
	他现在对国王希优顿控制非常强\N
	His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
	所罗和萨鲁曼正在勒紧绳索\N
	Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
	但是对于他们所有的诡计\N
	But for all their cunning...
	我们还有一个优势\N
	...we have one advantage.
	就是魔戒仍然隐藏着\N
	The Ring remains hidden.
	所以我们应该找到并毁灭它\N
	And that we should seek to destroy it...
	还没有进入他们最黑暗的梦境\N
	...has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
	所以哈比人拿着敌人的武器正在向魔多进发\N
	And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
	离末日山一天天逼近\N
	Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
	现在我们必须相信佛罗多\N
	We must trust now in Frodo.
	一切取决于速度\N
	Everything depends upon speed...
	还需对他的要求保守秘密\N
	...and the secrecy of his quest.
	你不要后悔做出留下他的决定\N
	Do not regret your decision to leave him.
	佛罗多必须独自完成这个任务\N
	Frodo must finish this task alone.
	他并不是一个人\N
	He's not alone.
	山姆跟着他\N
	Sam went with him.
	真的吗?\N
	Did he?
	真是这样? 太好了\N
	Did he, indeed? Good.
	对  非常好\N
	Yes, very good.
	魔多的黑门\N
	The Black Gate of Mordor.
	我的天\N
	Oh, save us.
	如果我老爸现在看到我们一定会说上两句的\N
	My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
	主人要我带他到魔多\N
	Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
	史麦戈就乖乖带主人去\N
	So good Smeagol does, master says so.
	我是这样做的\N
	I did.
	没错\N
	That's it, then.
	我们闯不进去\N
	We can't get past that.
	看!\N
	Look!
	你看城门\N
	The gate.
	它打开了!\N
	It's opening!
	我能看见下面的路\N
	I can see a way down.

	Sam, no!
	主人!\N
	Master!
	- 我并没有要你跟我进去  山姆     - 我知道  佛罗多先生\N
	- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.     - I know, Mr. Frodo.
	我怀疑到里面披精灵斗蓬也没有用\N
	I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
	- 去吧!     - 不!\N
	- Now!      - No!
	不行 主人!\N
	No! No, master!
	他们会抓到你的! 他们会抓到你的!\N
	They catch you! They catch you!
	别把它交给他了\N
	Don't take it to him.
	他想要宝贝\N
	He wants the precious.
	他一直在找它\N
	Always he is looking for it.
	宝贝也想回到他手上\N
	And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
	但是我们不能让他拿去\N
	But we mustn't let him have it.
	不行 有另一条路\N
	No! There's another way.
	更隐密  更黑暗的路\N
	More secret. A dark way.
	- 你为什么不早说?     - 因为主人没有问\N
	- Why haven't you spoken of this before?     - Because master did not ask.
	他在动歪脑筋\N
	He's up to something.
	你是说有另一条路到魔多?\N
	Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
	对 有一条小路\N
	Yes. There's a path...
	和一些阶梯\N
	...and some stairs.
	然后\N
	And then...
	有一条隧道\N
	...a tunnel.
	他都带我们到这儿了  山姆\N
	He's led us this far, Sam.
	佛罗多先生 不行\N
	Mr. Frodo, no.
	他信守他的诺言\N
	He's been true to his word.
	不要\N
	No.
	带路吧 史麦戈\N
	Lead the way, Smeagol.
	史麦戈总是很乐意帮忙\N
	Good Smeagol always helps.
	喂?\N
	Hello?
	树须?\N
	Treebeard?
	他去哪了?\N
	Where has he gone?
	昨天晚上我做了一个最美妙的梦\N
	I had the loveliest dream last night.
	那有一个大桶  里面装满了烟叶\N
	There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.

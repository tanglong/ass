	I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
	回到阴影处\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Go back to the Shadow.
	黑暗之火对你不利 乌顿之火!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
	你不能过来!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You shall not pass!

	甘道夫!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gandalf!
	快走啊 你这傻瓜\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	佛罗多先生 怎么了?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What is it, Mr. Frodo?
	没什么\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Nothing.
	只是做了个梦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Just a dream.
	你能看到底吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Can you see the bottom?
	别! 别往下看  山姆! 继续走!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No! Don't look down, Sam! Just keep going!
	抓住! 抓住! 佛罗多先生!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
	佛罗多先生!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mr. Frodo!
	我想我们找到底部了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I think I've found the bottom.
	沼泽和绳索 天知道\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
	这不自然  所有这些!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's not natural. None of it.
	- 这里面有什么?     - 没什么\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- What's in this?     - Nothing.
	只是一些调味品\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Just a bit of seasoning.
	我在想如果我们某天晚上有只烤鸡什么的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
	烤鸡?!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Roast chicken?!
	你永远不知道会发生什么\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You never know.
	山姆  我亲爱的山姆!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sam. My dear Sam.
	那很特别 这是所有郡里最好的盐\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's very special, that. It's the best salt in all the Shire.
	是很特别\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It is special.
	有些像家乡的盐\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's a little bit of home.
	我们不能把这些留下来 否则会有人跟着我们下来的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
	谁会跟我们下来 佛罗多先生?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
	真的很令人遗憾  那是凯兰崔尔女王给我的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's a shame, really. Lady Galadriel gave me that.
	真正的精灵绳索\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Real Elvish rope.
	嗯 反正这个绳索也是白给的 倒的确是我打的结\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Well, there's nothing for it. It's one of my knots.
	这个可不是轻易能够得到的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Won't come free in a hurry.
	不愧是真正的精灵绳索\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Real Elvish rope.
	魔多--一个我们不愿意靠近看的世界\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
	却是我们试图去的地方\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
	只是 我们不可能到那里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's just where we can't get.
	我们面对现实吧  佛罗多先生  我们迷路了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
	我想甘道夫的意思不是让我们这样做\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
	他也不想让其他很多事发生  山姆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam...
	但是还是发生了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...but they did.
	佛罗多先生?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mr. Frodo?
	是因为那魔戒 没错吧?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's the Ring, isn't it?
	它越来越有分量了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's getting heavier.
	- 我们还剩什么吃的?     - 让我看看\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- What food have we got left?     - Let me see.
	有了 棒呆了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, yes. Lovely.
	兰巴斯干粮 你瞧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Lembas bread. And look!
	更多的兰巴斯干粮\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	More lembas bread.
	通常我不太爱吃怪东西\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't usually hold with foreign food...
	不过这种精灵干粮吃起来还不错\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
	什么都不能影响你的心情 是不是 山姆?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
	那些乌云就能\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Those rain clouds might.
	这地方好眼熟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This looks strangely familiar.
	那是因为我们来过了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's because we've been here before.
	我们在兜圈子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We're going in circles.
	什么味道那么臭?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What is that horrid stink?
	我打赌附近一定有沼泽\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
	- 你闻得到吗?     - 可以\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Can you smell it?     - Yes.
	我闻到了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I can smell it.
	这儿还有别人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We're not alone.
	小偷 那些小偷\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The thieves. The thieves.
	那些臭小偷\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The filthy little thieves.
	它在哪里?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Where is it?
	在哪里?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Where is it?
	他们从我们这里把它偷走\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They stole it from us.
	我的宝物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My precious.
	诅咒他们 我们恨他们!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Curse them, we hates them!
	那是我们的 我们要拿回!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
	这是针刺宝剑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This is Sting.
	你以前也看过它...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You've seen it before...
	对吧 咕鲁?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...haven't you, Gollum?
	放开他 否则我就割断你喉咙\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Release him or I'll cut your throat.
	像火烧的一样疼!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It burns!
	烧死我们了!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It burns us!
	好冰哦!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It freezes!
	臭精灵打造的绳子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Nasty Elves twisted it.
	- 快帮我们解开!     - 给我闭嘴!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Take it off us!     - Quiet, you!
	这样不行 魔多的半兽人会听到他鬼叫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
	- 把他绑起来 留在这儿     - 别!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Let's just tie him up and leave him.     - No!
	那样我们会死的! 会死的!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That would kill us! Kill us!
	你死了是活该!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's no more than you deserve!
	也许他的确该死\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Maybe he does deserve to die.
	不过当我看到他 倒是觉得他很可怜\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But now that I see him, I do pity him.
	我们对他们好 他们一定会报答\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
	快帮我们解开\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Take it off us.
	我们发誓会按你的吩咐去办事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We swears to do what you wants.
	我们对天发誓\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We swears.
	你发的誓根本不能让我相信\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
	我们发誓...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We swears...
	服侍宝物的主人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...to serve the master of the precious.
	我愿意对...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We will swear on...
	宝物发誓\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...on the precious.
	咕鲁 咕鲁\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gollum. Gollum.
	摩戒是很有魔力的 会迫使你守信的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word.
	是的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes...
	神圣的宝物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...on the precious.
	神圣的宝物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	On the precious.
	我不相信你!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't believe you!
	- 下来 快下来!     - 山姆!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Get down! I said, down!     - Sam!
	他想要骗我们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's trying to trick us.
	如果我们让他走  他会趁我们熟睡时偷袭我们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
	- 你知道去魔多的路吗?      - 知道\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- You know the way to Mordor?     - Yes.
	你去过那儿?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You've been there before?
	去过\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes.
	你必须带我们到那个黑门\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You will lead us to the Black Gate.
	到黑门  到黑门!到黑门  主人说了  对!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	To the Gate, to the Gate! To the Gate, the master says. Yes!
	不行!我们不能去 不去那里 不去他那\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No! We won't go back. Not there. Not to him.
	他们不能强迫我们 咕鲁!咕鲁!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!
	但是我们发誓服侍宝物的主人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
	不行  那里满天灰烬  炙热如火还有无尽的深渊\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
	还有半兽人  成千上万的半兽人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
	邪眼一直在监视着\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
	嘿!快回来!回来!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hey! Come back now! Come back!
	我告诉过你什么\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There! What did I tell you?
	他跑掉了  那个坏东西\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's run off, the old villain.
	他的承诺到此为止了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So much for his promises.
	这边  霍比特人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This way, Hobbits.

	Merry!
	你来迟了  我们的主人不耐烦了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You're late. Our master grows impatient.
	他现在就想要那些"老鼠"\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He wants the Shire-rats now.
	我没有从兽人首领那里得到命令\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
	萨鲁曼会得到他的战利品的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Saruman will have his prize.
	我们会负责运送的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We will deliver them.
	梅里!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Merry!

	He needs water. Please!
	他病了? 给他点药  小伙子们!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	住手\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Stop it!
	受不了他喝的水?!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Can't take his draught!
	- 让他一个人呆着!     - 为什么?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Leave him alone!     - Why?
	你也想来点?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You want some?
	那就闭上你的嘴\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Then keep your mouth shut.
	梅里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Merry.

	Hello, Pip.
	- 你受伤了     - 我很好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- You're hurt.     - I'm fine.
	- 我只是假装     - 假装?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- It was just an act.     - An act?
	瞧  我连你也给糊弄了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	See? I fooled you too.
	别为我担心 皮聘\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Don't worry about me, Pippin.
	是什么? 你闻到了什么?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What is it? What do you smell?
	人的味道\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Man-flesh.
	他们追上来了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They've picked up our trail.
	亚拉冈\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Aragorn.
	我们快走!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let's move!
	他们加快了脚步\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Their pace has quickened.
	他们一定是闻到我们了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They must have caught our scent.
	快呀!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hurry!
	快呀 金雳\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come on, Gimli!
	已经追了三天三夜了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Three days and nights pursuit.
	没吃饭 也没休息\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No food. No rest.
	仍然没有他们的踪迹 但这些坚硬的石头能给什么线索\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
	哈比人的叶形胸针不会无缘无故的掉在这里的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
	他们可能还活着\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They may yet be alive.
	离我们只有不到一天路程 来吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Less than a day ahead of us. Come.
	快点 金雳  就快赶上他们了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!
	长途跋涉我可最不在行  矮人族是天生短跑健将\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm wasted on cross-country. We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
	但短距离非常危险\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Very dangerous over short distances.
	洛汗\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Rohan.
	骠骑之乡\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Home of the Horse-lords.
	事情有些不对劲\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's something strange at work here.
	有些邪恶之物将这里的生物都吓走了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
	他们想对付我们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sets its will against us.
	勒苟拉斯! 你的精灵之眼能看到什么?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?
	强兽人转往东北方了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Uruks turn northeast.
	他们要将哈比人带到艾辛格\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
	萨鲁曼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	Together, my Lord Sauron...
	就能统治整个世界\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...we shall rule this Middle-earth.
	旧世界将被工业之火吞蚀\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Old World will burn in the fires of Industry.
	森林将被夷为平地\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The forests will fall.
	一股新势力将崛起\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A new order will rise.
	我们将以半兽人的坚甲利兵\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear...
	发动千军万马的进行战争\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...and the Iron flsts of the Orc.
	我要他们准备好在两周内行军!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
	但是  主人  他们人太多了!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But, my lord, there are too many!
	他们没办法按时将他们装备好 我们办不到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
	造筑水坝  阻挡河流  修建熔炉\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
	我们没有足够的燃料来生火\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	法贡森林就在我们门口\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
	- 烧了它     - 好的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Burn it.     - Yes.
	我们会为你而战\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We will fight for you.
	向我发誓\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Swear it.
	我们愿为萨鲁曼而死\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We will die for Saruman.
	骠骑国人民强占你们的土地\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Horse-Men took your lands.
	他们把你们赶到山上 把你们推下山\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
	凶手!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	We have only to remove those who oppose us.
	洛汗是第一个目标\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It will begin in Rohan.
	这些农夫一直和你作对\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Too long have these peasants stood against you.
	但不会再继续了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	You take your sister. You'll go faster with just two.
	爸爸说伊欧参不能骑加夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
	它太高大了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	没错\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes.
	宝物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Precious.
	一旦它完全的支配了我们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Once it takes hold of us...
	就永远分不开了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...it never lets go.
	不要碰我!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Don't touch me!
	那里有死了的东西!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There are dead things!
	水里有死人脸\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Dead faces in the water.
	都死了 都烂掉了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	All dead. All rotten.
	精灵  人类和半兽人都一样\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Elves and Men and Orcses.
	很久以前这儿有一场大战\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A great battle long ago.
	死亡沼泽\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Dead Marshes.
	没错 没错 这就是它的名字\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes. Yes, that is their name.
	走这边\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This way.
	别跟着鬼火\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Don't follow the lights.
	小心 不然哈比人会跌进去成为死亡的一员\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Careful now! Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones...
	自己也会点亮一个小小的鬼火\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...and light little candles of their own.
	佛罗多!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo!
	- 咕鲁?     - 别跟着鬼火\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Gollum?     - Don't follow the lights.
	- 咕鲁!     - 佛罗多先生!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Gollum!     - Mr. Frodo!
	你没事吧?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Are you all right?
	多么金光闪烁!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So bright.
	多么美丽啊!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So beautiful.
	我们的宝物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Our precious.
	你在说什么?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What did you say?
	主人应该休息了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Master should be resting.
	主人一定要保存体力\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Master needs to keep up his strength.
	- 你是谁?     - 别问我们 这不关你事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Who are you?     - Mustn't ask us. Not its business.
	咕鲁 咕鲁\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gollum. Gollum.
	甘道夫说你曾是住河边的哈比人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
	我们离乡背井 冰透心 寒彻骨\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Cold be heart and hand and bone. Cold be travelers far from home
	他说你的一生很悲惨\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He said your life was a sad story.
	他们没看到在太阳落下 月亮死亡的前面还有什么\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They do not see what lies ahead When sun has falled and moon is dead
	你和以前的哈比人没有什么区别\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
	是吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Were you?
	史麦戈\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Smeagol.
	你叫我什么?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What did you call me?
	那曾经是你的名字 对吧?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That was your name once, wasn't it?
	那是很久以前的事了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A long time ago.
	我的名字\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My name.
	我的名字\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My name.
	史麦戈\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Smeagol.
	黑骑士!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Black Riders!
	快躲! 快躲!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hide! Hide!
	起来 佛罗多  快点!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come on, Frodo. Come on!
	快! 他们会看到我们的! 他们会看到我们的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Quick! They will see us! They will see us!
	- 我以为他们死了     - 死?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- I thought they were dead.     - Dead?
	不  你是杀不了他们的  不可能\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No, you cannot kill them. No.

	Wraiths!
	骑着飞兽的戒灵!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Wraiths on wings!
	他们在召唤它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They are calling for it.
	他们在召唤宝物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They are calling for the precious.
	佛罗多先生 没事了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mr. Frodo! It's all right.
	我在这儿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm here.
	快走吧 哈比人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hurry, Hobbits.
	黑门就快到了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Black Gate is very close.
	半兽人的血\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Orc blood.
	这些足迹很奇怪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	These are strange tracks.
	这里的空气令人窒息\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The air is so close in here.
	这座森林很古老\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This forest is old.
	非常古老\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Very old.
	充满了记忆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Full of memory...
	还有愤怒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...and anger.
	这些树在互相交谈\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The trees are speaking to each other.
	金雳!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gimli!
	把斧子放下来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Lower your ax.
	他们有情感  我的朋友\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They have feelings, my friend.
	是精灵起源\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Elves began it.
	叫醒树木 教他们说话\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
	会说话的树\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Talking trees.
	树必须谈些什么?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What do trees have to talk about?
	除了松鼠不停的摘果子的事以外\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
	白袍巫师来了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The White Wizard approaches.
	别让他说话 他会对我们下咒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us.
	动作要快\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We must be quick.
	你们在找两个小哈比人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
	他们在哪儿?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Where are they?
	他们前天从这里走过\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They passed this way the day before yesterday.
	他们遇到了你们想不到的人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They met someone they did not expect.
	这下你们高兴了?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Does that comfort you?
	你是谁?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Who are you?
	快现身!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Show yourself!
	不可能\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It cannot be.
	原谅我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Forgive me.
	我把你错认为萨鲁曼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I mistook you for Saruman.
	我是萨鲁曼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I am Saruman.
	或者说是应该是那样子的萨鲁曼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
	你跌下去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You fell.
	跌入火海\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Through fire...
	和深水\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...and water.
	我从最深的地心到最高的山峰\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...
	和魔尔斯的炎魔展开殊死战\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
	直到我击败强敌\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Until at last I threw down my enemy...
	把他的尸身丢到山下\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
	我被黑暗吞蚀\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Darkness took me...
	不知道失去意识多久\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...and I strayed out of thought and time.
	日换星移\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Stars wheeled overhead...
	每一天都像一辈子一样漫长\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
	但是这并不是终结\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But It was not the end.
	我终于重获新生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I felt life In me again.
	我被送回来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I've been sent back...
	完成使命\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...until my task is done.
	甘道夫?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gandalf.
	甘道夫?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gandalf?
	是的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes.
	以前人家是叫我甘道夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That was what they used to call me.
	灰袍巫师甘道夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gandalf the Grey.
	那是我以前的名字\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That was my name.
	甘道夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gandalf.
	我现在是白袍巫师甘道夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I am Gandalf the White.
	我在危急时刻回来帮助你们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And I come back to you now...
	来扭转乾坤\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...at the turn of the tide.
	你们的旅程开启了全新的一页\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	One stage of your journey is over. Another begins.
	- 我们必须尽快赶到伊多拉斯     - 伊多拉斯?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.     - Edoras?
	这段路可不短!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That is no short distance!
	我们听说洛汗国出事了  国王生病了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We hear of trouble in Rohan. It goes ill with the king.
	是的  而且病得很重\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
	那我们要白跑一趟了?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Then we have run all this way for nothing?
	我们要把那些可怜的小矮人留在这\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...
	可怕  漆黑而又阴冷的树林里?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?
	我指的是这迷人的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I mean, charming...
	非常迷人的森林\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...quite charming forest.
	我们只有一点点机会把梅里和皮聘带到法贡森林去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
	一种很强大的力量已经在这里沉睡了很多年\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
	梅里和皮聘的到来就像一块小石子的滑落\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones...
	会引发山里的大雪崩\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
	有一件事你还没改变  亲爱的朋友\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	In one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
	你还是爱打谜\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You still speak in riddles.
	一件事情就要发生  但是自古以来一直还没有发生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
	树人们就要醒来了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Ents are going to wake up...
	- 而且会发现他们很强大     - 强大?!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- and find that they are strong.     - Strong?!
	哦  这可不错\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, that's good.
	所以不要焦虑  矮人主人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
	梅里和皮聘非常安全\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
	事实上  他们比你要安全得多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
	这个新的甘道夫比老的要暴躁得多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
	它是一匹米亚拉斯神驹\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That is one of the Mearas...
	除非我的双眼被符咒迷惑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
	它是影疾\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Shadowfax.
	它是马中之王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He is the lord of all horses...
	跟我一起经历了很多危险\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...and has been my friend through many dangers.
	哦  我的山犁花\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Orowan mine
	我见到你闪耀\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I saw you shine
	在一个炎炎夏日\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Upon a summer's day
	在你的头上高高戴着的皇冠\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Upon your head How golden-red
	是多么的金红\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The crown you bore aloft
	美丽的诗句\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Such a beautiful verse.
	- 更远了吗?      - 不要匆忙\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Is it much further?     - Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.
	也许你可以称它为远\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You might call it far, perhaps.
	我的家在森林深处\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My home lies deep in the forest...
	靠近山脚的地方\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...near the roots of the mountain.
	我答应甘道夫保护你们安全\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
	我一定会好好保护你们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And safe is where I'll keep you.
	我相信你们也会喜欢下一个的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
	是我自己的作品\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's one of my own compositions.
	没错\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Right.
	在沉睡的树叶铺盖的屋顶下\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
	在那张开的树木的梦里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And the dreams of trees unfold
	当森林的殿堂荫绿清凉的时候\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	When woodland halls are green and cool
	当风儿向西吹的时候\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And the wind is In the West
	回到我身边\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come back to me
	回到我身边\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come back to me
	说我的土地是最好的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And say my land is best
	睡吧  小夏尔\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sleep, little Shirelings.
	不要理会夜晚的声音\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Heed no nightly noise.
	一直睡到清晨\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sleep till morning light.
	我有事要去森林里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have business in the forest.
	要叫许多人  许多人必须来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There are many to call. Many that must come.
	阴影对法贡森林的事撒谎了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
	树林的枯萎越来越近了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The withering of all woods is drawing near.
	东部怒目而视的影子不断发展\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
	所罗会因为没有对手而痛苦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sauron will suffer no rival.
	从巴拉多的顶锋他不断地观望着\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	From the summit of Barad-dur, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
	但是他还不是最强大的人  以至无所畏惧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
	疑惑一直侵蚀着他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Doubt ever gnaws at him.
	谣言已经传到他那里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The rumor has reached him.
	努曼诺尔的后嗣依然活着\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The heir of Numenor still lives.
	所罗害怕你  亚拉冈\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
	他害怕你将成为的人物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He fears what you may become.
	所以他会快速而且猛烈地打击人类世界\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
	他会利用他的傀儡萨鲁曼来毁灭洛汗国\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
	战争就要降临了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	War is coming.
	洛汗国必须保卫自己  我们为洛汗国的挑战\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge...
	是弱小的  我们准备好牺牲了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
	国王的思想被束缚了  他只是一个萨鲁曼老装置了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
	他现在对国王希优顿控制非常强\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
	所罗和萨鲁曼正在勒紧绳索\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
	但是对于他们所有的诡计\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But for all their cunning...
	我们还有一个优势\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...we have one advantage.
	就是魔戒仍然隐藏着\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Ring remains hidden.
	所以我们应该找到并毁灭它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And that we should seek to destroy it...
	还没有进入他们最黑暗的梦境\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
	所以哈比人拿着敌人的武器正在向魔多进发\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
	离末日山一天天逼近\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
	现在我们必须相信佛罗多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We must trust now in Frodo.
	一切取决于速度\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Everything depends upon speed...
	还需对他的要求保守秘密\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...and the secrecy of his quest.
	你不要后悔做出留下他的决定\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do not regret your decision to leave him.
	佛罗多必须独自完成这个任务\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Frodo must finish this task alone.
	他并不是一个人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's not alone.
	山姆跟着他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sam went with him.
	真的吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Did he?
	真是这样? 太好了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Did he, indeed? Good.
	对  非常好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes, very good.
	魔多的黑门\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Black Gate of Mordor.
	我的天\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, save us.
	如果我老爸现在看到我们一定会说上两句的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
	主人要我带他到魔多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
	史麦戈就乖乖带主人去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So good Smeagol does, master says so.
	我是这样做的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I did.
	没错\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's it, then.
	我们闯不进去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We can't get past that.
	看!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Look!
	你看城门\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The gate.
	它打开了!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's opening!
	我能看见下面的路\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I can see a way down.
	山姆 不!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sam, no!
	主人!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Master!
	- 我并没有要你跟我进去  山姆     - 我知道  佛罗多先生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.     - I know, Mr. Frodo.
	我怀疑到里面披精灵斗蓬也没有用\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
	- 去吧!     - 不!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Now!      - No!
	不行 主人!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No! No, master!
	他们会抓到你的! 他们会抓到你的!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They catch you! They catch you!
	别把它交给他了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Don't take it to him.
	他想要宝贝\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He wants the precious.
	他一直在找它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Always he is looking for it.
	宝贝也想回到他手上\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
	但是我们不能让他拿去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But we mustn't let him have it.
	不行 有另一条路\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No! There's another way.
	更隐密  更黑暗的路\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	More secret. A dark way.
	- 你为什么不早说?     - 因为主人没有问\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Why haven't you spoken of this before?     - Because master did not ask.
	他在动歪脑筋\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's up to something.
	你是说有另一条路到魔多?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
	对 有一条小路\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes. There's a path...
	和一些阶梯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...and some stairs.
	然后\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And then...
	有一条隧道\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...a tunnel.
	他都带我们到这儿了  山姆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's led us this far, Sam.
	佛罗多先生 不行\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mr. Frodo, no.
	他信守他的诺言\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's been true to his word.
	不要\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No.
	带路吧 史麦戈\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Lead the way, Smeagol.
	史麦戈总是很乐意帮忙\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Good Smeagol always helps.
	喂?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hello?
	树须?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Treebeard?
	他去哪了?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Where has he gone?
	昨天晚上我做了一个最美妙的梦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I had the loveliest dream last night.
	那有一个大桶  里面装满了烟叶\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
	我们痛痛快快的抽完这些烟叶  然后\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And we smoked all of it. And then...
	你不舒服了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...you were sick.
	只要能抽上一口老雪茄  要我干啥都行\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
	你听到这个了吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Did you hear that?
	又来了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There it is again.
	这里有什么不对劲  完全不对劲\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Something's not right here. Not right at all.
	你只是说有些东西像树\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You just said something... Treeish.
	不  我没有  我只是在伸展\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No, I didn't. I was just stretching.
	你比较高\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You're taller.
	- 谁?     - 你!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Who?      - You!
	- 比什么?     - 比我!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Than what?      - Than me!
	我一直比你高\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I've always been taller than you.
	皮聘  谁都知道我比较高  而你比较矮\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one. You're the short one.
	行了  梅里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Please, Merry.
	你多高? 三英尺六英寸? 最多?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?
	然而我有差不多三英尺七英寸\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
	三英尺八英寸!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	3'8"!
	三英尺八英寸\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Three-foot-eight.
	你做了些什么\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You did something.
	梅里  不要! 不要喝\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Merry, don't! Don't drink it!
	梅里!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Merry!
	不 树须说你不应该喝\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
	- 我想喝!     - 这可能很危险!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- I want some!     - It could well be dangerous!
	给我  梅里!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Give me it back. Merry!
	发生什么事了?!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What's happening?!
	它抓住我的腿了!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's got my leg!
	梅里!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Merry!
	救命!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Help!
	跟你一起走\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Away with you.
	你不应该醒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You should not be waking.
	吃土  挖深点  喝点水\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.
	去睡觉\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Go to sleep.
	跟你一起\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Away with you.
	快点  森林就要醒了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come, the forest is waking up.
	它很危险\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It isn't safe.
	这些树疯了  很危险\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
	愤怒吞噬了他们的心\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Anger festers in their hearts.
	他们的思想邪恶\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Black are their thoughts.
	仇恨强烈\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Strong is their hate.
	如果他们能伤害你们  他们就会这么干\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They will harm you if they can.
	我们现在人手太少\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There are too few of us now.
	人太少不能对付他们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
	为什么你们能活这么长而人却这么少?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
	- 树人有孩子吗?     -布-拉-鲁\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Are there Ent children?     - Bru-ra-hroom.
	已经很多很多年没有了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
	- 为什么这样?     - 我们失去了树人妻子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Why is that?     - We lost the Entwives.
	哦  真遗憾\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, I'm sorry.
	- 她们怎么死的?     - 死? 不\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- How did they die?     - Die? No.
	我们把她们弄丢了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We lost them.
	到现在还找不到她们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And now we cannot find them.
	我想你们在夏尔没有看到树人妻子吧?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
	应该没有\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Can't say that I have.
	你  皮聘?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You, Pip?
	她们看起来像什么?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What do they look like?
	现在我已经记不清了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't remember now.
	伊多拉斯以及梅杜西金殿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
	洛汗国国王希优顿的皇宫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan...
	他的身心受到蛊惑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...whose mind is overthrown.
	萨鲁曼控制了希优顿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Saruman 's hold over King Theoden Is now very strong.
	王上 您的儿子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My lord, your son...
	他死了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...he is dead.
	王上?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My lord?
	叔叔?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Uncle?
	您不去看他?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Will you not go to him?
	您什么也不做吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Will you do nothing?
	谨言慎行\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Be careful what you say.
	我们在这不受欢迎\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do not look for welcome here.
	他一定是昨晚去世的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
	国王失去独子和王储真不幸\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
	我理解  他的死一定让你很难过\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I understand. His passing is hard to accept.
	尤其是你的兄长也弃你不顾\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
	让我一个人静一静 毒蛇!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Leave me alone, snake!
	你的确是孤零零的一个人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, but you are alone.
	天晓得你在黑暗中受多少煎熬\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness...
	你在孤寂难熬的夜晚\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...in the bitter watches of the night...
	生命一点一滴地凋谢枯萎\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...when all your life seems to shrink.
	你受到四面高墙禁锢\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The walls of your bower closing in about you.
	如同笼中鸟一般渴望自由\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
	这么美丽\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So fair.
	却如此冷漠\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So cold.
	就像寒冬后的春泉依然冰冷\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
	你的话是毒药\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Your words are poison.
	连墓园都比这儿热闹\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
	你们不能带武器见希优顿王  灰袍甘道夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
	这是葛力马巧言之令\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	By order of Grima Wormtongue.
	你的手杖\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Your staff.
	你就让一个老人带着手杖吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
	王上 灰袍甘道夫来了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
	他是恶兆的信差\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's a herald of woe.
	你近来似乎不太欢迎来访者\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late...
	希优顿王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...Theoden King.
	他是不受欢迎的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's not welcome.
	我为什么要欢迎你?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Why should I welcome you...
	乌鸦嘴甘道夫?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...Gandalf Stormcrow?
	说的好 王上\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A just question, my liege.
	这名江湖术士这么晚才跑来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
	我替他取名为噩耗\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Lathspell I name him.
	噩耗就是不受欢迎的恶客\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Ill news is an ill guest.
	给我闭嘴  别在这儿搬弄是非\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
	我通过烈火和死亡的试炼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have not passed through fire and death...
	不是为了跟蠢材做口舌之争\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
	他的手杖\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	His staff.
	我叫你们没收巫师的手杖\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I told you to take the wizard's staff.
	希优顿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Theoden...
	塞哲尔之子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...son of Thengel...
	你活在阴影下太久了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...too long have you sat in the Shadows.
	你最好乖乖别动\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I would stay still if I were you.
	听我说\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hearken to me!
	我把你从咒语中释放出来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I release you from the spell.
	你在这里没有力量\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You have no power here...
	灰袍甘道夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...Gandalf the Grey.
	萨鲁曼 我要把你逼出来  就像把剧毒逼出伤口\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
	等等\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Wait.
	我一走 希优顿就会死\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If I go, Theoden dies.
	你杀不了我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You did not kill me...
	更杀不了他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...you will not kill him.
	洛汗国是我的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Rohan is mine.
	出来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Be gone.
	你很面熟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I know your face.
	伊欧玟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Eowyn.
	伊欧玟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Eowyn.
	甘道夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gandalf?
	你又重获自由了 我的朋友\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Breathe the free air again, my friend.
	我的梦里充满了黑暗\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Dark have been my dreams of late.
	你从前的力量会恢复的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Your fingers would remember their old strength better...
	只要你握住宝剑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...if they grasped your sword.
	我只想\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I've only...
	自始至终只想服侍您  王上\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...ever served you, my lord.
	你只想用邪术让我臣服于你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
	请放逐我吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Send me not from your sight.
	不 王上 饶了他吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No, my lord! No, my lord.
	让他走\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let him go.
	已经流了太多血了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
	给我滚开!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Get out of my way!
	希优顿王万岁!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hail, Theoden King!
	希优德呢?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Where is Theodred?
	我儿子呢?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Where is my son?
	永志花\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Simbelmyn?
	它一直生长在先王的坟上\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
	现在也将永远覆盖在吾儿之墓\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
	厄运应该降临在我身上\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Alas that these evil days should be mine.
	少年英年早逝 老人苟延残喘\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The young perish and the old linger.
	但我还是该活着\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That I should live...
	看着我的王国灭亡\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...to see the last days of my house.
	希优德的死不是你的错\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Theodred's death was not of your making.
	白发人不该送黑发人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No parent should have to bury their child.
	他生前很坚强\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He was strong in life.
	死后也将与你的先王同在\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
	他们措手不及\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They had no warning.
	手无寸铁\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They were unarmed.
	现在野人正穿越西谷  烧毁经过的一切\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
	干草  茅屋和树木\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Rick, cot and tree.
	妈妈呢?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Where is Mama?
	这只是萨鲁曼大军的一小部份\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
	他和索伦结盟后势力更强大\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
	你必须正面迎敌\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Ride out and meet him head on.
	引开他的大军 保护老弱妇孺\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Draw him away from your women and children.
	你一定要迎战\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You must fight.
	目前有两千名精兵向北而来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
	伊欧墨对你忠心耿耿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Eomer is loyal to you.
	他的部下会回来为他们的国王奋战\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	His men will return and fight for their king.
	他们离这儿有三百里路\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
	伊欧墨救不了我们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Eomer cannot help us.
	我知道你要我怎么做\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I know what it is you want of me...
	但是我不能让我的人民白白去送死\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...but I will not bring further death to my people.
	我不想冒险全面开战\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I will not risk open war.
	敌人已向你宣战  不管你想不想冒险\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
	就我所知\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	When last I looked...
	我希优顿才是洛汗国国王  不是亚拉冈\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
	国王的命令是什么\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Then what is the king's decision?
	国王下令\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	By order of the king...
	全城军民撤退\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...the city must empty.
	撤退到圣盔谷碉堡\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
	不要携带笨重的财宝只带必需品\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do not burden yourself with treasures. Take only what provisions you need.
	圣盔谷\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Helm's Deep.
	他应该一决死战 而不是逃之夭夭\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
	一国之君就应该捍卫人民\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Who will defend them if not their king?
	他这么做也是为了人民着想\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	...but for a small culvert at its base...
	只比排水管大一点\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	怎么做 火怎么烧得了石头?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
	还是有希望\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There is still hope.
	就算亚拉冈在战争中活下来你们还是会分开\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
	就算亚拉冈打败索伦成为国王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king...
	而你的愿望也都实现\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...and all that you hope for comes true...
	他还是逃不了死亡的命运\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	...an image of the splendor of the kings of Men...

	...you will linger on in darkness and in doubt...
	就像没有星光的冬夜\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
	你将满怀伤悲\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Here you will dwell...
	住在一天一天干枯的老树下\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...bound to your grief under the fading trees...
	直到世界改变\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	There is nothing for you here...

	敌人的力量越来越强大\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The power of the enemy is growing.
	索伦将利用他的傀儡萨鲁曼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman...
	消灭洛汗人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...to destroy the people of Rohan.
	艾辛格出动邪恶大军\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	In his heart, Frodo begins to understand...
	这场旅程将夺去他的生命\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	You have foreseen It.
	这是我们必须冒的险\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It Is the risk we all took.
	当邪恶力量聚集  魔戒的意志力就会加强\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
	它一心一意想回到人类手上\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It works hard now to find its way back Into the hands of Men.
	因为人类很容易受到它的诱惑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Men, who are so easily seduced by Its power.
	年轻的刚铎将军只要伸出手\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand...
	希望将魔戒占为己有  整个世界就会沦陷\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	It is close now.
	就快达成他的目标\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So close to achieving its goal.
	索伦即将奴役世上所有生物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	But now, something is about to happen...
	没发生过\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...that has not happened...
	有好长一段时间了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...for an age.
	树人会议\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Entmoot.
	那是什么?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What's that?
	那是一个集会\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	'Tis a gathering.
	什么样的集会?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A gathering of what?

	Beech. Oak.
	栗树 白杨树\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Chestnut. Ash.
	很好  很好  很好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Good. Good. Good.
	很多树人都来了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Many have come.
	我们要决定树人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Now we must decide if the Ents...
	该不该参战\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...will go to war.
	撤退 快进洞穴!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	They can support the archers from above the gate.
	亚拉冈  你需要休息\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Aragorn, you must rest.
	半死对我们没用\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	Aragorn!
	我会和女人们一起到洞里去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	That is an honorable charge.
	照顾孩子们  寻找食物  等待勇士们归来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
	那里的名声怎么样?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What renown is there in that?
	女王  这是英勇而不是为了名声\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
	谁负责最后防线?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
	- 让我站到你那边     - 不是我的力量可以决定的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Let me stand at your side.  - It is not in my power to command it.
	你不能命令其他人留下!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You do not command the others to stay!
	他们和你一起战斗因为他们不想和你分开\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	I'm sorry.
	农夫 老人 小孩\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
	这些人根本无法作战\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	These are no soldiers.
	- 他们多半见不到冬天了     - 人太少了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Most have seen too many winters.     - Or too few.
	看看他们  他们的恐惧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Look at them. They're frightened.
	从他们眼中你可以看出来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I can see it in their eyes.
	那我也该跟着他们一起牺牲\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Then I shall die as one of them!
	让他去吧  伙计\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	Where is the horse and the rider?
	胜利的号角在哪里?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Where is the horn that was blowing?
	它们早就消失了  就像落在高山的雨滴\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They have passed like rain on the mountains.
	或是拂过草原的微风\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Like wind in the meadow.
	昔日的荣耀就像太阳西下\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The days have gone down in the West...
	黯然消失在山后\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...behind the hills...
	被黑暗笼罩\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...into Shadow.
	怎么会变成这样?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	How did it come to this?
	已经很长时间了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's been going for hours.
	他们肯定已经做出决定了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They must have decided something by now.
	决定? 没有\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Decided? No.
	我们刚道完\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We only just finished saying...
	早安\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...good morning.
	但现在是半夜啊\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But it's nighttime already.
	你们不能没完没了啊\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You can't take forever.
	别着急\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Don't be hasty.
	我们没时间了!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We're running out of time!
	快 快到外墙\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Move! Move to the outer wall.
	把剑给我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Give me your sword.
	你叫什么?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What is your name?
	哈拉斯  哈玛之子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
	大家都说我们活不过今晚\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The men are saying we will not live out the night.
	他们说没有希望了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They say that it is hopeless.
	这是把好剑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This is a good sword.

	Haleth, son of Hama...
	永远都有希望\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	We have trusted you this far. You have not led us astray.
	原谅我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Forgive me.
	我不该绝望\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I was wrong to despair.
	还来的及改改这身锁子甲\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
	胸口这儿有点紧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's a little tight across the chest.
	那不是半兽人号角\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That is no Orc horn.
	快去叫国王\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Send for the king.
	- 打开大门!     - 打开大门!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	这怎么可能?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	How is this possible?
	我带来爱隆王的信息\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
	精灵曾和人类结为同盟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
	在很久以前并肩作战\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	We come to honor that allegiance.
	太欢迎了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You are most welcome.
	我们很荣幸再跟人类并肩作战\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
	你挑的什么烂位置\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You could have picked a better spot.
	希望你的好运气能撑过今晚\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
	你的朋友都来了 亚拉冈\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
	希望他们熬得过今晚\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let's hope they last the night.
	- 发生什么事?     - 你要我说给你听?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- What's happening out there?   - Shall I describe it to you?
	还是替你找垫脚箱?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Or would you like me to find you a box?
	开战了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So it begins.
	有没有射中?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Did they hit anything?
	齐射\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Give them a volley.
	- 放箭!     - 放箭!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
	19!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Nineteen!
	梅里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Merry.
	我们同意了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We have just agreed.
	同意什么?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes?
	我在树人会议上提到你们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have told your names to the Entmoot...
	我们都同意\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...and we have agreed...
	你们不是半兽人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...you are not Orcs.
	那真是好消息\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Well, that's good news.
	那萨鲁曼呢? 你们有什么关于他的决定?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And what about Saruman? Have you come to a decision about him?
	别急 梅里雅达克\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
	别急?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hasty?
	我们的朋友在打仗\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Our friends are out there.
	他们需要我们的帮忙  他们不能孤军奋战\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They need our help. They cannot fight this war on their own.
	战争? 没错\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	War? Yes.
	战争影响了大家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It affects us all.
	树身 树根和树枝\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Tree, root and twig.
	不过你要了解 小哈比人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But you must understand, young Hobbit...
	用古树人语说话要花很久时间\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish...
	如非必要我们是不会开口的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...and we never say anything unless it is worth taking.
	17!18!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	Is this it?
	你就只有这点能耐吗 萨鲁曼?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	抵住门!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Brace the gate!

	Gimli!
	树人无法力挽狂澜\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
	我们只能像以前一样逆来顺受\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We must weather such things as we have always done.
	你们怎么能这么决定?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	How can that be your decision?!
	这不是我们的战争\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This is not our war.
	可是你们也属于这世界!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But you're part of this world!
	不是吗?!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Aren't you?!

	You must help. Please.
	你们一定要想想办法\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You must do something.
	你很年轻也很勇敢  梅里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You are young and brave, Master Merry.
	但是你的旅程已经结束了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But your part in this tale is over.
	回家吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Go back to your home.
	也许树须说的对\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Maybe Treebeard right.
	我们也无能为力 梅里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We don't belong here, Merry.
	我们太渺小了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's too big for us.
	我们能做什么呢?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What can we do in the end?
	我们还有夏尔\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We've got the Shire.
	也许我们应该回家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Maybe we should go home.
	艾辛格的战火会蔓延\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The fires of Isengard will spread...
	塔克镇和雄鹿地树林也会燃烧精光\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
	还有\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And...
	世上一切绿色的  美好的东西都会毁灭\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
	夏尔也会毁于一旦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

	你们能撑多久就多久\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	太远了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's a long way.
	把我丢过去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Toss me.
	- 什么?     - 我跳不了那么远!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- What?      - I cannot jump the distance!
	把我丢过去!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You'll have to toss me!
	别跟精灵小子说\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Don't tell the Elf.
	我会守口如瓶\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not a word.
	撑住大门!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Shore up the door!

	Fall back!
	撤退!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Fall back!
	他们攻进来了!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They have broken through!
	城堡给攻破了  撤退!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The castle is breached. Retreat!
	- 撤退!     - 撤退!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Fall back!     - Retreat!
	快把他们带进去!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!
	进去碉堡!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Into the Keep!
	我把你们带到森林西边\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
	你们往北走就可以回到家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
	等等 停下来!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Wait! Stop!
	停下来!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Stop!
	转回去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Turn around.
	- 转回去 带我们到南边去     - 南边?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Turn around. Take us south.     - South?
	那不就是去艾辛格的路\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But that will lead you past Isengard.
	一点也没错\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes. Exactly.
	走南边  我们可以悄悄越过萨鲁曼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
	越危险的地方  越是安全\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
	他一定料想不到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's the last thing he'll expect.
	我不太明白\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That doesn't make sense to me.
	不过你们个子很小\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But then you are very small.
	也许你们是对的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Perhaps you're right.
	就南边吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	South it is, then.
	抓紧了 小哈比人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hold on, little Shirelings.
	我一向都喜欢往南走\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I always like going south.
	就好像下坡一样\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Somehow it feels like going downhill.
	你疯啦? 我们会被逮到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Are you mad? We'll be caught.
	才不会\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No, we won't.
	这次不会\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not this time.
	你看!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Look!
	奥斯吉力亚斯在燃烧!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Osgiliath burns!
	魔多大军攻来了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mordor has come.
	魔戒也救不了刚铎\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Ring will not save Gondor.

	Don't you know your Sam?
	我办不到 山姆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I can't do this, Sam.
	我知道\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I know.
	这不公平\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's all wrong.
	我们根本就不该来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
	但是我们来了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But we are.
	这就像我们听过的精彩故事 佛罗多先生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
	描述伟大的事迹\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The ones that really mattered.
	有时候你不想知道结局\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	因为怎么可能有快乐结局?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...because how could the end be happy?
	这世界怎么可能回到从前?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	How could the world go back to the way It was...

	胜利!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Victory!
	我们胜利了!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We have victory!
	但是最后  阴影终究会过去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But In the end, It's only a passing thing this shadow.
	就连黑暗也会消失\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Even darkness must pass.
	崭新的一天将会来临\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A new day will come.
	太阳也会散发更明亮的光芒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And when the sun shines, It will shine out the clearer.
	这才是让人永生难忘有意义的感人故事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
	就算你太年轻不明白为什么\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Even If you were too small to understand why.
	但是我想我明白了 佛罗多先生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
	我现在明白了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I know now.
	故事的主角\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Folk in those stories...
	有很多机会放弃 但是他们并没有\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
	他们决定勇往直前\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They kept going...
	因为他们抱着一种信念\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...because they were holding on to something.
	我们抱着什么信念 山姆?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What are we holding on to, Sam?
	这世上一定存在着善良 佛罗多先生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
	值得我们奋战到底\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And it's worth fighting for.
	我想我们终于互相理解了 佛罗多巴金斯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
	你很清楚我国的法律  你父王的命令\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
	你放他们走就会被处死\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
	那我宁愿死\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Then it is forfeit.
	放了他们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Release them.

	Final count...
	- 42     - 42?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Forty-two     - Forty-two?
	对于一个尖耳朵的精灵王子来说  算不错了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
	我正坐在第43个身上\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
	- 43     - 它已经死了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- Forty-three.     - He was already dead.
	- 它还在抽搐     - 它在抽搐\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- He was twitching.     - He was twitching...
	是因为我的斧子正砍在它神经系统上!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
	-他好像不开心  是吗?     - 一点都不开心   梅里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- He doesn't look too happy, does he?   - Not too happy at all, Merry.
	我想  上面的景色一定不错\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
	哦  是的  看来它还挺牢固啊\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.
	我听说材料非常好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	- 世界又恢复平常了     - 不  还没有\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	- The world back to normal, that's all.     - No, it isn't.

	I'm starving.
	看看能不能有运气在附近找到点像样的吃的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
	也许只有死老鼠和发霉的面包\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

	It can't be.
	- 是的!     - 长端叶\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
	太好了  每人一桶\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's perfect. One barrel each.
	等等\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Wait.
	我们该分给树须吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
	分?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Share it?
	不  不\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No. No.
	这是死掉的植物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Dead plant and all that.
	他不会理解的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Don't think he'd understand.
	也许还是远亲呢\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Could be a distant relative.
	我懂了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I get it.
	别着急\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Don't be hasty.
	正是\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	This is the old sewer.
	一直通到城市边缘\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.

	The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee...
	那里园丁一定很受尊重\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	到了树林  你们会走那条路?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What road will you take once you reach the woods?
	咕鲁说有条路\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	主人说要到魔多\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...
	他们在荒野游荡\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	...somewhere in the wilderness.
	也许我们会被编入故事或诗歌\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
	什么?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What?
	也许以后会有人说咱们听听佛罗多和魔戒的故事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
	另一个人就说 是啊 那是我最爱听的故事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And they'll say, "Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."
	佛罗多好勇敢 对吧 爸爸?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	是啊 孩子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	"Yes, my boy.
	他是最有名的哈比人  了不起\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The most famousest of Hobbits. And that's saying a lot."
	忘了一个重要人物\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
	山姆卫斯勇士\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	"Samwise the Brave."
	我想多听听山姆的事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I want to hear more about Sam.

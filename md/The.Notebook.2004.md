	艾莉  我一直在考虑我们不该结婚的理由\N
	Allie, I've been thinking a lot about why we shouldn't get married.
	好吧  我们为什么不该结婚\N
	Okay, I give up, why shouldn't we get married?
	问题就在这儿  我起初想不到\N
	That's the thing, I couldn't think of anything at first.
	然后突然就想起来了  你父母\N
	And then, it just dawned on me. Your parents.
	-我父母  -没错\N
	- My parents? - Absolutely.
	你父母  多谢了啊\N
	Your old mom and dad. Thank you for that.
	-老妈啊  -问题是  他们很喜欢我\N
	- Mom? - You see, the problem is that they love me.
	-我正是他们心中的...  -是吗\N
	- I'm exactly the type of man... - They do?

	See, Allie, I think... Damn it, I think you have to marry me.
	-我觉得你一定得嫁给我  -是吗\N
	- I think you need to marry me. - I do?
	-是的  -为什么\N
	- Yes, you do. - I do, why?
	因为  如果你嫁给我  你父母就会知道\N
	Because if you do, your parents will always know...
	你因为没能让他们失望\N
	...the unhappiness that you feel
	而有多么的郁闷\N
	for not being able to disappoint them.
	我觉得你可能忘记了一个小小的细节\N
	I think you may have overlooked one minor detail.
	什么啊\N
	And what's that?
	你得先得到他们的允许\N
	Well, you see, you have to get their permission first.

	And I think you may have overestimated their affection for you.
	是吗\N
	Is that right?
	我觉得不会\N
	Oh, I don't think so.
	-为什么  -因为我已经问过了\N
	- And why not? - Oh, because I asked them already...
	他们同意了\N

	为什么她说"好"的那一刻\N
	...why at the very moment she said yes...
	脑中却浮现出诺亚的脸\N
	...Noah's face came to her mind.
	诺亚\N
	Hey, Noah, yeah!

	-温莎种植园  -爸爸\N
	- The Windsor Plantation. - Dad...
	别来这套  什么都别说\N
	Don't "dad" me, I don't wanna hear about it.
	我已经跟银行商量过了  他们会给你贷款\N
	I already talked to the bank, they're gonna give you the loan.
	-我不能让你卖房子啊  -已经卖了\N
	- Well, I can't let you sell your house. - It's done.
	这是好事  去做吧\N
	It's a good thing. You should do it.
	等等  你卖了房子  你去哪住啊\N
	Wait a second. You sell the house, where are you gonna live?
	跟你住啊  傻子  你以为呢\N
	With you, dummy, what do you think?
	总得有人帮你修葺啊\N
	Somebody's gotta help you fix it up.
	诺亚看了一眼那栋房子\N
	Noah took a look at the house...
	却只看到了\N
	...but only saw one thing:
	艾莉\N
	Allie.
	于是他决定实现自己人生的梦想\N
	He decided right there to fulfill his lifelong dream.
	他要从零开始重建老房子\N

	那天见到艾莉后\N
	After seeing Allie that day...
	诺亚内心有什么破碎了\N
	...something inside Noah snapped.
	他脑子里钻进了一个念头\N
	He got the notion into his head...
	如果他能修好他们那晚上去的老房子\N
	that if he restored the old house where they had come that night
	艾莉就终会回到他身边\N
	...Allie would find a way to come back to him.
	有人称之为心甘情愿\N
	Some called it a labor of love.
	也有人会有别的看法\N
	Others called it something else.
	但实际上  诺亚是有点疯了\N
	But in fact, Noah had gone a little mad.
	-打扰  -那么...\N

	有不少感兴趣的买家\N
	He had a number of interested buyers...
	但他总能找到不卖的理由\N
	...but he always found a reason not to sell it to them.
	不行\N
	No.
	不是出价太低\N
	Either their bids were too low...
	如果买家同意了他的要价\N
	...or if they met his asking price,
	他又会觉得还不够\N
	he felt it was worth a lot more.
	价格真高  但我要了\N
	It's a lot of money, but I'll take it.
	五万\N
	Fifty thousand dollars.
	-比我的要价还高  -没错\N
	- That's more than my asking price. - That's right.
	可是个占便宜的买卖\N
	It's a great deal more.
	他跟出价超过他要价五千美元的人说\N
	He told the man that offered him $5000 over his price...
	精神正常的人是绝不会那么做的\N
	...that no one in his right mind would do that...
	而他绝不会允许一个疯子住在这栋房子里\N
	...and he wouldn't have a lunatic living in his house.

	What do you want, Noah?
	什么意思\N
	What do you mean, what do I want?
	从我这儿\N
	From me.
	有时候你跟我说话  却根本没在看我\N
	Sometimes when you talk to me, you don't even see me.

	Finally.
	你要怎么办  艾莉\N
	What are you gonna do, Al?
	我不知道\N
	I don't know.
	又回到这样了\N
	We're back to that?
	我们又回去了吗\N
	Are we back there?
	过去几天怎么说  那都是已经发生了的\N
	What about the past couple of days? They happened, you know.
	这我知道  而且这几天很美好\N
	I know that they happened, and they were wonderful.
	但也很不负责任\N
	But they were also very irresponsible.
	我的未婚夫正在旅馆等着我  等他得知一切\N
	I have a fiance waiting for me at a hotel who's gonna be crushed...
	-会伤心欲绝  -你跟我做爱\N
	- ...when he finds out... - So you make love to me...
	然后又回到你丈夫身边吗\N
	...and then you go back to your husband?
	你就这么打算的吗\N
	Was that your plan?
	是我没通过什么测试吗\N
	Was that a test that I didn't pass?
	不  我给了他承诺\N
	No. I made a promise to a man.
	他给了我一枚戒指  而我承诺了他\N
	He gave me a ring, I gave him my word.
	你的承诺现在不已经\N
	Your word is shot to hell now...
	-打破了吗  -我不知道  我不知道\N
	- ...don't you think? - I don't know. I don't know.
	我跟他谈过之后就会知道了\N
	I'll find out when I talk to him.
	这不是在于你是不是遵守承诺\N
	This is not about keeping your promise.
	也不是在于顺从你的心\N
	And it's not about following your heart.
	-是为了安全感  -什么意思\N
	- It's about security. - What is that supposed to mean?
	-钱  -你说什么...\N
	- Money! - What are you ta...?
	-他很有钱  -我恨你  你个自大的混蛋\N
	- He's got a lot of money. - Now I hate you, you smug bastard.
	我也恨你  如果你走  我就恨你\N
	Well, I hate you. If you leave here, I hate you.
	你真的注意到发生了什么事了吗\N
	Have you been paying attention to anything that's happening?
	看来没有  我一定是误解了一切信号\N
	I guess not, I think I must have misread all of those signals.
	我看也是\N
	I guess you did.
	你觉得无聊  你自己也清楚\N
	You're bored. You're bored and you know it.
	如果你不是觉得少了什么也不会来了\N
	You wouldn't be here if there wasn't something missing.
	你个自大的混蛋\N
	You arrogant son of a bitch!
	你能留下吗\N
	Would you just stay with me?
	留下  为什么\N
	Stay with you? What for?
	-看看我们  已经在吵架了  -我们就这样\N
	- Look at us, we're already fighting. - Well, that's what we do.
	我们吵架\N
	We fight.
	你说我自大  混蛋\N
	You tell me when I'm being an arrogant son of a bitch...
	我说你好烦人\N
	...and I tell you when you're being a pain in the ass.
	你绝大部分时候的确很烦人\N
	Which you are, 99 percent of the time.
	我不担心会伤到你的感情\N
	I'm not afraid to hurt your feelings.
	反正2秒钟就会恢复过来\N
	They have like a two-second rebound rate...
	你又继续干烦人的事了\N
	...and you're back doing the next pain-in-the-ass thing.
	-所以呢  -所以  不会很轻松的\N
	- So, what? - So it's not gonna be easy.
	会很艰难\N
	It's gonna be really hard.
	我们每天都得解决这些问题\N
	We're gonna have to work at this every day...
	但我想这么做  因为我想要你\N
	...but I want to do that, because I want you.
	我要全部的你  直到永远\N
	I want all of you, forever.
	你和我  每一天\N
	You and me, every day.
	你能帮我个忙吗\N
	Will you do something for me?
	你能想象一下你的生活吗\N
	Please? Will you just picture your life for me?
	30  40年之后的样子\N
	Thirty years from now, 40 years from now, what's it look like?
	如果是跟他在一起  去吧\N
	If it's with that guy, go!
	走吧\N
	Go!
	我失去过你一次  我还能再做一次\N
	I lost you once, I think I could do it again...
	如果那真的是你想要的\N
	...if I thought it's what you really wanted.
	但你不许回避问题  选择轻松的路\N
	But don't you take the easy way out.
	轻松  哪里轻松了\N
	What easy way? There is no easy way.
	不管我怎么做  总会有人受伤\N
	No matter what I do, somebody gets hurt.
	你能不能别去考虑别人想怎么样\N
	Would you stop thinking about what everyone wants?
	别去考虑我想要什么\N
	Stop thinking about what I want.
	他想要什么  你父母想要什么\N
	What he wants, what your parents want.
	你想要什么\N
	What do you want?
	-你想要什么  -没那么简单\N
	- What do you want? - It's not that simple.
	-你想要什么  -没那么...\N
	- What do you want? - It's not...
	该死的  你想要什么\N
	Goddamn it, what do you want?
	我得走了\N
	I have to go.
	最亲爱的艾莉\N
	My dearest Allie.
	我昨晚无法入睡\N
	I couldn't sleep last night
	因为我知道我们之间已经结束\N
	because I know that it's over between us.
	我不再心怀怨念  因为我知道我们的爱是真的\N
	I'm not bitter anymore, because I know that what we had was real.
	如果在遥远的未来\N
	And if in some distant place in the future
	我们看到了过着新人生的彼此\N
	we see each other in our new lives...
	我会对你露出开心的笑容\N
	...I'll smile at you with joy...
	记起那个树荫下与你共度的夏天\N
	...and remember how we spent a summer beneath the trees...
	通过彼此领悟人生  在爱情中成长\N
	...learning from each other and growing in love.
	
	溪镇旅馆
	最美好的爱情  能唤醒人的灵魂\N
	The best love is the kind that awakens the soul...
	让我们去寻求更多\N
	...and makes us reach for more.
	在我们心中种下火种\N
	That plants a fire in our hearts...
	给心灵带来安宁\N
	...and brings peace to our minds.
	这就是你所给我的\N
	And that's what you've given me.
	希望你也永远能获得这些\N
	That's what I'd hoped to give to you forever.
	我爱你  我们来日再见了  诺亚\N
	I love you. I'll be seeing you. Noah.
	真美  好美的故事\N
	It's beautiful. It's a beautiful story.
	是啊\N
	Yes, it is.
	不知道  但这故事让我好伤感\N
	I don't know why, but it makes me feel sad.
	我知道你现在觉得茫然若失\N
	I know you feel lost right now...
	但别担心\N
	...but don't worry.
	没有什么会被真正遗忘\N
	Nothing is ever lost, or can be lost

	Two, I can kick the crap out of him.
	三  我离开你\N

	因为\N

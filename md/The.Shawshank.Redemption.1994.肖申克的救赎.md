	杜弗伦先生  请你描述...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mr. Dufresne, describe...
	命案当晚和妻子争吵的情形\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered.
	我们吵的很凶\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It was very bitter.
	她说不怕我知道  她讨厌偷偷摸摸\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	She said she was glad I knew,that she hated all the sneaking around.
	她还说  想去雷诺市办离婚\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And she said that she wanted a divorce in Reno.
	-你怎样回答?  -我拒绝离婚\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-What was your response?  -I told her I would not grant one.
	"你别想活着去雷诺市"\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."
	邻居作证你说过这句话\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Those were your words, according to your neighbors.
	也许吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If they say so.
	我气炸了  记不清楚\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I really don't remember. I was upset.
	你们吵完以后呢?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What happened after you argued with your wife?
	她收拾行李\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	She packed a bag.
	去跟昆丁先生住一起\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	She packed a bag to go and stay with Mr. Quentin.
	葛兰昆丁  乡村俱乐部的高球教练\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Glenn Quentin, golf pro at the Snowden Hills Country Club...
	你最近才发现  他是你太太的情夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	whom you had discovered was your wife's lover.
	你跟踪她吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Did you follow her?
	我先去酒吧买醉\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I went to a few bars first.
	然后去他家  但没人在\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Later, I drove to his house to confront them. They weren't home.
	我停了车\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I parked in the turnout...
	等他们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and waited.
	用意何在?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	With what intention?
	我不确定\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm not sure.
	我醉了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I was confused...
	糊里糊涂\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	drunk.
	我想...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I think...
	最多只是吓吓他们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	mostly I wanted to scare them.
	结果他们一回来  你就冲进屋杀了他们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them.
	不  我逐渐酒醒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I was sobering up.
	开车回家睡觉\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I got back in the car and I drove home to sleep it off.
	路中把枪丢入皇家河\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Along the way, I threw my gun into the Royal River.
	我已讲的很清楚\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I've been very clear on this point.
	但清洁妇隔天早晨上工时\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I get hazy where the cleaning woman shows up the following morning...
	发现床上的双尸\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and finds your wife in bed with her lover...
	身上满是点三八的弹孔\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	riddled with.38-caliber bullets.
	你不觉得这很巧吗?  还是只有我这么想?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?
	是很巧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes, it does.
	但你仍声称早在案发之前\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yet you still maintain you threw your gun into the river...
	就已丢弃了枪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	before the murders took place.
	这种说法倒是很省事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's very convenient.
	这是实话\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's the truth.
	警方打捞三天都没找到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The police dragged that river for three days, and nary a gun was found...
	这样就无法比对\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	so no comparison could be made
	你的手枪和\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	between your gun and the bullets...
	受害者尸体上的弹痕\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims.
	所以呢\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And that also...
	这样也非常省事  不是吗  杜弗伦先生?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	is very convenient. Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?
	我是清白的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Since I am innocent of this crime...
	所以找不到枪反倒对我非常不利\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I find it decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found.
	一切证据都向各位报告了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence.
	脚印和胎痕证明被告在场\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have footprints.
	散落地面的子弹上有他的指纹\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bullets on the ground bearing his fingerprints.
	酒瓶碎片上同样也有指痕\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints.
	最重要的是...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And most of all...
	一位美女与情夫...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	we have a beautiful young woman and her lover...
	相拥而死\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	lying dead in each other's arms.
	他们是有伤风化\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They had sinned.
	但是...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But was their crime so great...
	罪该致死吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	as to merit a death sentence?
	请各位与此同时...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	While you think about that...
	再考虑一件事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	think about this:
	一只左轮手枪只能装六发子弹  而非八发\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.
	所以他并非一时冲动\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}{\b1}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\3c&H2F2F2F&}{\4c&H000000&}I submit that this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion.\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	改编自斯蒂芬·金的短篇小说《丽塔海华丝及萧山克监狱的救赎》
	冲动并不可宽恕  但可理解\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That at least could be understood, if not condoned.
	然而...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No.
	这是复仇\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This was revenge...
	残忍而冷血的谋杀  想想看\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	of a much more brutal, cold-blooded nature. Consider this:
	这两人各中四枪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Four bullets per victim.
	共八枪  而非六枪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not six shots fired, but eight.
	因此他是先射完一轮\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That means that he fired the gun empty...
	再装弹补上两枪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and then stopped to reload...
	然后再一人添一枪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	so that he could shoot each of them again. An extra bullet per lover...
	射穿脑袋\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	right in the head.
	你面目冷漠  全无悔意  杜弗伦先生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.
	看见你就令我齿冷\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It chills my blood just to look at you.
	根据缅因州赋予我的权力...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	By the power vested in me by the state of Maine...
	我判处你两次终身监禁 按序执行\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I hereby order you to serve two life sentences back-to-back...
	每名受害者一次  退庭!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	one for each of your victims. So be it!
	坐下\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sit.
	根据你的材料 你的终身监禁已经服满20年\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We see you've served 20 years of a life sentence?
	-是的  -你改过自新了吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Yes, sir.  -You feel you've been rehabilitated?
	是的  改造好了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.
	我已得到深刻教训\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I mean, I learned my lesson.
	真的  我已洗心革面\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I can honestly say that I'm a changed man.
	我不会再做危害社会的事了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm no longer a danger to society.
	我向上帝发誓\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's God's honest truth.
	瑞德\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hey, Red.
	怎样?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	How'd it go?
	还不是老样子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Same old shit, different day.
	我了解\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yeah, I know how you feel.
	我下周也准备要吃闭门羹\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm up for rejection next week.
	我上周才假释被拒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yeah, I got rejected last week.
	很正常\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It happens.
	嗨，瑞德，借一包烟吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hey, Red, bump me a deck.
	滚开  你欠我五包\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Get out of my face, man! You're into me for five packs already.
	-四包  -五包\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Four!  -Five!
	美国每个监狱里可能都会有我这样的人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There must be a con like me in every prison in America.
	我能为你弄到各种东西\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm the guy who can get it for you.
	香烟啦  大麻啦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Cigarettes, a bag of reefer, if that's your thing...
	家有喜事想喝白兰地也行\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation.
	几乎是任何合理的东西\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Damn near anything within reason.
	是的 先生  我就像百货公司\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes, sir! I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.
	所以1949年  安迪·杜弗伦...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949...
	让我替他弄张丽塔·海华丝的电影海报\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...
	我立刻回答 没问题!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I told him, "No problem."
	大家到大门口集合\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	to the main gate
	到大门口集合\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	to the main gate
	安迪在47年初入肖申克监狱\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Andy came to Shawshank Prison...
	因为杀害老婆和情夫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	in early 1947 for murdering his wife and the fella she was banging.
	他本来是缅因州一家大银行的副总裁\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	On the outside, he'd been vice president of a large Portland bank.
	年轻有为 前程远大\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Good work for a man so young.
	瑞德\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Here Red
	听得懂英语吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You speak English, butt-steak?
	跟这位长官走\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You follow this officer.
	我这辈子没看过这么多满脸晦气的窝囊废\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I never seen such a sorry-Iooking heap of maggot shit in all my life.
	菜鸟  过来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hey, fish! Come over here!
	 瑞德?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Taking bets today, Red?
	赌烟或钱?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.
	烟  我赌两根\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Smokes. Put me down for two.
	你挑哪个?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	All right, who's your horse?
	那个小个子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That little sack of shit.
	-前头数来第八个他是第一个  -算你瞎眼 我赌了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Eighth. He'll be first.  -Bullshit! I'll take that action.
	你输定了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You're out some smokes, son.
	你聪明  你挑呀\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If you're so smart, you call it.
	胖脸肥臀那个\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'll take that chubby fat-ass there.
	第五个  我赌五根烟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The fifth one. Put me down for a quarter deck.
	菜鸟来了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Fresh fish today!
	菜鸟来啦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We're reeling them in!
	说实话  当初我并不看好他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him.
	弱不禁风的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.
	这是他给我的最初印象\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That was my first impression of the man.
	你挑谁?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What do you say?
	面带富贵相的高个儿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass.
	他?不可能啦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That guy? Never happen.
	-我赌十根烟  -有种\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-10 cigarettes.  -That's a rich bet.
	谁要和我赌?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Who's going to prove me wrong?
	赫伍?  渣哥?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Heywood? Jigger?
	史基?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Skeets?
	福洛?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Floyd!
	你们输定了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Four brave souls.
	回牢房准备点名\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Return to your cellblocks for evening count.
	全部回房去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	All prisoners, return to your cellblocks.
	向右转\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Turn to the right!
	看前方\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Eyes front.
	他是警备队长海利\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This is Mr. Hadley. He's captain of the guards.
	我是典狱长诺顿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.
	你们被判有罪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You are convicted felons.
	所以被送到这来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's why they've sent you to me.
	第一条规定:\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Rule number one:
	不许亵渎上帝\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No blasphemy.
	这不许有任何亵渎上帝的行为\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain in my prison.
	其它规矩...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The other rules...
	你们以后就知道了  有问题吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	you'll figure out as you go along. Any questions?
	什么时候吃饭?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	When do we eat?
	我们叫你吃就吃\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You eat when we say you eat.
	叫你拉就拉  叫你撒就撒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You shit when we say you shit, and piss when we say you piss.
	听明白了吗？你这蠢货\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?
	站起来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	On your feet.
	我只相信两件事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I believe in two things:
	纪律和圣经\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Discipline and the Bible.
	你们两样都少不了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Here, you'll receive both.
	把信仰寄托神\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Put your trust in the Lord.
	把贱命交给我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Your ass belongs to me.
	肖申克监狱欢迎各位\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Welcome to Shawshank.
	解铐\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Unhook them.
	转身\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Turn around.
	可以了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's enough.
	走到底\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Move to the end of the cage.
	转身  洒除虱粉\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Turn around. Delouse him.
	转身\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Turn around.
	到左边领囚衣和圣经\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Move out of the cage. Pick up your clothes and Bible.
	下一个\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Next man up!
	向右\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	To the right.
	右转  右转\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Right. Right.
	向左\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Left.
	头一夜最难熬  绝对如此\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The first night's the toughest. No doubt about it.
	光着屁股行进\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They march you in naked as the day you were born...
	火辣的药粉令你半盲\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	skin burning and half-blind from that delousing shit.
	当你进笼...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And when they put you in that cell...
	门闸锁上...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and those bars slam home...
	你才明白这是玩真的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	that's when you know it's for real.
	眨眼间  一生就毁了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.
	只留下无穷的悔恨\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.
	新囚在初夜多半濒临疯狂\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Most new fish come close to madness the first night.
	总会有人哭出来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Somebody always breaks down crying.
	毫无例外\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Happens every time.
	我们只是...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The only question is...
	等着看是谁\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	who's it going to be?
	用这聚赌也挺有趣的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.
	我赌安迪·杜弗伦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I had my money on Andy Dufresne.
	熄灯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Lights out!
	我还记得我在这的第一夜\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I remember my first night.
	虽然那已经是很久很久以前的事了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Seems like a long time ago.
	菜鸟  来嘛\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hey, fish.
	菜鸟  菜鸟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Fish, fish.
	怎么  怕黑吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What are you, scared of the dark?
	后悔爸妈搞出你来?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bet you wish your daddy never dicked your mama!
	小猪猪  你的肉好香\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Piggy! Pork! I want me a pork chop.
	老鸟总是捉弄菜鸟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The boys always go fishing with first-timers.
	直到惹哭才罢休\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And they don't quit till they reel someone in.
	猪公\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hey, Fat Ass.
	肥臀\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Fat Ass!
	说句话嘛\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Talk to me, boy.
	我听得到你呼吸\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.
	你别受这些白痴的骗\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Don't you listen to these nitwits, you hear me?
	这儿没那么糟啦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This place ain't so bad.
	跟你讲...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Tell you what...
	我帮你引见  带你进入状况\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'll introduce you around, make you feel right at home.
	有些同志...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I know a couple of big old bull queers that'd just...

	You'll tell him with my baton up your ass!
	放我出去呀\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let me out!
	你发什么神经病，你这混蛋肥猪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What is your malfunction, you fat barrel of monkey spunk?
	求求你  别关我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Please! I ain't supposed to be here.

	我不想数到三  连一我都不数\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	You don't understand.  I'm not supposed to be here.
	开门\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Open that cell.
	我也不想蹲你这破牢\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Me neither! They run this place like a fucking prison!

	Captain, take it easy!
	今天晚上如果再有人敢哀哀叫...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here tonight...
	我就扁得你们全部躺进医务室\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I swear by God and Jesus, you will all visit the infirmary.
	我说的是每一个人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Every last motherfucker in here.
	把这废人抬去医务室\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Call the trustees. Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.
	安迪头一夜就害我输两包烟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	His first night in the joint, Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.
	他一声都没吭\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He never made a sound.

	出发\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Roll out!
	你要吃吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Are you going to eat that?
	无此打算\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I hadn't planned on it.
	给我好吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Do you mind?
	又肥又嫩\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's nice and ripe.
	杰克 说谢谢你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Jake says thank you.
	他从巢中掉到地上\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.
	我要养到他会飞\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm going to look after him until he's big enough to fly.
	讨厌  赫伍来了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, no! Here he comes.
	早安  伙计们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Morning, fellas.
	真是个美好早晨啊\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Fine morning, isn't it?
	你知道为何如此美好吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?
	烟拿出来  就地排好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Send them down. I want them lined up...
	像合唱队一样排整齐\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	just like a pretty little chorus line.
	看呀  真壮观\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Look at that.
	-真受不了他  -我的乖乖\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-I can't stand this guy.  -Oh, Lord!
	爽  正牌 烤烟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes! Richmond, Virginia.
	闻我的屁吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Smell my ass!
	闻完再闻我的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	After he smells mine.
	瑞德  可惜你大大看走眼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's a shame about your horse coming in last and all.
	不过我真感谢我的猪公\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But I sure do love that winning horse of mine, though.
	出院后我得亲亲他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I owe that boy a big kiss when I see him.
	请他抽烟才对  小人得志\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!
	泰瑞\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hey, Tyrell.
	这周你在医务室值班吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You pull infirmary duty this week?
	那肥仔怎样了?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	How's my horse doing anyway?
	挂了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Dead.
	海利打烂他的头\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hadley busted his head up pretty good.
	医生已回家睡觉了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Doc had gone home for the night.
	他一直僵到天亮\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Poor bastard lay there till this morning.
	根本无药可救\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	By then, there wasn't nothing we could do.
	他叫什么名字?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What was his name?
	你说什么?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What'd you say?
	我想知道他的名字\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.
	关你屁事  菜鸟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What the fuck do you care, new fish?
	死人还要什么名字\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Doesn't fucking matter what his name was. He's dead.
	嘿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hey
	有人上过你了吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Anybody come at you yet?
	你名草有主了吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Anybody get to you yet?
	牢里人人需要朋友\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hey, we all need friends in here.
	我可以当你朋友\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I could be a friend to you.
	不易上手\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hard to get.
	我喜欢\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I like that.
	起初安迪不与人来往\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.
	大概心事重重\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I guess he had a lot on his mind...
	努力适应牢狱生活\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	trying to adapt to life on the inside.
	直到一个月后...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Wasn't until a month went by before he opened his mouth...
	他主动才找人攀谈\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	to say more than two words to somebody.
	那个人...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	As it turned out...
	就是我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	that somebody was me.
	我叫安迪·杜弗伦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm Andy Dufresne.
	杀妻的银行家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Wife-killing banker.
	为了什么?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Why'd you do it?
	我没犯罪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I didn't, since you ask.
	你来对地方了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You're going to fit right in.
	这里人人都无罪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Everybody in here's innocent. Didn't you know that?
	-赫伍  你为何入狱?  -我无罪  被律师害了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-What you in here for?  -Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.
	听说你颇爱耍酷\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.
	难道你的屁比别人香?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You think your shit smells sweeter than most. Is that right?
	你说呢?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What do you think?
	说老实话  我还不清楚\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	To tell you the truth, I haven't made up my mind.
	我知道你很有办法\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.
	我能够让你有求必应\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm known to locate certain things from time to time.
	我想要一把石捶\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.
	什么?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What?
	石捶\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A rock hammer.
	-用来干什么?  -何必问呢?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-What is it and why?  -What do you care?
	若是牙刷  我就直接报价\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask. I'd quote a price.
	因为牙刷不危险  对吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But a toothbrush is a non-lethal object, isn't it?
	也有道理\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Fair enough.
	石捶大约六  七寸长\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A rock hammer is about six or seven inches long.
	-像鹤嘴锄  -鹤嘴锄?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Looks like a miniature pickax.  -Pickax?
	敲石头用的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	For rocks.
	石英?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Quartz?
	石英\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Quartz
	云母  页岩...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And some mica, shale...
	石灰石\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	limestone.
	所以呢?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So?
	我曾是石痴\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So I'm a rock hound.
	我想重拾往日嗜好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	At least I was in my old life. I'd like to be again.
	我看你是想捶人家脑袋\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy into somebody's skull.
	不是的  这儿没有人犯着我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No, I have no enemies here.
	没有? 且慢\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No? Wait a while.
	话已传开了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Word gets around.
	三姐妹对你有性趣\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.
	尤其是包格斯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Especially Bogs.
	我会告诉他们我不是同性恋 我帮不了他们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Don't suppose it would help if I told them I'm not homosexual.
	他们也不是\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Neither are they.
	同性恋也是人  但他们是禽兽\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You have to be human first. They don't qualify.
	想干就干  根本不在乎你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Bull queers take by force. That's all they want or understand.
	我若是你  便会加倍提防\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If I were you, I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.
	-谢谢你的忠告  -反正不用钱\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Thanks for the advice.  -Well, that's free.
	你明白我的顾虑吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You understand my concern.
	我不用石捶惹事  行吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If there's trouble, I won't use the rock hammer.
	那你想逃狱  挖地道?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Then I'd guess you want to escape. Tunnel under the wall, maybe.
	有什么好笑?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What did I miss?  What's so funny?
	你看到它就明白了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You'll understand when you see the rock hammer.
	它市价多少?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What's an item like this usually go for?
	奇石店卖七元\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.
	我通常加两成\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	My normal markup's 20 percent.
	不过嘛\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But this is a specialty item.
	价钱随风险调高  跟你收十元吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Risk goes up, price goes up. Let's make it an even 10 bucks.
	就这样\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Ten it is.
	其实你是白花钱\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Waste of money, if you ask me.
	为什么?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Why's that?
	狱方喜欢突袭搜房\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.
	找到石捶一定没收\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They find it, you're going to lose it.
	到时候别摆我道\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If they catch you, you don't know me.
	否则再也别想跟我做生意\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mention my name, we never do business again.
	连口香糖都不卖你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum. Now you got that?
	我懂\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I understand.
	你叫..\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Thank you, Mr...
	瑞德\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Red.
	叫我瑞德\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Name's Red.
	瑞德\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Red
	为何叫瑞德?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Why do they call you that?
	也许我是爱尔兰人吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Maybe it's because I'm Irish.
	怪不得有人认为他臭屁\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby.
	他闷声不响的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He had a quiet way about him...
	他的步伐和谈吐简直是异类\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.
	他像...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He strolled...
	在公园散步  无忧无虑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	like a man in the park without a care or a worry in the world.
	仿佛身披隐形衣\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.
	没错\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	yes
	我打一开始...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I think it'd be fair to say...
	就喜欢他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I liked Andy from the start.
	别耽误我们时间\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let's go! Some of us got a schedule to keep.
	快点 快点\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Move it! Come on, move it!
	最近好吗? 你老婆对你怎么样?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	How you doing? How's the wife treating you?
	继续走\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	keep moving
	继续走\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	just go
	瑞德\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Red
	安迪说的对\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Andy was right.
	见到货就明白\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I finally got the joke.
	用它挖地道...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It would take a man about 600 years...
	得挖六百年\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	to tunnel under the wall with one of these.
	-要书吗?  -不要\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Book?  -Not today.
	-要书吗?  -不要\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Book? -Not
	老布\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Brook
	给杜弗伦的货\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Delivery for Dufresne.
	要书吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Book?
	要书吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Book?
	杜弗伦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Dufresne
	你的书\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Here's your book.
	谢谢\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Thanks.
	杜弗伦  漂白粉不够了  你去后面拿点\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We're running low on hexite. Get on back and fetch us up some.
	这东西会弄瞎你的眼睛\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This will blind you.
	宝贝  别这样\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Honey, hush.
	你反抗\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's it. You fight!
	那更刺激\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Better that way.
	我也希望另一种结局...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I wish I could tell you Andy fought the good fight...
	就是安迪打赢  全身而退\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and the Sisters let him be.
	我希望如此\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I wish I could tell you that...
	然而监狱不是童话世界\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	but prison is no fairy-tale world.
	他从没说过是谁干的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He never said who did it.
	但谁都明白\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But we all knew.
	日子就这样一天天过去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Things went on like that for a while.
	监狱生活就像例行公事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Prison life consists of routine...
	除此之外还是例行公事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and then more routine.
	安迪脸上身上时时带着伤\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises.
	三姐妹不放过他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The Sisters kept at him.
	他有时打赢\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sometimes he was able to fight them off.
	有时吃败仗\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sometimes not.
	这就是安迪的监狱生活\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And that's how it went for Andy.
	这就是他的例行公事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That was his routine.
	我相信最初那两年是他最糟糕的两年\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I do believe those first two years were the worst for him.
	我也相信如果日子继续这样过下去的话\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And I also believe that if things had gone on that way...
	这个地方早晚会把他给毁了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	this place would have got the best of him.
	不过  在1949年的春天...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But then, in the spring of 1949...
	监狱管理层决定\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	the powers that be decided:
	车牌厂的屋顶需要修整\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing.
	我需要12名志愿者工作一周\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.
	你们都知道...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	As you know...
	特别的公差享特别的待遇\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	special detail carries with it special privileges.
	这是户外公差\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It was outdoor detail...
	而五月是户外活动的好月份  实在求之不得\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and May is one damned fine month to be working outdoors.

	Why me? Why now?
	不知道\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't know.

	So...
	狄金斯先生...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mister Dekins...
	然后安迪说...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And then Andy says, "Mr. Dekins...
	你想让公子进哈佛或耶鲁?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	do you want your sons to go to Harvard or Yale?"
	你少瞎扯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He didn't say that!
	真的  老天为证\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	As God as my witness!
	他愣了一下\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Dekins blinked for a second...
	傻笑出来  后来他真的跟安迪握手\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	then he laughed and actually shook Andy's hand.
	-握你的鸟  -真的握手\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-My ass!  -Shook his hand.
	我乐的差点尿出来\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I tell you, I near soiled myself!
	若给安迪弄一套西装领带...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	All he needed was a suit and tie and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...
	他就成了咨询先生\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	he'd have been "Mr. Dufresne," if you please.
	开始交新朋友了  安迪?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Making a few friends?
	也不算朋友\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I wouldn't say "friends."
	我是精通理财的囚徒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.
	这种本事很受用\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's a wonderful pet to have.
	起码不用干洗衣工\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Got you out of the laundry, though.
	还派得上更大用场\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It might do more than that.
	比如扩建图书馆  买新书\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	How about expanding the library. Get some new books.
	还不如要个撞球桌\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If you ask for something, ask for a pool table.
	对\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	yes

	找典狱长要钱\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'll ask the warden for funds.
	少年呀  我经历六个典狱长\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Six wardens have been through here in my tenure, and I've learned...
	我学到互古不变的真理\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	one immutable, universal truth:
	给钱是不可能的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not one born whose asshole...
	他们没一个生来有屁眼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	wouldn't pucker up tighter than a snare drum when you ask for funds.
	-预算太少了  -我了解\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-The budget's stretched thin as it is.  -I see.
	我可以写信跟州议会要钱\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Maybe I could write the state senate and request funds from them.
	监狱领到款只能做三种用途\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They have only three ways to spend the taxpayers' money for prisons:
	筑高墙  加牢笼  添警卫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	More walls, more bars, more guards.
	我仍请您恩准  一周一信\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'd like to try, with permission. A letter a week.
	-总会有结果  -难说哦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-They can't ignore me forever.  -Sure can.
	想写就写吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But you write your letters if it makes you happy.
	我一定寄出  行吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'll even mail them for you. How's that?
	安迪开始一周一信\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So Andy started writing a letter a week...
	他说话算话\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	just like he said.
	不过  就像诺顿说的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And like Norton said...
	毫无回音\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Andy got no answers.
	次年  他替半数的警卫报税\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The following April, he did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank.
	再过一年  全都找他帮忙\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Year after that, he did them all...
	包括典狱长的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	including the warden's.
	再过一年的狱际棒球赛\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Year after that, they rescheduled the intramural season...
	改在与税季重叠\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	to coincide with tax season.
	各监狱的警卫都带税单找他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their W-2s.
	狱方发枪给你...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So Moresby Prison...
	但要你付钱\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	issued you a gun, but you paid for it.
	连枪套也要我付\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Right. The holster too.
	这笔钱可扣除\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's tax-deductible. You can write that off.
	没错  安迪就像家庭工业\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes, sir! Andy was a regular cottage industry.
	税季繁忙时  还可请助手\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	In fact, it got so busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff.
	请帮我拿一叠表格\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Could you hand me a stack of 1040s?
	每年此时我调离工厂  我乐到心坎里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year, and that was fine by me.
	至于信  他仍继续寄\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And still, he kept sending those letters.
	瑞德  安迪  布鲁克出事了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's Brooks.
	守着门\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Watch the door.
	布鲁克\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Please, Brooks.
	-你他妈的别冲动嘛  -混帐  退后\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Calm the fuck down.  -Stay back!
	-混蛋  退后!  -怎么了?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Stay back, goddamn it!  -What's going on?
	好好的  突然亮刀子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	One second he's fine, then out come the knives.
	布鲁克  有话好说\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We can talk about this, right?
	放屁  没啥可说  我要割断他喉咙\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's nothing to talk about. I'll cut his fucking throat.
	等一下  赫伍哪里不对?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What's he done to you?
	错在他们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's what they done!
	我别无选择\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I got no choice.
	谁都知道你不会伤害他  对吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You won't hurt Heywood. We all know that.
	-对  我了解  -为何你不会伤害他?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Right, Heywood?  -Sure.
	因为他是朋友  而你明理\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's a friend of yours, and Brooks is a reasonable man.
	-有道理  对不对?  -对\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Right, guys?
	布鲁克  看着我  放下刀\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So put the knife down. Look at me.
	那就把刀放下\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Put the knife down.
	布鲁克  你瞧他的脖子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Look at his neck, for God's sake.
	他都流血了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Look at his neck. He's bleeding.
	只有闯祸...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's the only way...
	才能留在牢里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	they'd let me stay.
	怎么会?  别做傻事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This is crazy. You don't want to do this.
	把刀放下吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Put it, put it down.
	放轻松一点\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Take it easy.
	不会有事的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You'll be all right.
	他没事  我呢?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Him? What about me?
	老疯狗差点割断我喉咙\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!
	你刮胡子不也刀刀见血\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You've had worse from shaving.
	你怎样惹毛他的?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What did you do to set him off?
	哪有  我只是来道别\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Nothing. I come in here to say farewell.
	上面准他假释了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.
	我实在搞不明白\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I just don't understand what happened in there.
	这老家伙简直疯了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse.
	赫伍  住口\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's enough out of you.
	-听说你吓的屁滚尿流  -滚你的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Heard he had you shitting your pants. -Fuck you.
	别斗嘴了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	IKnock it off.
	布鲁克没疯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Brooks ain't no bug.
	他只是...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	he is just...
	体制化了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	institutionalized.
	什么鸟词儿嘛\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	"Institutionalized," my ass.
	他坐了50年的牢  50年呀\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood, 50 years!
	成了井底之蛙\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	This is all he knows.
	他念过书...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	In here, he's an important man...
	在狱中有地位\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	an educated man.
	出狱就成了废人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Outside, he's nothing.
	双手犯关节炎的囚徒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.
	想向图书馆借书都会被拒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.
	这样说你懂吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You know what I'm trying to say?
	我才不懂你的满嘴屁话\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I do believe you're talking out of your ass.
	随你怎么说\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You believe whatever you want.
	监狱是怪地方\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But I tell you these walls are funny.
	起先你恨它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	First you hate them.
	然后习惯它\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Then you get used to them.
	更久后...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Enough time passes...
	你离不开他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	you get so you depend on them.
	这就叫体制化\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's "institutionalized."
	狗屎\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Shit.
	-我才不会呢  -是吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-I could never get like that. -Oh, yeah?
	等你待到布鲁克那把年纪 你就知道了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Wait till you've been here as long as Brooks.
	说的太对了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Goddamn right.
	他们把你关一辈子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They send you here for life...
	你的一生都被剥夺了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	that's exactly what they take.
	至少是一大部分\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Part that counts, anyway.
	杰克  我无法再照顾你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I can't take care of you no more, Jake.
	走吧  你自由了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You go on now.

	当包装员\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	bagging groceries at the Food-Way.
	工作辛苦  我很努力\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's hard work and I try to keep up...
	但双手一直犯疼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	..but my hands hurt most of the time.
	叫他务必用双层袋\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Make sure your man double-bags.
	上次差点撑破袋子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Last time, the bottom near came out.
	确定要用双层袋\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Make sure you double-bag like the lady says. understand?
	是  没问题\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes, sir. Surely will.
	店长不怎么喜欢我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't think the store manager likes me very much.
	下工后我去公园喂鸟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sometimes after work, I go to the park and feed the birds.
	盼望...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I keep thinking...
	杰克来打个招呼\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Jake might just show up and say hello.
	但他没出现过\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But he never does.
	不管他在何处  我祝他过的好  有新朋友\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay and making new friends.
	我夜间难以入眠\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have trouble sleeping at night.
	做着从高处坠落的恶梦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have bad dreams like I'm falling.
	醒时恐惧莫名\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I wake up scared.
	有时记不起身在何方\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am.
	也许我该持枪抢劫\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Maybe I should get a gun and rob the Food-Way so they'd send me home.
	毙了店长  重回肖申克  杀了他锦上添花\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I could shoot the manager while I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.
	我老的无法再胡闹了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore.
	我不喜欢这里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	我厌倦成天担惊受怕\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided...
	于是  我决心不再逗留\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	not to stay.
	当局不会在乎我...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...
	一个糟老头算什么\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	not for an old crook like me.
	老布来此一游\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Brook was here

	P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.
	别记恨在心\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No hard feelings. Brooks."
	他还不如老死在肖申克好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He should have died in here.
	你在干什么?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What the fuck have you done?
	一片混乱\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's a goddamn mess, I'll tell you that.
	-这些是什么?  -你说呢  全是寄给你的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-What's all this?  -You tell me. They're addressed to you.
	你看\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	We trust this will fill your needs. We now consider the matter closed.
	请勿再来信\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Please stop sending us letters."
	典狱长回来前清干净\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Clear all this out before the warden gets back.
	是的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes, sir.
	干的好  安迪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Good for you, Andy.
	哇!\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Wow!
	只写了六年\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It only took six years.
	现在起我一周两信\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	From now on, I'll write two letters a week instead of one.
	你真够固执的  听队长的话...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I believe you're crazy enough.  Get this stuff out...
	把东西清干净  我去撇大条\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	like he said.I've got to pinch a loaf.
	别让我出来...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	When I come back...

	Do you hear that?
	杜弗伦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Dufresne!
	安迪  放我出去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Andy, let me out!
	安迪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Andy
	我从未搞懂她们唱什么\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about.
	其实我也不想弄懂\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Truth is, I don't want to know.
	此时无言胜有言\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Some things are best left unsaid.
	她们唱出...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I like to think it was something so beautiful...
	难以言传的美\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	it can't be expressed in words...
	美的令你心碎\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and makes your heart ache because of it.
	歌声直窜云端\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I tell you, those voices soared...
	超越失意囚徒的梦想\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream.
	宛如小鸟飞入牢房\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It was like a beautiful bird flapped into our drab cage...
	使石墙消失无踪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and made those walls dissolve away.
	就在这一瞬间\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And for the briefest of moments...
	肖申克众囚仿佛重获自由\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	every last man at Shawshank felt free.
	典狱长可发飚了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It pissed the warden off something awful.
	开门\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Open the door.
	开门呀\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	-看谁来了  -大指挥家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Hey, look who's here.  -Maestro!
	你没别的可放吗?  比如汉克威廉斯的歌\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You couldn't play something good, huh? Like Hank Williams?
	来不及接受点歌就被逮了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They broke the door down before I could take requests.
	-关两周值得吗?  -我最舒服的两周\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Was it worth two weeks?  -Easiest time I ever did.
	-屁话  独囚最难熬了  -在里面度日如年呀\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-No such thing as easy time in the hole. -A week in the hole is like a year.
	-最难熬了  -有莫札特陪我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Damn straight.  -I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.
	他们准你带电唱机?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So they let you tote that record player down there, huh?
	在脑中\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It was in here.
	在心底\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	In here.
	音乐之美\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's the beauty of music. They...
	是夺不走的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	can't get that from you.
	你没体会过吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Haven't you ever felt that way about music?
	我年轻时吹口琴\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Well, I played a mean harmonica as a younger man.
	没兴致了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Lost interest in it, though.
	在牢里也没意义\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Didn't make much sense in here.
	就是在这里才有意义\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Here's where it makes the most sense.
	有音乐才不会忘记\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You need it so you don't forget.

	In 1959, the state senate finally clued in to the fact...
	两百元无法打发安迪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	当局决议每年付五百元...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of $500...
	好让安迪封笔\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	-这种派他收过很多  -你听说的只是皮毛\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what I hear.
	他干的坏事你想不到  重重的回扣\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of. IKickbacks on his kickbacks.
	黑钱如河般在他脚下流\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A river of dirty money running through here.
	贪污这么多迟早会曝光\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sooner or later, he'll have to explain where it came from.
	因此才要用我\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's where I come in.
	我过滤黑钱  一一漂白\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.
	股票  证券  市政公债\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.
	我让脏钱流入市场  等它回流时...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I send it out into the real world, and when it comes back...
	-干净的像处女?  -比那更干净\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh?  -Cleaner.
	诺顿退休时  将是百万富翁\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	By the time Norton retires, I'll have made him a millionaire.
	若被逮到  他也会被关入肖申克\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If they ever catch on, he'll wind up in here wearing a number himself.
	你对我这么没信心呀\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I thought you had more faith in me than that.
	不  我知道你很罩  但文件会留下证据\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I know you're good, but all that paper leaves a trail.
	万一调查局或国税局起疑...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Now anybody gets curious, FBI, IRS...
	就完了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	whatever.
	总有人要遭殃\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It'll lead to somebody.
	没错  但不是我  更不是典狱长\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sure it is, but not to me, and certainly not to the warden.
	那是谁?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	All right, who?
	兰道史帝文\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Randall Stevens.
	谁?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Who?
	隐名又隐形的合伙人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The "silent" silent partner.
	法官  都怪他  户头是他的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's the guilty one, the man with the bank accounts.
	他是洗钱的起点\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's where the filtering process starts.
	出了差错  只追得到他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They trace anything, it'll just lead to him.
	但他是什么人?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But who is he?
	他是幻影  幽灵  兔宝宝的远房表亲\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's a phantom, an apparition. Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.
	我一手塑造他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I conjured him...
	凭空的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	out of thin air.
	他不存在  除了在文件上\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He doesn't exist, except on paper.
	哪有凭空造人的?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You can't just make a person up.
	利用制度的漏洞就行\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sure you can, if you know how the system works.
	靠写信能办成太多的事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.
	史帝文有出生证明\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...
	有驾照  社会保险编号\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	driver's license, Social Security.
	你没盖我吧?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You're shitting me.
	就算抓到蛛丝马迹\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If they trace any accounts, they'll wind up chasing...
	也等于捕捉影\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	a figment of my imagination.
	真想不到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Well, I'll be damned!
	我有称赞过你吧?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Did I say you were good?
	你简直是大艺术家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Shit, you are Rembrandt.
	可笑的是...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The funny thing is...
	外头  我刚正不阿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow.
	进了牢  却大搞歪哥\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I had to come to prison to be a crook.
	你心安吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Ever bother you?
	我没干坏事  只是洗钱\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't run the scams.I just process the profits.
	也许这是强词夺理\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A fine line, maybe...
	但我只手成立图书馆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	but I also built that library...
	帮助囚友考取中学文凭\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and used it to help guys get their high school diploma.
	典狱长凭什么任我做?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Why do you think he lets me do all that?
	为了使你...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	IKeep you happy and doing the laundry.
	乐于帮他洗钱\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Money instead of sheets.
	我算是便宜卖给他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Well, I work cheap. That's the tradeoff.
	汤米在65年来到肖申克...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 1965...
	犯了"破闯"判了两年\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	on a two-year stretch for B and E.
	就是强行入侵他人公宅\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's breaking and entering to you.
	他在商店后门偷彩电时被逮\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Cops caught him sneaking TV sets out the back door of a JC Penney.
	小庞克\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Young punk.
	摇滚狂一个\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...
	跩得够可爱\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	cocky as hell.
	快啦  各位老兄  慢吞吞的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Come on, old boys. Moving like molasses!
	我看了难过\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Making me look bad.
	人见人爱\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We liked him immediately.
	我退出门外  我这样抱着电视\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm backing out the door and I got the TV like this.
	它很大  害我看不见  忽然传出声音\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A big old thing. I couldn't see shit. Then I hear this voice.
	"别动  手举起来"\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	"Freeze, kid, hands in the air."
	我站着抱紧电视\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I was standing there, holding onto that TV. Finally the voice says:
	他又说"你听没有?"  我说有  但我若松手\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	"You hear what I said, boy?" I say, "Yes, sir. I did.
	就一条毁损财产罪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But if I drop this, you get me on destruction of property too."
	你在凯希曼监狱蹲过?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You done some stretch in Cashman, right?
	那是最好混的日子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yeah, that was an easy piece of time, let me tell you.
	周末回家  外役制度\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Weekend furloughs. Work programs.
	不像这里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not like here.
	你哪里都蹲过嘛\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sounds like you done time all over.
	我13岁起以牢为家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I've been in and out since I was 13.
	你想的到的监狱我都待过\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Name it, chances are I've been there.
	也许你该改行了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Perhaps you should try a new profession.
	依我看\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What I mean is...
	你的贼功不灵光  该做做别的事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	you're not a very good thief.You should try something else.
	你懂个屁  你是卡彭呀?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yeah, what the hell you know about it, Capone?
	你为何入狱?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What are you in for?
	我?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Me?
	被律师害了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	A lawyer fucked me.
	肖申克没人有罪  你不懂吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Everybody's innocent in here. Don't you know that?
	汤米有娇妻和一女儿\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	As it turned out, Tommy had himself a young wife and a new baby girl.
	他怕妻女流落街头\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Maybe he thought of them on the streets...
	不认识老爸\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.
	或是别的原因\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Whatever it was...
	反正这小子卯上了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	something lit a fire under that boy's ass.
	我想考同等学历\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Thought I might try for my high school equivalency.
	听说你帮过人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.
	我不帮废人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.
	我才不是废人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I ain't no goddamn loser.
	-你有心?  -对\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-You mean that?  -Yeah.
	真的有心?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You really mean that?
	是的  我有\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Yes, sir, I do.
	好  要冲就冲到底\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Good. Because if we do this...
	百分之百  不可退却\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	we do it all the way, a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.
	问题是...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Thing is, see...
	我不太识字\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't read so good.
	没关系\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	"Well."
	你...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You don't read...
	不识字\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	so well.
	交给我吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We'll get to that.
	安迪收汤米为徒\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So Andy took Tommy under his wing.
	从字母教起\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Started walking him through his ABC's.
	汤米学的非常好\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Tommy took to it pretty well too.
	他从未发现自己有天份\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Boy found brains he never knew he had.
	没多久就始准备应试\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Before long, Andy started him on his course requirements.
	安迪真心喜欢他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He really liked the kid.
	助人向上令他兴奋\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shit heap.
	但动机不止于此\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But that wasn't the only reason.
	牢狱生活缓慢得很\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Prison time is slow time.
	必须找事打发时间\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So you do what you can to keep going.
	有人集邮\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Some fellas collect stamps.
	有人盖火柴屋\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Others build matchstick houses.
	安迪成立了图书馆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Andy built a library.
	如今他需要新计划\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Now he needed a new project.
	就是汤米\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Tommy was it.
	这跟他长年刻石一样\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks.
	也跟他挂美女图一样\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.
	在牢里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	In prison...
	没事也得找事做\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	a man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied.
	1966年  就在汤米应考之前...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	By 1966, right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams...
	换上拉寇儿薇芝了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	it was lovely Raquel.
	时间到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Time.
	怎样?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Well?
	烂透了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Well, it's for shit.
	我他妈白费一整年\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I wasted a whole year of my time with this bullshit.
	也许没那么糟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's probably not that bad.
	更糟啦  没一题做对  简直像中文一样看不懂\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I didn't get a thing right.It might as well have been in Chinese.
	分数出来再说\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let's see how the score comes out.
	我告诉你几分吧\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'll tell you how the goddamn score comes out.
	两分入网\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Two points, right there!
	这就是分数\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's your goddamn score!
	什么猫爬树  五五二十五\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Goddamn cats crawling up trees,5 times 5 is 25...
	去他妈的蛋\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Fuck this place!
	去他妈的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Fuck it!
	真后悔\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I feel bad.
	让他失望\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I let him down.
	胡说\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's crap, kid.
	他以你为荣\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's proud of you.
	多年的交情  我摸透他了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	We're old friends,I know him as good as anybody.
	他是聪明人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Smart fellow, ain't he?
	绝顶聪明  曾是银行家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Smart as they come. He was a banker on the outside.
	他究竟为何入狱?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What's he in here for anyway?
	谋杀\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Murder.
	你少扯了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	The hell, you say.
	看他外表是想不到\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.
	捉到老婆跟高球教练在床  两个全干了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Caught his wife in bed with some golf pro. Greased them both.
	怎么了?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What?
	大约四年前...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	About four years ago...
	我在汤犸斯监狱服刑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.
	我偷了车\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I stole a car.
	实在愚蠢\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.
	剩下半年时...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	About six months left to go...
	来了新室友\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I get a new cellmate in.
	名叫厄摩\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Elmo Blatch.
	大个子  紧张狂\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Big, twitchy fucker.
	谁都怕碰上这种室友\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	IKind of roomie you pray you don't get. You know what I'm saying?
	入室行窃  服刑6至12年\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.
	他说他干过好几百票\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.
	想不到有那么神经的人  闻到屁味也跳到半天高\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.
	他的嘴永远闭不上\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Talked all the time too. That's the other thing. He never shut up.
	他去过的地方...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Places he'd been in...
	犯的罪  玩过的女人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.
	甚至杀过的人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Even people he killed.
	他说杀人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	People who "gave him shit."
	是因为不爽\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's how he put it.
	有一晚  我当做玩笑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So one night, like a joke...
	我问他"你杀过谁?"\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I say to him,"Elmo, who did you kill?"
	他说...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So he says:
	我在俱乐部收盘子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I got me this job one time,busing tables at a country club...
	趁机观察阔人下手\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	so I could case all these bigrich pricks that come in.
	我相中一人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So I pick out this guy...
	在晚上...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	go in one night...
	摸进他家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and do his place.
	他醒来...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He wakes up...
	惹的我不爽\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and gives me shit.
	我就宰了他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	So I killed him.
	和他身边那骚货\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Him and this tasty bitch he was with.
	精彩的是...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And that's the best part.
	她搞上高球教练\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	She's fucking this prick, see...
	家有老公\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	this golf pro,but she's married to some other guy.
	一个大银行家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Some hotshot banker.
	却成了代罪羔羊\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And he's the one they pinned it on.
	我从未听过如此惊人的故事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have to say that's the most amazing story I ever heard.
	最惊人的是你居然受骗\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What amazes me most is you'd be taken in by it.
	什么?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sir?
	显然汤米对你颇有好感\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you.
	知道你痛苦  自然想让你高兴\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He hears your tale of woe and naturally wants to cheer you up.
	他还小  脑筋不太灵光\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He's young, not terribly bright.
	根本不明会害苦了你\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It's not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he put you in.
	他说的是实情\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Sir, he's telling the truth.
	就算真有厄摩这人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Let's say for the moment this Blatch does exist.
	难道他会跪地哭诉  "是我杀的  我忏悔"\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess.
	"顺便再给我加个无期徒刑吧"\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	By the way, add a life term to my sentence."
	这无所谓 只要有汤米的证词 我就可以要求重审\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	With Tommy's testimony,I can get a new trial.
	但你得找到厄摩\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's assuming Blatch is still there.
	他可能早就出狱了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Chances are, he'd be released by now.
	但能查到住址和亲友  这是机会呀\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	They'd have his last known address.It's a chance, isn't it?
	你真是个阿呆\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	How can you be so obtuse?
	什么?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What?
	你说我什么?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	What did you call me?
	你笨蛋  我说错了吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Obtuse. Is it deliberate?
	你别忘了身份\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	You're forgetting yourself.

	What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"?Don't say that to me.
	你再说就试试看\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	All they found was a muddy set of prison clothes...
	一块肥皂\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	a bar of soap...
	一把石捶\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	and an old rock hammer...
	一把几乎解体的石捶\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	我曾夸口要花六百年才挖的通的隧道...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I had thought it'd take a man 600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.
	安迪花了不到20年\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Old Andy did it in less than 20.
	他喜爱研究地质\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Oh, Andy loved geology.
	碎石令他想一探究竟\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.

	An ice age here...
	冰河时代\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	million years of mountain building there.

	就我说的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Like I said...
	在牢里  没事也得找事做\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	in prison, a man will do anything to keep his mind occupied.
	原来的安迪的嗜好...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting his wall out into the exercise yard...
	就是一点一滴倾倒废土\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	a handful at a time.
	大概就在汤米死后...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I guess after Tommy was killed...
	安迪决定不再久留\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Andy decided he'd been here long enough.
	动作快  我要回家\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	I mean, seriously...
	谁会注意别人的鞋子\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	how often do you really look at a man's shoes?
	安迪就这样爬向自由\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards...
	在恶臭中匍匐五百码\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.
	要我爬才不干\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Or maybe I just don't want to.
	五百码\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Five hundred yards.
	五座橄榄球场宽\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's the length of five football fields.
	几乎长达半里\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	a man nobody ever laid eyes on before...
	走进缅因国家银行\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	strolled into the Maine National Bank.
	在那之前  他不是实体\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Until that moment, he didn't exist.
	-只存在于文件上  -有何干贵?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	-Except on paper. -May I help you?
	他各种证件都有\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He had all the proper ID...

	签名分毫不差\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	Severance pay for 19 years.
	早上好 这里是波特兰日报\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.
	你是海利吗?  你有权保持沉默\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Byron Hadley? You have the right to remain silent.
	从现在起 你所说的一切 都将可能成为法庭上对你不利的证词\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	If you give up this right, anything you say can be held against you in court.
	当时我没有在场  后来听说...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I wasn't there to see, but I hear Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...
	海利利被人带走的时候竟然哭得像个老娘们\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	when they took him away.
	诺顿却无意乖乖就范\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Norton had no intention of going that quietly.

	我不清楚哪一把\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I'm not sure which key.
	诺顿 拒捕是罪上加罪\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Make it easy on yourself, Norton!
	我猜他脑中最后一件事...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I like to think the last thing that went through his head...
	除了枪子儿...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	other than that bullet...
	就是在想安迪为何能整倒他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.
	典狱长见阎王之后不久\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not long after the warden deprived us of his company...
	我收到一张明信片\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I got a postcard in the mail.
	没写字  但有邮戳\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It was blank,but the postmark said...

	Fort Hancock...
	就在边境线上\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	right on the border.
	是安迪出境的地方\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	That's where Andy crossed.
	一想到 他开着敞篷车 疾驶而去的神情\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down...
	我就忍不住发笑\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	it always makes me laugh.
	安迪·杜弗伦\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Andy Dufresne...

	Hadley's got him by the throat, right?
	"他活的不耐烦了"\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	He says, "I believe this boy's about to have himself an accident."
	老友们常聊起他\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Those of us who knew him best talk about him often.
	他那些惊人之举\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I swear, the stuff he pulled...
	"请我朋友喝啤酒吧"\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	"My friends could use a couple of beers."
	真的做到了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And he got it!

	Sometimes it makes me sad, though...
	令我感伤\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Andy being gone.
	有些鸟儿是不应该被关在笼子里的\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged.
	因为它们的羽毛太丰润了\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Their feathers are just too bright.
	当他们飞走...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	And when they fly away...
	你会由衷地庆贺他获得自由\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.
	无奈的是...\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	But still...
	你得继续在这乏味之地苟活\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	Rehabilitated?
	噢 让我想想\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Well, now, let me see.
	我不大明白这个词的含义\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I don't have any idea what that means.
	就是说准备好重返社会\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	It means you're ready to rejoin society...
	我当然明白你的意思 年轻人\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	I know what you think it means, sonny.
	对我而言 这只是个术语\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	To me it's just a made-up word.
	就像政治家那些术语\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	你后悔吗?\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Well, are you?
	我没有一天不后悔\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.
	但并非受惩罚才后悔\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	Not because I'm in here or because you think I should.
	我回首前尘往事\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	That kid's long gone...
	只剩下我垂老之躯\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	There's a harsh truth to face.
	我根本混不下去\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	No way I'm going to make it on the outside.
	我一心想违犯假释\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}
	All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole...
	也许能重返肖申克\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	活在恐惧中真是糟糕\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}

	杜弗伦先生  请你描述...\N
	Mr. Dufresne, describe...
	命案当晚和妻子争吵的情形\N
	the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered.
	我们吵的很凶\N
	It was very bitter.
	她说不怕我知道  她讨厌偷偷摸摸\N
	She said she was glad I knew,that she hated all the sneaking around.
	她还说  想去雷诺市办离婚\N
	And she said that she wanted a divorce in Reno.
	-你怎样回答?  -我拒绝离婚\N
	-What was your response?  -I told her I would not grant one.
	"你别想活着去雷诺市"\N
	"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."
	邻居作证你说过这句话\N
	Those were your words, according to your neighbors.
	也许吧\N
	If they say so.
	我气炸了  记不清楚\N
	I really don't remember. I was upset.
	你们吵完以后呢?\N
	What happened after you argued with your wife?
	她收拾行李\N
	She packed a bag.
	去跟昆丁先生住一起\N
	She packed a bag to go and stay with Mr. Quentin.
	葛兰昆丁  乡村俱乐部的高球教练\N
	Glenn Quentin, golf pro at the Snowden Hills Country Club...
	你最近才发现  他是你太太的情夫\N
	whom you had discovered was your wife's lover.
	你跟踪她吗?\N
	Did you follow her?
	我先去酒吧买醉\N
	I went to a few bars first.
	然后去他家  但没人在\N
	Later, I drove to his house to confront them. They weren't home.
	我停了车\N
	I parked in the turnout...
	等他们\N
	and waited.
	用意何在?\N
	With what intention?
	我不确定\N
	I'm not sure.
	我醉了\N
	I was confused...
	糊里糊涂\N
	drunk.
	我想...\N
	I think...
	最多只是吓吓他们\N
	mostly I wanted to scare them.
	结果他们一回来  你就冲进屋杀了他们\N
	When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them.
	不  我逐渐酒醒\N
	I was sobering up.
	开车回家睡觉\N
	I got back in the car and I drove home to sleep it off.
	路中把枪丢入皇家河\N
	Along the way, I threw my gun into the Royal River.
	我已讲的很清楚\N
	I've been very clear on this point.
	但清洁妇隔天早晨上工时\N
	I get hazy where the cleaning woman shows up the following morning...
	发现床上的双尸\N
	and finds your wife in bed with her lover...
	身上满是点三八的弹孔\N
	riddled with.38-caliber bullets.
	你不觉得这很巧吗?  还是只有我这么想?\N
	Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?
	是很巧\N
	Yes, it does.
	但你仍声称早在案发之前\N
	Yet you still maintain you threw your gun into the river...
	就已丢弃了枪\N
	before the murders took place.
	这种说法倒是很省事\N
	That's very convenient.
	这是实话\N
	It's the truth.
	警方打捞三天都没找到\N
	The police dragged that river for three days, and nary a gun was found...
	这样就无法比对\N
	so no comparison could be made
	你的手枪和\N
	between your gun and the bullets...
	受害者尸体上的弹痕\N
	taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims.
	所以呢\N
	And that also...
	这样也非常省事  不是吗  杜弗伦先生?\N
	is very convenient. Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?
	我是清白的\N
	Since I am innocent of this crime...
	所以找不到枪反倒对我非常不利\N
	I find it decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found.
	一切证据都向各位报告了\N
	Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence.
	脚印和胎痕证明被告在场\N
	We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have footprints.
	散落地面的子弹上有他的指纹\N
	Bullets on the ground bearing his fingerprints.
	酒瓶碎片上同样也有指痕\N
	A broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints.
	最重要的是...\N
	And most of all...
	一位美女与情夫...\N
	we have a beautiful young woman and her lover...
	相拥而死\N
	lying dead in each other's arms.
	他们是有伤风化\N
	They had sinned.
	但是...\N
	But was their crime so great...
	罪该致死吗?\N
	as to merit a death sentence?
	请各位与此同时...\N
	While you think about that...
	再考虑一件事\N
	think about this:
	一只左轮手枪只能装六发子弹  而非八发\N
	A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.
	所以他并非一时冲动\N
	I submit that this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion.\N{\fe238}{\fn黑体}{\fs14}{\b1}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\3c&H2F2F2F&}{\4c&H000000&}改编自斯蒂芬·金的短篇小说《丽塔海华丝及萧山克监狱的救赎》
	冲动并不可宽恕  但可理解\N
	That at least could be understood, if not condoned.
	然而...\N
	No.
	这是复仇\N
	This was revenge...
	残忍而冷血的谋杀  想想看\N
	of a much more brutal, cold-blooded nature. Consider this:
	这两人各中四枪\N
	Four bullets per victim.
	共八枪  而非六枪\N
	Not six shots fired, but eight.
	因此他是先射完一轮\N
	That means that he fired the gun empty...
	再装弹补上两枪\N
	and then stopped to reload...
	然后再一人添一枪\N
	so that he could shoot each of them again. An extra bullet per lover...
	射穿脑袋\N
	right in the head.
	你面目冷漠  全无悔意  杜弗伦先生\N
	You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.
	看见你就令我齿冷\N
	It chills my blood just to look at you.
	根据缅因州赋予我的权力...\N
	By the power vested in me by the state of Maine...
	我判处你两次终身监禁 按序执行\N
	I hereby order you to serve two life sentences back-to-back...
	每名受害者一次  退庭!\N
	one for each of your victims. So be it!
	坐下\N
	Sit.
	根据你的材料 你的终身监禁已经服满20年\N
	We see you've served 20 years of a life sentence?
	-是的  -你改过自新了吗?\N
	-Yes, sir.  -You feel you've been rehabilitated?
	是的  改造好了\N
	Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.
	我已得到深刻教训\N
	I mean, I learned my lesson.
	真的  我已洗心革面\N
	I can honestly say that I'm a changed man.
	我不会再做危害社会的事了\N
	I'm no longer a danger to society.
	我向上帝发誓\N
	That's God's honest truth.
	瑞德\N
	Hey, Red.

	How'd it go?

	我上周才假释被拒\N

	It happens.
	嗨，瑞德，借一包烟吧\N
	Hey, Red, bump me a deck.
	滚开  你欠我五包\N
	Get out of my face, man! You're into me for five packs already.
	-四包  -五包\N
	-Four!  -Five!
	美国每个监狱里可能都会有我这样的人\N
	There must be a con like me in every prison in America.
	我能为你弄到各种东西\N
	I'm the guy who can get it for you.
	香烟啦  大麻啦\N
	Cigarettes, a bag of reefer, if that's your thing...
	家有喜事想喝白兰地也行\N
	bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation.
	几乎是任何合理的东西\N
	Damn near anything within reason.
	是的 先生  我就像百货公司\N
	Yes, sir! I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.
	所以1949年  安迪·杜弗伦...\N
	So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949...
	让我替他弄张丽塔·海华丝的电影海报\N
	and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...
	我立刻回答 没问题!\N
	I told him, "No problem."
	大家到大门口集合\N
	to the main gate
	到大门口集合\N

	安迪在47年初入肖申克监狱\N
	Andy came to Shawshank Prison...
	因为杀害老婆和情夫\N
	in early 1947 for murdering his wife and the fella she was banging.
	他本来是缅因州一家大银行的副总裁\N
	On the outside, he'd been vice president of a large Portland bank.
	年轻有为 前程远大\N
	Good work for a man so young.

	石捶大约六  七寸长\N

	No, I have no enemies here.
	没有? 且慢\N

	因为他是朋友  而你明理\N
	He's a friend of yours, and Brooks is a reasonable man.

	双手犯关节炎的囚徒\N
	Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.
	想向图书馆借书都会被拒\N
	Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.
	这样说你懂吗?\N
	You know what I'm trying to say?
	我才不懂你的满嘴屁话\N
	I do believe you're talking out of your ass.
	随你怎么说\N
	You believe whatever you want.
	监狱是怪地方\N
	But I tell you these walls are funny.
	起先你恨它\N

	说的太对了\N
	Goddamn right.
	他们把你关一辈子\N
	They send you here for life...

	实在愚蠢\N
	It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.
	剩下半年时...\N
	About six months left to go...
	来了新室友\N
	I get a new cellmate in.
	名叫厄摩\N

	IKind of roomie you pray you don't get. You know what I'm saying?
	入室行窃  服刑6至12年\N
	Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

	Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.
	想不到有那么神经的人  闻到屁味也跳到半天高\N
	Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.
	他的嘴永远闭不上\N
	Talked all the time too. That's the other thing. He never shut up.
	他去过的地方...\N
	Places he'd been in...
	犯的罪  玩过的女人\N
	jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.
	甚至杀过的人\N
	Even people he killed.
	他说杀人\N
	People who "gave him shit."
	是因为不爽\N
	That's how he put it.
	有一晚  我当做玩笑\N
	So one night, like a joke...
	我问他"你杀过谁?"\N
	I say to him,"Elmo, who did you kill?"
	他说...\N
	So he says:
	我在俱乐部收盘子\N
	I got me this job one time,busing tables at a country club...
	趁机观察阔人下手\N
	so I could case all these bigrich pricks that come in.

	显然汤米对你颇有好感\N
	It's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you.
	知道你痛苦  自然想让你高兴\N
	He hears your tale of woe and naturally wants to cheer you up.
	他还小  脑筋不太灵光\N
	He's young, not terribly bright.
	根本不明会害苦了你\N
	It's not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he put you in.
	他说的是实情\N
	Sir, he's telling the truth.
	就算真有厄摩这人\N
	Let's say for the moment this Blatch does exist.
	难道他会跪地哭诉  "是我杀的  我忏悔"\N
	You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess.
	"顺便再给我加个无期徒刑吧"\N
	By the way, add a life term to my sentence."
	这无所谓 只要有汤米的证词 我就可以要求重审\N
	With Tommy's testimony,I can get a new trial.
	但你得找到厄摩\N
	That's assuming Blatch is still there.
	他可能早就出狱了\N
	Chances are, he'd be released by now.
	但能查到住址和亲友  这是机会呀\N
	They'd have his last known address.It's a chance, isn't it?

	我若出狱  绝不提你的事\N
	If I got out, I'd never mentionwhat happens here.
	我洗钱  与你同罪\N
	I'd be as indictable as you for laundering that money.
	不许你说钱这个字  兔崽子\N

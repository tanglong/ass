	Yeah. I read a lot of history books.
	页数多  价格低  故事都是打打杀杀\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}
	They're long and cheap and usually about men killing each other.
	1200页十美元不到  怎么不心动\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}
	Like 1,200 pages for $9.99. You can't beat that.
	-拿破仑啊  -是的  我很喜欢他\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}
	- But Napoleon? - Yeah. He's one of my favorites.
	-你知道什么救了拿破仑一命吗  -不\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}
	- You know what saved Napoleon's life? - No.
	-他的自负  -自负\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}
	- His ego. - Ego?
	在他经历滑铁卢的惨败之后\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}
	After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
	拿破仑把自己禁闭在圣赫勒拿岛\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}
	Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
	接下来发生什么  没人知道\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}
	No one knows exactly what happens next.
	但我喜欢的版本是这样的\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}
	But the version I like goes like this.
	他意志消沉  决定结束自己的生命\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}
	He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
	拿破仑相信自己天赋秉异\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}
	But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength
	所以  他服用了比常人多六倍的毒药\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}
	that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
	把他的胃撑坏了  结果吐了\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}
	His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it,
	所以没死\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}
	and he doesn't die.
	瞧  自负救了他一命\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}
	See? Ego. Saved his life.
	也许他需要一副眼镜\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}
	Maybe he need glasses.
	-眼镜  -用来读瓶子上的字\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}
	- Glasses? - Yes. To read words on bottle.
	是毒药\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}
	Poison.
	你说得还真有点道理\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}
	You know it's funny you should say that.
	传言拿破仑是个远视眼\N{\fe238}{\fn方正大黑简体}{\fs14}

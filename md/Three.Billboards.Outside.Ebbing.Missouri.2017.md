	倒数三  二  一\N
	In three, two, one.
	米尔德里德·海斯  你为何竖起这些广告牌\N
	So, Mildred Hayes, why did you put up these billboards?
	我的女儿  安吉拉\N
	My daughter, Angela,
	在七个月前被绑架并遭到奸杀\N
	...was abducted, raped and murdered seven months ago...
	就在这条路上\N
	...along this selfsame stretch of road.
	你在看什么  妈妈  破新闻吗\N
	What you watching, Momma? Stupid news?
	在我看来  本地警察\N
	It seems to me the local police department...
	整天忙着到处拷打黑人\N
	...is too busy going around torturing black folks...
	完全没有心思去侦破真正的罪案\N
	...to be bothered doing anything about solving actual crime.
	我想着这些广告牌也许能让他们集中精力\N
	I thought these billboards might concentrate their minds some.
	操\N
	Fuck.
	老实说  我不知道警察都在干什么\N
	I don't know what the police are doing, to be honest with you.
	我只知道我女儿烧焦的尸体\N
	I do know that my, daughter's burnt body is,
	
	依然无人被捕
	被埋在六尺之下\N
	lying six feet underground.
	而警察们每天只是吃甜甜圈\N
	All they're doing is eating Krispy Kremes...
	和抓在停车场溜冰的小屁孩\N
	...and busting eight-year-olds for skating around parking lots.
	那威洛比局长\N
	And Chief Willoughby,
	为何要专门提到他\N
	...why single him out?
	他是警察的头儿  不是吗\N
	He's the head of them, ain't he?
	必须有人来承担责任\N
	The buck's gotta stop somewhere.
	所以该由威洛比负责吗\N
	And the buck stops at Willoughby?
	没错  该由威洛比负责\N
	Yeah, the buck stops at Willoughby.
	绝对是这样\N
	Dead right it does.
	你还好吧\N
	You all right there, fella?
	看来我们有一场硬仗要打\N
	Looks like we got a war on our hands.
	我们能谈谈吗\N
	Can we talk?
	只要能抓住凶手  什么我都愿意做  海斯夫人\N
	I'd do anything to catch the guy who did it, Mrs. Hayes.
	但犯人DNA与有案底的犯人都不匹配\N
	But when the DNA, don't match no one who's ever been arrested,
	与全国范围内的犯罪记录也不匹配\N
	...and when the DNA, don't match any other crime nationwide,
	在她离开你家\N
	...and when, there wasn't a single eyewitness...
	到我们发现她这段时间内  又没有目击证人\N
	from the time she'd left your house,to the time we found her, well...
	眼下我们能做的实在有限\N
	...right now there ain't too much more we can do.
	你们可以抽取镇上所有\N
	Could pull blood from every man and boy in this town...
	八岁以上男性的血样\N
	...over the age of eight.
	民权法不允许这么做  海斯夫人\N
	There's civil rights laws prevents that, Mrs. Hayes.
	再说如果凶手只是路过小镇呢\N
	And what if he was just passing through town?
	那就抽取全国所有男性的血样\N
	Pull blood from every man in the country, then.
	那要是他只是路过这个国家呢\N
	Then what if he was just passing through the country?
	换做我的话  我会建立一个资料库\N
	If it was me, I'd start up a database.
	每个男婴儿出生  都要留下记录\N
	Every male baby what's born, stick them on it,
	等他犯罪后\N
	...and as soon as he done something wrong,
	就交叉对比\N
	...cross-reference it,
	百分百确认匹配后\N
	...make 100% certain it was a correct match,
	就杀了他\N
	...then kill him.
	好吧  这个\N
	Yeah, well, there's...
	民权法也是坚决禁止的\N
	...definitely civil rights laws prevents that.
	我已经竭尽所能追查凶手了\N
	I'm doing everything I can to track him down.
	我觉得那些广告牌不太公平\N
	I don't think those, billboards is very fair.
	就在你来这里\N
	The time it took you
	找我抱怨这会儿  威洛比\N
	to get out here whining like a bitch, Willoughby,
	也许就有\N
	...some other poor girl's
	其他可怜的女孩正被屠杀\N
	probably out there being butchered right now.
	你可真能分得清轻重缓急啊\N
	But I'm glad you got your priorities straight,
	了不起\N
	I'll say that for you.
	还有一件事  米尔德里德\N
	There's something else, Mildred.
	我得了癌症\N
	I got cancer.
	-我快死了  -我知道\N
	- I'm dying. - I know it.
	我知道  镇上大部分人都知道\N
	I know it. Most everybody in town knows it.
	那你还竖那些广告牌\N
	And you still put up, those billboards?
	你死了之后  广告牌就没那么有效果了  对吧\N
	Well, they wouldn't be as effective after you croak. Right?
	瞧啊\N
	Well, looky looky.
	这不正是\N
	If it ain't the instigator
	整件破事的煽动者吗\N
	of this whole goddamn affair in the first place.
	我才没煽动什么  迪克逊\N
	I didn't instigate shit, Dixon.
	跟镇上的小矮子打桌球\N
	Playing pool against the town midget.
	他说得对  瑞德\N
	He's right, Red,
	你在跟镇上的小矮子打桌球\N
	...you are playing pool against the town midget.
	是啊  他是警察  观察力很敏锐的\N
	You know, he's a cop. You know, he's observant.
	我一向都不喜欢你  瑞德\N
	I always disliked you, Red,
	打从你还是个挂着鼻涕的小屁孩开始\N
	...ever since you was a snotty little child.
	你现在仍然像个挂着鼻涕的小屁孩\N
	You still look like a snotty little child.
	真可惜  我一直觉得你很棒\N
	That's unfortunate. I always thought you was great.
	连你的名字  瑞德·韦尔比\N
	Even your name, Red Welby.
	连你的名字我都不喜欢\N
	Even your name I disliked.
	好吧\N
	Well...okay.
	听起来就像你是共党似的\N
	Like you was some kind of goddamn communist or something...
	-还很自豪  -不  是因为我有一头红发\N
	- ...and proud of it. - No, it's 'cause I got red hair.
	你知道他们在古巴如何对待基佬吗  韦尔比\N
	You know what they do to faggots down in Cuba, Welby?
	思维真够跳跃的\N
	Wow, that's left field.
	古巴人到底如何对待基佬呢  迪克逊\N
	No, what do they do to faggots down in Cuba, Dixon?
	杀了他们\N
	They kill 'em.
	你也许会感到意外  但我反对这种做法\N
	Which, it might surprise you to learn, I'm against.
	我不确定在古巴基佬是否真的会被杀死  迪克逊\N
	I'm not sure if they do kill faggots down in Cuba, Dixon.
	我知道就同性恋来说\N
	I know Cuba's human rights record's pretty deplorable...
	古巴的人权记录很悲惨\N
	...when it comes to homosexuality,
	但严重到杀人\N
	...but killing 'em?
	你确定你想的不是怀俄明州吗\N
	Are you sure you ain't thinking of Wyoming?
	你总是喜欢抖机灵\N
	Always with the smart-ass. Jesus.
	球打得不错  对吧\N
	He's quite good, isn't he?
	威洛比是个好人  看着我  你看着我\N
	Hey, Willoughby's a good man. Hey, look at me. Hey, look at me.
	我好声好气地跟你说话\N
	I'm talking nice to you now, aren't I?
	好声好气的\N
	I'm talking nice to you.
	威洛比是个好人  瑞德\N
	Willoughby's a good man, Red.
	不该让他为这种事烦心\N
	Shouldn't have this be the only thing he thinks about,
	他只剩下几个月了\N
	...last months left to him.
	只剩什么几个月\N
	Last months what?
	你...\N
	Oh, you...
	你不知道吗\N
	...you didn't know?
	他得了胰腺癌\N
	Yeah, pancre... pancreatic.
	下一个到我  你们俩娘们别逼逼了\N
	I'm up next. You old ladies quit yakking.
	-真没礼貌  -米尔德里德\N
	- Rude. - Hey, Mildred.
	我前几天在电视上看到你了\N
	I saw you on TV the other day.
	-是吗  -嗯  你看起来不错\N
	- Oh, yeah? - Yeah, you looked good.
	我意思是  你表现得很好\N
	I mean, you know, you came across really good...
	你要说的那些话\N
	...in the things that you were saying.
	我觉得你表现得不好\N
	I didn't think you came across real good.
	我觉得你听起来...  你看上去很蠢\N
	I think you sounded... you came across as a stupid-ass.
	这个点儿你不是该回家找你妈了吗  迪克逊\N
	Ain't it about time you got home to your momma, Dixon?
	不  这个点儿我还不用回家找我妈  妈妈\N
	No, it ain't time I go home to my mama... momma.
	我跟她说了我要出来  十二点才回去\N
	I told her I was gonna be out, till 12:00, actually.
	天呐\N
	Jesus.
	剩下你我对阵了  米尔德里德  \N
	That's me versus you, Mildred.
	罗比  那个小矮子好像对我有意思\N
	Hey, Robbie. I think that midget wants to get in my pants.
	蒙哥马利神父\N
	Father Montgomery.
	米尔德里德  很抱歉\N
	Mildred. I'm... I'm sorry
	我这么晚还来打扰  但是\N
	to be calling on you so late, but, uh...
	我得说  罗比把我招待得很好\N
	...I must say, Robbie has been the, consummate host.
	虽然他刚跟我说  \N
	Despite his having had, as he was just telling me,
	今天在学校挺难熬的\N
	...somewhat of a tricky day at school.
	不  只是球队有些人找我麻烦\N
	Oh, no. Just some of the guys on the team was giving me crap.
	找什么麻烦\N
	Crap about what?
	因为那些广告牌  米尔德里德\N
	About the billboards, Mildred.
	我来也是为了跟你谈谈这事\N
	Which is what I've come to have a word with you about.
	说吧\N
	Oh. Proceed.
	我知道过去一年对你来说\N
	I know how hard, it's been for you, Mildred,
	很艰难  我们都清楚\N
	...this past year. We all do.
	如果日后你有任何需要\N
	And if there is ever anything, that you need,
	我们都会陪在你身边  随时随地\N
	...we will be there for you. Always.
	但镇上的人也很清楚\N
	But the town also knows...
	威廉·威洛比的人品\N
	...what kind of a man, William Willoughby is.
	全镇都极力反对你的广告牌\N
	And the town is dead set against these billboards of yours.
	你做民意调查了吗  神父\N
	Took a poll, did you, Father?
	米尔德里德  如果你仍然来教堂\N
	You know, Mildred, if you hadn't stopped coming to church,
	你就会更清楚\N
	...you'd have a little bit more understanding...
	人们内心的想法\N
	...of the depth of people's feelings.
	周日有十几个人来找过我\N
	I had more than a dozen people come up to me on Sunday.
	所以是的  我做过民意调查\N
	So, yes, I took a poll.
	安吉拉的事  大家都与你同在\N
	Everybody is with you, about Angela.
	但广告牌的事没人支持你\N
	Nobody is with you about this.
	你知道我今天在想什么吗\N
	You know what I was thinking about today?
	我想到了那两支\N
	I was thinking about those street gangs...
	在洛杉矶的街头帮派\N
	...they have down in Los Angeles,
	瘸帮和血帮\N
	...those Crips and those Bloods.
	我还想到了在八十年代\N
	And I was thinking about that bunch of new laws...
	政府颁布的一系列新法\N
	...they came up with in the 1980s,
	应该是为了打击那些街头帮派\N
	I think it was, ...to combat those street gangs,
	这些瘸帮和血帮的混混\N
	those Crips and those Bloods.
	如果我没记错的话\N
	And, if I remember rightly,
	那一系列新法的重点就是\N
	the gist of what those new laws were saying was,
	如果你加入了其中一支帮派  和他们鬼混\N
	...if you join one of these gangs, and you're running with them,
	某晚你走在街上  你不知道在什么时候\N
	...and down the block one night, unbeknownst to you,
	你的瘸帮或是血帮同伙\N
	...one of your fellow Crips, or your fellow Bloods,
	在附近开枪或者拿刀捅人\N
	...shoot up a place, or stab a guy...
	就算你可能对此毫不知情\N
	...well then, even though you may not know nothing about it...
	就算你可能\N
	...and even though you may
	只是站在了街角处\N
	have just been standing on a street corner,
	做着自己的事情\N
	...minding your own business...
	新法还是会判你有罪\N
	What these new laws said was, you're still culpable.
	你会因为加入了瘸帮或血帮\N
	You're still culpable by the very act of having joined...
	这个行为就被判有罪\N
	...those Crips and those Bloods in the first place.
	神父  这不禁让我想到\N
	Which got me thinking, Father...
	这种情况\N
	...that whole type of situation...
	不就和你们教会很像吗\N
	...is kinda like you church boys, ain't it?
	你们有自己的旗子  活动场所\N
	You got your colors, you got your clubhouse.
	怎么说呢  你们也是个帮派\N
	You're, for want of a better word, a gang.
	如果你在楼上边抽烟边读《圣经》\N
	And if you were upstairs smoking a pipe and reading your Bible...
	与此同时  你的帮派成员\N
	...while one of your fellow gang members...
	正在楼下猥亵祭坛男童  那...\N
	...is downstairs fucking an altar boy, well...
	神父  你就像那些瘸帮和血帮成员一样\N
	Father, just like those Crips, and just like those Bloods,
	你也有罪\N
	...you're culpable...
	因为你加入了这个帮派\N
	...'cause you joined the gang, man.
	我不管你有没有做过\N
	I don't care if you never did shit,
	看见过  或是听说过这种破事\N
	...you never saw shit, you never heard shit.
	你加入了帮派  你就有罪\N
	You join the gang, you're culpable.
	当一个人因为猥亵祭坛男童\N
	And when a person is culpable, to altar-boy-fucking,
	或是猥亵任何男童被判有罪时\N
	...or any kinda boy-fucking,
	我知道你们这些人不怎么挑\N
	...'cause I know you guys didn't really narrow that down...
	这种人没资格进入我家\N
	...then you kinda forfeit the right to come into my house...
	干涉我和我的生活\N
	...and say anything about me, or my life,
	对我的女儿和我的广告牌指手画脚\N
	...or my daughter, or my billboards.
	您先把茶喝完吧  神父\N
	So why don't you just finish up your tea there, Father,
	然后滚出我的厨房\N
	...and get the fuck outta my kitchen.
	还是谢谢您的拜访  神父\N
	But thanks for coming up anyway, Father.
	感觉怎么样  比尔\N
	How you been feeling, Bill?
	感觉像是我的一个主要器官得了癌症\N
	Ah, like I got cancer in a major organ.
	我只想告诉你  关于米尔德里德·海斯的事\N
	Well, I just want you to know we're all on your side...
	我们都站在你这边\N
	...about this Mildred Hayes thing.
	如果我再他妈听到有人跟我说这句话\N
	If I have to hear that one more fucking time...
	我受够了  我不想浪费生命等待\N
	I'm done with this shit. I can't waste my life waiting.
	别他妈看漫画书了\N
	Stop reading fucking comic books...
	把海斯的案卷拿给我\N
	...and get me the file on the Hayes case.
	是安吉拉的还是米尔德里德的\N
	Angela Hayes case or the Mildred Hayes case?
	根本没有米尔德里德·海斯的案卷\N
	There is no Mildred Hayes case.
	我们收到了两起\N
	We've had two official complaints...
	对广告牌的正式投诉  所以...\N
	...about those billboards, so, actually...
	谁投诉的\N
	From who?
	一只眼睛很可笑的女人\N
	There's a lady with a funny eye...
	还有个胖牙医\N
	...and a fat dentist.
	把安吉拉·海斯的案卷给我\N
	Get me the file on the Angela Hayes case.
	"一只眼睛很可笑的女人"\N
	"A lady with a funny fucking eye"?
	老天\N
	Jesus Christ.
	又喝到很晚\N
	Late night?
	没\N
	No.
	别去找韦尔比的麻烦了行吗\N
	Lay off that Welby guy, will you?
	我要是不听呢\N
	Or you'll do what?
	把你妈妈的牙齿都踢碎\N
	Kick your momma's fucking teeth in.
	你不会这么做的\N
	No, you won't.
	谁告诉你我找他麻烦了  那个小矮子吗\N
	Who told you I was laying on him anyway? The midget?
	你他妈在说些什么啊\N
	What the fuck are you talking about?
	我还想在这里专心办案\N
	And I'm trying to fucking concentrate.
	去他的小矮子\N
	Fucking midgets!
	
	怎么搞的  威洛比局长
	你这是在找什么啊\N
	What you looking for anyway?
	这里什么都没有啊\N
	There's nothing to look for.
	我不知道是怎么回事\N
	I don't know what it is.
	感觉这个牙松动了\N
	It feels like it's kinda waggling.
	如果松动的话  就得拔出来\N
	Well, if it's waggling, it's gonna have to come out.
	你难道不要先看看吗\N
	Ain't you gonna take a look at it first?
	一定要拔掉\N
	It's gonna have to come out.
	能给我打点麻药吗  医生\N
	Can I get a little Novocaine there, Doc?
	等个几分钟\N
	Give it a couple of minutes.
	我只是想说这镇上很多人\N
	I just wanted to say there's a lot of good friends...
	都是比尔·威洛比的好朋友  海斯夫人\N
	...of Bill Willoughby in this town, Miss Hayes.
	不要  住手  快住手\N
	No! Ow! Stop! No!
	该死的\N
	God damn it!
	那你去告诉比尔·威洛比的那些好朋友\N
	Then why don't you tell those good friends of Bill Willoughby...
	要他做好自己那该死的工作  死胖子\N
	...to tell him to go do his fucking job, fat boy.
	你好啊  米尔德里德\N
	Hey there, Mildred.
	今天去看牙医的人\N
	You didn't happen to pay a, visit...
	不会碰巧是你吧\N
	...to the dentist today, did you?
	不是\N
	No.
	我说了  不是\N
	I said, "No."
	那不是你在肥仔杰弗里的\N
	Oh, so it wasn't you who drilled a little hole...
	肥大指甲盖上钻了个小洞咯\N
	...in one of big fat Geoffrey's big fat thumbnails, no?
	当然不是\N
	Of course not.
	我说了  当然不是\N
	I said, "Of course not."
	你在牙医手上钻了个洞\N
	You drilled a hole in the dentist?
	我没有  丹妮丝\N
	Denise, no, I didn't.
	我自己还是觉得挺好笑的  不过\N
	I thought it was kinda funny myself, but...
	他想告你\N
	...he wants to press charges,
	恐怕我们得把你带进局子里了\N
	...so we're gonna have to bring you in, I'm afraid.
	近来黑鬼折磨事业进展如何  迪克逊\N
	So how's it all going in the nigger-torturing business, Dixon?
	我们现在都说折磨有色人种\N
	It's persons-of-color-torturing business, these days.
	你要真想知道的话\N
	If you wanna know...
	我谁都没折磨\N
	...I didn't torture nobody.
	你在电视上说那些话是有什么毛病啊\N
	What's the matter with you, saying that goddamn, stuff on TV?
	我妈妈经常看那个台的\N
	My momma watches that station.
	你妈妈不知道你折磨人的事吗\N
	Your momma doesn't know about the torturing?
	她一点都不知道\N
	No, she doesn't know anything about it.
	她反对那样做\N
	She's against that kinda thing.
	谁反对什么\N
	Who's against what?
	我妈妈...反对折磨有色人种\N
	My mama... momma is against persons-of-color-torturing.
	她说的是"折磨黑鬼"\N
	She said, "Nigger-torturing."
	我说"现在不能再说折磨黑鬼了"\N
	I said, "You can't say nigger-torturing' no more."
	"你得说折磨有色人种"\N
	"You gotta say persons-of-color-torturing."
	我说得对吗  局长\N
	Isn't that right, Chief?
	说得对吗\N
	Ain't that right?
	接下来让我一个人来处理\N
	I think I'll be able to, take care of Mrs. Hayes...
	海斯夫人的事就行  杰森\N
	...on my own from here on, Jason.
	好的局长  我就在外面\N
	Sure, Chief. I'll be right outside.
	别那副表情看我\N
	Don't give me that look.
	如果你想除掉每个有种族歧视倾向的警察\N
	If you got rid of every cop with vaguely racist leanings,
	那局里只会留下三个警察\N
	...you'd have... three cops left,
	而这三个还都讨厌基佬\N
	...and all of them are gonna hate the fags.
	到时候你又该怎么办呢\N
	So what are you gonna do, you know?
	我想问你件事  米尔德里德\N
	I wanna know something, Mildred.
	你为什么要在那可怜的\N
	Why'd you drill a hole...
	肥仔杰弗里的指甲盖上钻洞呢\N
	...through poor fat Geoffrey's thumbnail?
	没那回事\N
	That did not happen.
	他手滑了一下\N
	His hand slipped.
	不小心在自己手上钻了个洞\N
	He drilled a hole through his own self.
	他说是我干的吗\N
	Did he say I did it?
	看来我们俩的口供不一致啊\N
	I guess it's his word against mine, then, huh?
	有点像你听说的那些强奸案\N
	Kinda like in all those rape cases you hear about.
	只不过这次女人没有输\N
	Except, this time, the chick ain't losing.
	这其实跟输赢无关吧  是吗  米尔德里德\N
	It ain't really about winning or losing, though, is it, Mildred?
	你觉得我会关心你们两个谁输谁赢吗\N
	You think I, care about who wins or loses between the two of youse?
	你觉得我会关心牙医吗\N
	You think I care about dentists?
	我根本就不关心什么牙医\N
	I don't care about dentists.
	没人会关心牙医\N
	Nobody cares about dentists.
	我关心的  或者说\N
	What I do care about, or what I'm...
	我感兴趣的是\N
	...interested in...
	让你在法庭里脱不了身\N
	...is tying you up in court so long...
	占用掉你你在礼品店工作的大半时间\N
	...that your hours at the gift shop be so shot to shit...
	导致你身上没有一分钱\N
	...that you ain't gonna have a penny...
	来付广告牌下个月的租金\N
	...to pay for another month's billboards.
	-我存了些...  -我感兴趣的是这个\N
	- I got some dough put... - That's what I'm interested in.
	我存了些钱\N
	I got some dough put away.
	但我听说的是\N
	But what I heard,
	你不得不卖掉你前夫的牵引拖车\N
	was you had to sell off your ex-husband's tractor-trailer...
	才勉强租了这个月的广告牌  对吗\N
	...to even pay for this month's billboards, that right?
	对了  老查理最近怎么样\N
	How is old Charlie, by the way?
	还是在和那个\N
	He still shacked up with
	在动物园实习的小美女同居吗\N
	that pretty little intern works down at the zoo?
	是和闻起来一股屎味的妞同居\N
	He's still shacked up with some chick smells of shit.
	我不知道是不是她在动物园工作的原因\N
	I don't know if the zoo's got anything to do with it.
	希望是如此\N

	这也好  虽然一个人竭力避免\N
	It's good too, that as much as a person might have tried...

	但是你上次付的第一笔钱其实是押金\N
	the first payment you paid was actually a deposit.
	是吧  就像我们说好的那样\N

	你现在还没有\N
	Not yet you ain't.
	我们不是敌人\N
	We ain't all the enemy, you know.

	尽管这些被烧毁的广告牌\N
	And as sad as the spectacle...
	显露出一副悲凉的景象\N
	...of these burned out billboards might be,
	考虑到威洛比局长的死\N

	...lit outside of town last night.
	几场火  是吗\N
	Bunch of fires, huh?
	就是那几块广告牌\N
	Out at those billboards.
	我当警察的时候\N
	Yeah, well, back when I was a cop,
	我倒是会关心是谁放的火\N
	I would have been interested in who set those fires,
	因为  严格来说  那是纵火罪\N
	because, technically, that's arson.
	但是  我已经不为那帮人卖命了\N
	But, as I'm no longer employed by those people,
	我就根本不在乎了  不是吗\N

	我没读  迪克逊  又不是我的信\N

	Oh, well, listen, I'll... I'll come right down.
	我十五分钟后到\N
	Um, I'll be there in like 15 minutes.
	我觉得这样可能不太好\N
	Yeah, I d... I don't think that'd be such a great idea,
	尤其是目前的情况  杰森\N
	things as they stand, Jason.
	你手头还有\N
	You... you still got your keys
	局里的钥匙  是吧\N
	to the station house, though, right?
	对\N
	Yeah.
	要不这样  你等大家下班回家之后\N
	Well, why don't you, come and pick it up
	再过来取信\N
	after everyone's gone home?
	我把它放你桌子上\N
	I can leave it on your desk for you.
	好的\N
	Oh, okay.
	还有  \N
	Actually, yeah, then
	取完信  你可以\N
	when you're done, you can... you can
	把钥匙留下\N
	just leave the keys
	省得我们以后过去取了\N
	you know, save us picking 'em up later.
	好的\N
	All right.
	
	杰森·迪克逊警官
	杰森  我是威洛比\N
	Jason, Willoughby here.
	很抱歉  我已经死了\N
	I'm dead now. Sorry about that.
	我有些事情想告诉你\N
	There's something I wanted to say to you
	一些在我生前没能说出口的话\N
	that I never really said when I was alive.
	我认为你具备成为一名\N
	I think you've got the makings
	优秀警察的素质  杰森\N
	of being a really good cop, Jason.
	你知道原因吗\N
	And you know why?
	因为内心深处  你是一个正派的人\N
	Because deep down, you're a decent man.
	我知道你觉得我不是这么想的\N
	I know you don't think I think that,
	但却是真的  傻瓜\N
	but I do, dipshit.
	不过  我确实认为你太暴躁了\N
	I do think you're too angry, though.
	我知道这都是因为你爸去世\N
	And I know it's all since your dad died
	你得照顾老妈  负责一切\N
	and you had to go look after your mom and all.
	但是如果你无法克制怒火  那么我认为\N
	But as long as you hold on to so much hate, then I don't think...
	你永远都不会成为\N
	you're ever gonna become
	那个我知道你想成为的角色\N
	what I know you wanna become.
	警探\N
	A detective.
	你知道要成为警探\N
	Because you know what you need
	你还需要什么吗\N
	to become a detective?
	我还知道当我这么说的时候你会退缩\N
	And I know you're gonna wince when I say this...
	但要成为警探  你所需要的  就是爱\N
	But what you need, to become a detective... is love.
	接招吧\N
	Fuck 'em.
	因为爱生静\N
	Because through love comes calm,
	静生思\N
	and through calm, comes thought.
	有时候  侦察是需要思考的  杰森\N
	And you need thought to detect stuff sometimes, Jason.
	你需要的就这些\N
	It's kinda all you need.
	你不需要枪\N
	You don't even need a gun.
	你也绝对不需要恨意\N
	And you definitely don't need hate.
	恨意永远都无法解决事情\N
	Hate never solved nothing.
	但静却能  思也能\N
	But calm did. And thought did.
	试试  试着改变一下\N
	Try it. Try it just for a change.
	没有人会觉得你是同性恋的\N
	No one will think you're gay.
	如果他们这么认为  那就以恐同罪逮捕他们\N
	And if they do, arrest them for homophobia.
	那样他们就该感到意外了吧\N
	Won't they be surprised?
	祝你好运  杰森  你是个正派的人\N
	Good luck to you, Jason. You're a decent man.
	你的霉运走得够多的了\N
	And yeah, you've had a run of bad luck...
	但是会改变的  我能感觉到\N
	but things are gonna change for you. I can feel it.

	...embarrassed to be here ever since we arrived.
	不是吧\N
	Oh, for Christ sake.
	不是我逼你来的  对吧\N
	I didn't force you to come on this date, all right?
	你逼我来的\N
	You forced me.
	逼你\N
	F... forced you?
	是约你出来\N
	I asked you on a date. Wow.
	你知道吗\N
	You know...
	我是没什么魅力\N
	I know I'm not that much of a catch.
	我是个卖二手车的侏儒\N
	I know I'm a dwarf who sells used cars...
	我还酗酒  我知道\N
	...and has a drinking problem. I know that.
	那你又算什么\N
	But who the hell are you, man?
	广告牌女士  你从来都不笑\N
	You're that billboard lady who never smiles,
	从来不对别人说一句好话\N
	...never has a good word to say about anybody,
	那天晚上又是谁\N
	...and who, in the evening times,
	把警察局给烧了\N
	sets fucking fire to police stations!
	结果我才是没有魅力的那个吗\N
	And I'm the one who's not a catch?
	要知道我完全可以不去帮你扶梯子的\N
	You know, I didn't have to come and hold your ladder.
	别闹大了\N
	Now, don't make a scene.
	你真的跟他说  "怨恨只会招致更多怨恨"\N
	Did you really tell him, "Anger begets greater anger"?
	是的是的\N
	Oh! Yes! I did.
	但不是我自己想的\N
	I didn't make it up myself though.
	不是我原创的\N
	I can't claim that.
	我从我看的一本书里\N
	No, I read it, on a bookmark...
	夹的书签上看到的\N
	...which was in a book I was reading...
	关于小儿麻痹症的书\N
	...about polio.
	还是马球  是哪个来着  就是讲马的\N
	Polo. No. Which is the one, with the horses?
	小儿麻痹症还是马球\N
	Polio or polo?
	-马球  -马球\N
	- Polo. - Polo.
	好好待她  查理\N
	Be nice to her, Charlie.
	听到了吗\N
	You got that?
	杰森\N
	Jason!
	-杰森  -杰森  -别看我\N
	- Jason. Jason! - Don't look at me.
	-别看我  -他们对你做了什么\N
	- Don't look at me! - What have they done to you?
	-别管我  妈妈  -你...\N
	- Leave me, Momma! - Are you...
	不  不要\N
	No. No! Oh!
	别把我...\N
	Oh, don't let me...
	
	折起来密封\N证据
	开门\N
	Open up this door!
	拜托  杰森\N
	Please, Jason.
	让我帮帮你  拜托了\N
	Let me help you. Please.
	你是我的孩子  开门啊\N
	You're my baby boy. Open this door.
	快开门\N
	Please.
	杰森  开门\N
	Jason, please.
	听话\N
	Please.
	快开开门\N
	Please open the door.
	
	爱达荷州
	开门\N
	Open up!
	杰森\N
	Jason!
	我没事  妈妈\N
	I'm all right, Momma.
	一切会好起来的\N
	It's all gonna be all right.
	我不想给你假希望  好吧\N
	I don't wanna get your hopes up, all right,
	但有个家伙  我觉得...\N
	but there is a guy, and I think...
	他可能是凶手  我有他的DNA\N
	he might be the guy. I got his DNA.
	很多很多的DNA\N
	Got a lot of it, actually.
	我们说话这会  他们已经在检测了\N
	They're making the checks, as we speak.
	他在牢里吗\N
	He's in jail?
	不在  但是应该不难找\N
	No, but he ain't gonna be hard to find.
	你为什么觉得他是凶手\N
	Why do you think he's the guy?
	我听到他在谈论...\N
	I heard him talking about...
	去年年中对一个女孩做过的事\N
	something he did to a girl the middle of last year.
	我没听全  但...\N
	I couldn't hear all of it, but...
	但听着像安吉拉的遭遇\N
	It sounded a lot like what happened to Angela.
	然后他把我狠揍了一顿\N
	And then he beat the crap out of me.
	正因如此...\N
	But because of that...
	我拿到了很多他的基因\N
	I got a bunch of his DNA.
	所以  我想...\N
	So, I wanted to...
	尽快把这个消息告诉你\N
	let you know sooner rather than later.
	我不想让你放弃希望  好吗\N
	I didn't want you to give up hope, you know?
	我在坚持\N
	I've been trying not to.
	那...\N
	Well...
	你只能尽力而为\N
	all you can do is try.
	就像我妈说的...\N
	As my momma says...
	虽然不是说抱有希望  而是\N
	not so much about hope as about...
	我上学时候英语不好\N
	well, I didn't used to be very good at English at school.
	所以只能是"你只能尽力而为..."\N
	So it was more "All you can do is try..."
	"别把英语考得太差"\N
	"to not be so crap at English."
	因为如果你想当警察  必须学好英语\N
	Because you need English, really, if you wanna be a cop.
	其实做什么都需要英语好\N
	If you wanna be anything, really.
	除非你住在墨西哥之类的地方\N
	Unless you live in Mexico or something.
	谁想去那种地方\N
	Who wants that?
	迪克逊\N
	Hey, Dixon?
	谢谢你\N
	Thank you.
	你做得很棒  杰森\N
	You did good, Jason.
	干得真漂亮\N
	You did real good.
	但是他不是凶手\N
	But he wasn't the guy.
	什么\N
	What?
	没找到匹配的DNA\N
	There was no match to the DNA.
	同类型案件中没有找到匹配对象\N
	No matches to any other crimes of this nature.
	其实和所有案件都不匹配\N
	To any crimes at all, in fact.
	他没有案底\N
	And his record is clean.
	或许他只是在吹牛\N
	Maybe he was just bragging.
	-他不是在吹牛  -有这个可能\N
	- He wasn't just bragging. - Well, that's as may be.
	但安吉拉死时...\N
	But at the time of Angela's death...
	他都不在国内\N
	he wasn't even in the country.
	他在哪儿\N
	Where was he?
	我看了他的出入境记录\N
	Well, I've seen his records of entry and exit to the States,
	也和他的指挥官谈过了\N
	and I've spoken to his commanding officer.
	他不在国内  迪克逊  他不是我们要找的人\N
	He wasn't in the country, Dixon. He ain't our guy.
	不  他...\N
	Uh, no, he...
	他...他就算不是我们要找的人\N
	He... he might not be our guy,
	但他仍然做了其他混账事\N
	but he still done something shitty.
	这我确定\N
	I know he did.
	但不是在密苏里州干的\N
	Not in Missouri he didn't.
	那是在哪儿\N
	Where was he?
	这都是机密\N
	That's classified information.
	别这样  伙计\N
	Oh, come on, man.
	如果这家伙有指挥官\N
	If the guy has a commanding officer,
	如果这家伙九个月前回的国\N
	and if the guy got back to the country nine months ago,
	如果他去的国家还需要保密\N
	and if the country where he was is classified,
	你觉得他会去哪个国家\N
	which country do you think he was in?
	你知道...\N
	Hey, you know...
	我给你个提示\N
	I'll give you a clue.
	那里是沙漠区\N
	It was sandy.
	这线索并没什么用啊\N
	That doesn't really narrow it down.
	你需要知道的是...\N
	All you need to know is that...
	安吉拉·海斯的事不是他干的\N
	he didn't do nothing to Angela Hayes,
	所以...我们还得继续查\N
	so... we're gonna keep looking.
	好吗\N
	All right?
	我找到警徽了\N
	I found my badge after all.
	
	怎么搞的  威洛比局长
	你好\N
	Hello?
	我是迪克逊\N
	It's Dixon.
	说吧\N
	Tell me.
	他不是凶手\N
	He wasn't the guy.
	米尔德里德\N
	Mildred?
	你确定吗\N
	Are you sure?
	事件发生时他都不在国内\N
	He... he wasn't even in the country when it happened.
	所以  不管他做了什么...\N
	So, whatever he did...
	都不是在这里做的\N
	he didn't do it round here.
	抱歉给了你假希望\N
	I'm sorry I got your hopes up.
	没事的  没事\N
	Well, that's all right. That's all right.
	至少我过了心怀希望的一天\N
	At least I had a day of hoping,
	是我这段时间来最好的一天\N
	and that's more than I've had for a while.
	我得挂了\N
	I gotta go.
	我有...\N
	There was, uh...
	我在想一件事\N
	There was one thing I was thinking.
	什么事\N
	What's that?
	我知道他没强奸你女儿\N
	I know he ain't your rapist.
	但我确定  他仍然是个强奸犯\N
	He is a rapist, though. I'm sure of that.
	你想对我说什么\N
	What are you saying to me?
	我知道他的车牌号\N
	Got his license plate.
	我知道他住哪儿\N
	I know where he lives.
	他住哪儿\N
	Where's he live?
	他住在爱达荷州\N
	He lives in Idaho.
	有点意思\N
	That's funny.
	我早晨要开车去爱达荷州\N
	I'm driving to Idaho in the morning.
	需要个伴吗\N
	Want some company?
	好的\N
	Sure.

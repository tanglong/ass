	那堵  关于距离 关于空间  关于暧昧\N
	the wall of distance, of space, of casual-
	那堵墙正在慢慢倒塌\N
	that wall was slowly coming down.
	是 Tom  进入了她的世界\N
	For here was Tom, in her world,
	一个很少人可以进入的世界\N
	a place few had been invited to see with their own eyes.
	Summer 希望他进来\N
	And here was Summer, wanting him there.
	他 而不是别人\N
	Him, no one else.
	- 你见过龙卷风吗   - 没有\N

	我曾经做过一个梦 我在飞\N
	You know, I dream sometimes about flying.
	开始的时候我只是跑   那么快\N
	It starts out like I'm running really, really fast.
	就像 超人\N
	I'm, like, superhuman.
	渐渐地面变成了陡峭的岩石\N
	And the terrain starts to get really rocky and steep.
	我跑的太快了  离开了地面\N
	And then I'm running so fast that my feet aren't even touching the ground.
	我飞起来了  很奇妙  奇妙且真实\N
	And I'm floating, and it's like this amazing, amazing realness.
	感觉很自由  很安全\N
	I'm free. I'm safe.
	然后我明白了\N
	Then I realize,
	我是一个人\N
	l'm completely alone.
	然后就醒了\N
	And then I wake up.
	他听着  Tom 开始发觉\N
	As he listened, Tom began to realize...
	这并不是随便讲给人听的故事\N
	that these weren't stories routinely told.
	而是有资格的人才能听的\N
	These were stories one had to earn.
	他感觉到那堵墙正在消失\N
	He could feel the wall coming down.
	他很好奇有没有其他人也曾到这里\N
	He wondered if anyone else had made it this far.
	而后面的话  改变了一切\N
	Which is why the next six words changed everything.
	我以前从没跟别人讲过这些\N
	I've never told anybody that before.

	What, like, are we going steady? Come on, guys.
	我们.. 我们是成年人   你知道我们在想什么\N
	You know, we're- we're adults. We know how we feel.
	我们不用贴那些标签\N
	We don't need to put labels on it.
	就像 "男朋友"  "女朋友"\N
	I mean, "boyfriend," "girlfriend."
	那些东西都... 太幼稚了\N
	All that stuff is- It's really juvenile.
	- 听起来好像你是同性恋   - 确实\N
	You sound gay. You really do.
	好吧  首先\N
	Okay, first of all,
	你最后一个女朋友是  七年级的艾米·苏斯曼\N

	- 那我该怎么办   - 你该去问她\N
	So, what should I do? You should ask her.
	怎么了\N
	What?
	我在想  干吗要自找麻烦\N
	Well, why rock the boat, is what I'm thinking.
	一切不都很好吗\N
	I mean, things are going well.
	你想确定关系  但那可能就完蛋了\N
	You start putting labels on it, that's like the kiss of death.
	- 就像 " 我爱你 "    - 好了 我知道你说什么了\N
	It's like saying, "I love you." Yeah, I know what you mean.
	我和肖恩也是那样\N
	That's what happened between me and Sean.
	- 哪的混蛋肖恩   - 马克之前的男朋友\N
	Who the hell's Sean? My boyfriend before Mark.
	谁是... 算了\N
	Who the- Never mind.
	- 那么  你的意思是   - 我是说你确实想问她\N
	So, what you're saying- I'm saying you do want to ask her.
	很明显   你只是怕答案不是你想要的\N
	It's obvious. You're just afraid you'll get an answer you don't want,
	那会打碎几个月以来所有的幻想\N
	which will shatter all the illusions of how great these past few months have been.
	这样   如果是我\N
	Now look, if it were me,
	我会现在就弄清楚  而不是稀里糊涂地回到家\N
	I'd find out now before you show up at her place...
	发现她和挪威来的拉尔斯躺在一起\N

	Just some guy she met at the gym...
	有着布拉德·皮特俏脸和耶稣魅力的人\N
	with Brad Pitt's face and Jesus' abs.
	等等  不  我们不能这样结束\N
	Wait! No, Coach. We're not done here.
	- 雷切尔  - 这很容易 Tom\N
	Rachel! Look, it's easy, Tom.

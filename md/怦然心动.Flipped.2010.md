	我只希望朱莉 贝克能够离我远点\N
	All i ever wanted was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.
	一切开始于1957年的夏天\N
	It all began in the summer of 1957,
	一年级的暑假\N
	before the start of second grade.
	我喜欢这里\N
	I like this place.
	真美 我的房间是什么颜色的呀\N
	It's cool. Uh, what color is my room?
	一会儿你就知道咯\N
	Just you wait.
	咱们进去瞧瞧  嘿 布莱斯 过来\N
	Let's see what's inside. Hey, come on, buddy Bryce.
	咱父子俩把车上的东西搬下来吧\N
	Why don't, uh, you and I go help unload the van...
	让姑娘们进去\N
	...and the womenfolk here can get in
	收拾一下厨房\N
	the kitchen and start setting up
	好的 爸爸\N
	Okay, dad.
	对我而言 这意味着我步入了\N
	For me, it was the beginning of what would be...
	长达五年的\N
	...more than half a decade of strategic
	人际逃避和社交不适的生涯\N
	avoidance and social discomfort.
	嗨 我叫朱莉 贝克 - 喂喂喂 你干嘛呢\N
	- hi, i'm Juli Baker. - hey, hey, what are you doing?
	你们需要帮忙吗\N
	Don't you want some help?
	不必了 里面是些贵重物品\N
	No. there's some valuable things in there.
	那这个呢？ - 不用了不用了\N
	- how about this one? - no, no, no.
	你还是快些回家吧 你妈妈没准正在找你呢\N
	Why don't you run along home. your mother's probably wondering where you are.
	不会的 我妈妈知道我在哪 她没意见的\N
	Oh, no, my mom knows where i am. she said it's fine.
	我立刻意识到\N
	It didn't take long to realize
	这女孩太不识趣了\N
	this girl could not take a hint.
	我们三个人在这有点挤吧 - 我不介意呀\N
	- it's crowded in here with three people. - i don't mind.
	- 一点眼色都没有 - 我们一起搬这个吧\N
	- Of any kind. - you wanna push this one together?
	布莱斯 你是不是该去给你妈妈帮忙了\N
	Bryce, isn't it time for you to go help your mother?
	啊 没错\N
	Oh, yeah.
	我真拿她没辙\N
	I mean, nothing would stop her.
	我正想朝她发火时\N
	I was about to tell her to get lost
	奇怪的事情发生了\N
	when the weird thing happeed.
	我简直不敢相信\N
	I couldn't believe it.
	我竟然牵了这个奇女子的手\N
	There I was holding hands with this strange girl.
	你好呀\N
	Well, hello.
	- 看来你已经认识我儿子了 - 是的\N
	- i see you've met my son. - uh-huh.
	最后 我祭出了积攒七年的\N
	Finally, i did the only manly thing
	所有雄性荷尔蒙\N
	available when you are 7 years old.
	然而 我的麻烦还远未结束\N
	However, my troubles were far from over.
	当我走进叶尔森老师的教室时\N
	The minute i walked into Miss Yelson's classroom...
	布莱斯 你也在这儿啊\N
	Bryce? you're here.
	显然 学校并不能让我脱离苦海\N
	It was clear, school would not be a sanctuary.
	嘿 布莱斯 你女朋友呢\N
	Hey, Bryce, where's your girlfriend?
	我被贴上了各种标签\N
	I was branded for life.
	嘿 布莱斯 你为啥不向她求婚呢\N
	Hey, Bryce, why don't you ask her to marry you?
	布莱斯和朱莉坐上树梢\N
	Bryce and Juli sitting in a tree
	亲亲抱抱举高高\N
	K-I-S-S-I-n-G
	我搬来镇上的第一年简直就是一场灾难\N
	My first year in town was a disaster.
	瞧\N
	Look at them.
	接下来的三年也是差强人意\N
	And the next three weren't much better.
	到了六年级 我决定做些什么\N
	But finally, in the sixth grade, i took action.
	于是我想出了一个计划\N
	I hatched the plan.
	雪莉\N
	Sherry.
	雪莉 等等我\N
	Sherry, wait up.
	嗨 布莱斯\N
	Hi, Bryce. heh.
	我决定追求雪莉 斯道尔\N
	I asked out Sherry Stalls.
	我想问问你愿不愿意\N
	I was wondering if you wanted to go...
	这一招的绝妙之处在于\N
	To full appreciate the brilliance of this plan...
	朱莉简直恨死了雪莉 斯道尔\N
	...you have to understand that Juli hated Sherry Stalls...
	尽管我不知道个中缘由\N
	...though i never understood why.
	雪莉貌美心善 秀发飘飘\N
	Sherry was nice, friendly and she had a lot of hair.
	一开始我妈一直不肯让我打耳洞\N
	At first, my mother wouldn't let me
	但我一直求她\N
	get my ears pierceed but I beg...
	我原计划和雪莉吃吃饭\N
	The idea was that Sherry would eat with me...
	可能再散散步\N
	...maybe we'd walk around together,
	然后朱莉就会对我失去兴趣\N
	and hopefully Juli would lose interest.
	但我16岁之前还是不能打耳洞\N
	But i still can't get the hoops till i'm 16.
	太可惜了\N
	Oh, that's a shame.
	米兰妮也想打耳洞\N
	So melanie wanted to get her ears pierced,
	但她妈坚决不同意\N
	but of course her mother said no.
	于是她就一怒之下\N
	So she threw a fit and smashed her
	把约翰尼 马蒂斯的精选辑给砸了\N
	Johnny Mathis Greatest Hits albim
	然后她就被禁足了\N
	...and she got grounded, so now she can't
	连我的睡衣派对都来不了\N
	come to my pajamaat sleepover party.
	事情进展的不错\N
	Things were unfolding quite nicely.
	你的科学实验准备怎么做\N
	What are you doing for your science project?
	直到我所谓的挚友 加利特埃恩德\N
	That is, until my supposed best friend, Garrett Einbinder...
	打起了雪莉的主意\N
	...took an interest in Sherry himself.
	我想展示护发素\N
	I was thinking of showing how split ends
	是如何修复头发分叉的\N
	react with different being poisoned?
	这主意真棒\N
	That's fascinating.
	加利特这个重色轻友的叛徒\N
	Loyalty gave way to desire and garrett, the turncoat...
	告诉了雪莉 我接近她的目的\N
	...told Sherry what i was up to.
	混蛋\N
	Jerk.
	她很生气\N
	She didn't take it well.
	至于朱莉 她很快\N
	Word got back to Juli, and pretty soon she
	又开始视奸我\N
	started up with the the google eyes again?
	但这次她更过分了\N
	Only this time it was worse.
	她开始嗅我的味道\N
	She started sniffing me.
	没错 嗅\N
	That's right, sniffing me.
	这是在搞什么\N
	What was that all about?
	我唯一的期盼便是来年的毕业\N
	My only consolation was that next year would be different.
	等我上了初中\N
	Junior high, bigger school.
	或许我们就不会在一个班了\N
	Maybe we'd be in different classes and
	到时一切都将结束\N
	it would finally,finally be over
	见到布莱斯 洛斯基的第一眼 我便心动了\N
	The first day i met Bryce Loski, i flipped.
	他的眼眸让我深陷其中\N
	It was those eyes, something in those dazzling eyes.
	我们一起搬吧\N
	You wanna push this one together?
	当时他家刚搬到我家隔壁\N
	His family had just moved into the neighborhood...
	我过去帮他们搬东西\N
	...and i'd gone over to help them.
	我才在卡车里待了两分钟\N
	I'd been in the van all of two minutes
	他爸爸就让他去帮他妈妈\N
	when his dad sent him off to help his mther
	我看得出来他并不想去\N
	I could see he didn't wanna go.
	所以我追了上去\N
	So i chased after him to see if we could
	想问问他进屋前能不能先玩一会儿\N
	play a little before he got trapped inside
	下一刻 我便意识到他正牵着我的手\N
	The next thing i know, he's holding my hand...
	凝视着我\N
	...and looking right into my eyes.
	我的心停止了跳动\N
	My heart stopped.
	这一刻到来了吗\N
	Was this it?
	我要献出初吻了吗\N
	Would this be my first kiss?
	- 可没想到他妈妈出来了 - 你好呀\N
	- but then his mother came out. - well, hello.
	他一下子尴尬了 瞬间羞红了脸\N
	And he was so embarrassed, his cheeks turned completely red.
	那晚上 我辗转反侧\N
	I went to bed that night thinking
	不停幻想着初吻的场景\N
	of the kiss that might have been.
	我知道他对我动心了\N
	I mean, it was clear he had feelings for me,
	只是羞于启齿\N
	but he was just too shy to show them
	妈妈说过男孩子都是这样的\N
	My mother said boys were like that.
	- 于是我决定帮助他 - 布莱斯 你也在这里啊\N
	- so i decided to help him out. - Bryce? you're here.
	我会尽全力\N
	I would give him plenty of
	帮他克服羞怯\N
	opportunity to get over his shyness
	到了六年级 我学着收敛些许\N
	By the sixth grade, i'd learned to control myself.
	却没想到半路杀出个雪莉 斯道尔\N
	Then Sherry Stalls entered the picture.
	她不过是个\N
	Sherry Stalls was nothing but a whiny,
	多嘴的腹黑小人而已\N
	gossipy, backsstabbing flirt.
	头发长见识短\N
	All hair and no substance.
	而且他竟然\N
	And there she was...
	和布莱斯牵着手 那可是我家布莱斯\N
	...holding hands with Bryce. my Bryce.
	那是我要贡献初吻的人啊\N
	The one who was walking around with my first kiss.
	我决定忽略她\N
	My solution was to ignore her.
	我知道布莱斯的性格\N
	I knew a boy of Bryce's caliber.
	总有一天能意识到\N
	...would eventually see through a
	雪莉 斯道尔有多浅薄无知\N
	shallow conniver like Sherry Stalls.
	只过了一周 他们果然分手了\N
	It took all of a week. they broke up at recess.
	看得出她很生气\N
	She didn't take it well.
	自从布莱斯脱离了雪莉的魔掌\N
	Now that Bryce was out of Sherry's evil
	他开始对我友善起来\N
	clutches, he started being nice to me
	- 嗨 朱莉 - 嗨 布莱斯\N
	- hi, Juli. - hi, Bryce.
	他是如此腼腆可人\N
	He was so shy and so cute...
	就连他的头发都散发着西瓜的清香\N
	...and his hair, it smelled like watermelon.
	我简直如痴如醉\N
	I couldn't get enough of it.
	一年来 我都在偷偷地闻着他的发丝\N
	I spent the whole year secretly sniffing watermelon...
	期盼着何时能送走我的初吻\N
	...and wondering if i was ever going to get my kiss.
	升入七年级后 生活变了样\N
	Seventh grade brought changes, all right.
	但最大的变化并非发生在学校\N
	But the biggest one didn't happen at school.
	而是在家中\N
	It happened at home.
	外公搬来与我们同住\N
	My grandfather came to live with us.
	妈妈说 他如此凝望 只因心念外婆\N
	Mom said he stared like that because he missed grandma.
	那不是外公会\N
	That was not something grandpa
	跟我聊起来的事\N
	would ever talk about with me
	事实上 我们几乎\N
	As a matter of fact, he never talked
	从未有过交流\N
	about much of anything with me
	直到那天 朱莉的名字登上了报纸\N
	That is, until Juli appeared in the local newspaper.
	- 布莱斯 可以和你聊聊吗 - 怎么了\N
	- oh, Bryce. may i speak with you? - what?
	坐吧 孩子\N
	Have a seat, son.
	跟我讲讲你朋友朱莉贝克吧\N
	Tell me about your friend Juli Baker.
	其实朱莉算不上我朋友\N
	Juli. she's not exactly my friend.
	为什么\N
	Oh. why's that?
	您为什么这么好奇\N
	Why do you wanna know?
	朱莉贝克登上报纸\N
	Now, Juli Baker did not wind up in the mayfield times...
	可不是因为她天赋异禀\N
	...for being an eighth-grade einstein.
	
	本地女孩赖在树上
	而是因为她赖在无花果树上\N
	No, she got front-page coverage because she
	死活不肯下来\N
	refused to climb out of a sycamore tree
	朱莉贝克和那棵无花果树\N
	Juli Baker and that stupid sycamore tree.
	她总觉得那棵树是上帝的恩赐\N
	She always thought it was god's gift
	使我们这个小地方也能熠熠生辉\N
	to our little corner of the universe
	嗨 布莱斯 要不要过来\N
	Hey, Bryce. wanna come climb the
	我们一起爬树呀 很好玩的\N
	tree with me and my brothers. it's fun
	不了 谢谢\N
	No, thanks.
	布莱斯 来吧 很好玩的 你能看到所有的东西呢\N
	Bryce. come up here. it's fun. You can see everything.
	我没时间\N
	I can't.
	我爸叫我帮他修\N
	My dad needs me to help him fix...
	修个东西\N
	...a thing.
	拉倒吧\N
	That's all i needed.
	让我和朱莉贝克一起爬树\N
	Climb up a tree with Juli Baker.
	我马上就掉回二年级的噩梦里去\N
	I'd be dragged right back into the second grade.
	布莱斯和朱莉爬上树梢\N
	Bryce and Juli sitting in a tree.
	还不如让我下半辈子吃青豆度日呢\N
	Why don't you just make me eat lima beans for the rest of me life.
	还有三个街区\N
	It's three blocks away.
	两个街区\N
	Two blocks.
	一个\N
	One block away.
	搞得好像多了不起似的\N
	like that's valuable information.
	明明很惹人厌\N
	- I hate it when she does that
	我还想着\N
	I like to think there's at least
	万一校车不会来呢\N
	a chance the bus won't show
	这棵树在晨曦中尤为美丽 你觉得呢\N
	I think the tree looks particularly beautiful in this light,don't you
	如果你的美丽指的是极其丑陋的话\N
	If by "beautiful" you mean "unbelievably
	没错 它很美丽\N
	ugly," then, yesa painting of it
	你眼神不好吧 我真同情你\N
	You're just visually challenged. i feel sorry for you.
	眼神不好\N
	"visually challenged"?
	眼神不好\N
	"visually challenged"?
	这竟然是出自\N
	This from the girl who lived in a house
	自家房子是邻里笑料的人之口\N
	that was the joke of the neighborhood
	窗前爬满灌木\N
	They had bushes growing over windows
	门前杂草丛生\N
	and weeds all over the place
	我爸爸都为此不爽\N
	It bugged my dad bigtime.
	噢 看呀\N
	Oh, there he is.
	一个自以为是画家的砌墙工\N
	The bricklayer who thinks he's a painter.
	那破车都丑成这样了\N
	that truck's not ugly enough in real life
	还得画幅画裱起来吗\N
	He's gotta make a painting of it?
	他画的美景在集市上可是很抢手的\N
	No, he does landscapes. sells them at the county fair.
	人们都觉得画得好\N
	People say they're beautiful.
	风景画 我跟你说吧\N
	Landscapes? let me tell you something.
	如果他能把他的破院子\N
	The world would have more beauty in it...
	美化一点点\N
	...if he'd do a little landscaping on
	世界都会因此美丽不少的\N
	that piece of crap he calls a yard
	真同情他的妻子 嫁给了一个空想家\N
	I feel bad for his wife. she married a dreamer.
	梦想与现实间的冲突\N
	Because of that, one of the two
	总得会不那么愉快的\N
	of them will always be unhappy
	没错 可为什么还要牵连我们\N
	Yeah, fine. but why do we have to be unhappy?
	和她家的脏院子相比\N
	As annoying as the yard was to my dad...
	还是树上的朱莉贝克\N
	...it was nothing compared to how
	更为恼人\N
	annoying Juli Baker was in that tree
	还有三个街区\N
	Three blocks away.
	每天早上我们都要忍受\N
	Every morning we had to listen to the sound...
	她不厌其烦的预报\N
	...of her blow-by-blow traffic report.
	两个街区\N
	Two blocks.
	到啦\N
	There you go.
	为什么要叫他们三个臭皮匠呢\N
	Why do they call it the three stooges?
	- 明明有五个人 - 什么\N
	- i mean, there's five of them. - what?
	你看啊 蘑菇头 拉里 胖子 西普和卷毛乔伊\N
	Well, yeah, there's moe, larry, curly, shemp and curly joe.
	没错 但每次只有三个人出场\N
	- yeah, but they only have three at a time. - yeah.
	你知道吗 我讨厌乔伊\N
	You know, i hate curly joe. i mean,
	他根本算不上臭皮匠\N
	he shouldn't even be a stooge
	姑娘 我可要报警了\N
	Listen, girl, i'm this close to calling the police.
	你这是侵犯私人领地\N
	You are trespassing and obstructing
	妨碍施工\N
	progress on a contracted job
	怎么了\N
	Guys, what's going on?
	要么你自己下来 要么砍树了\N
	Either you come down... or we gonna cut you down.
	你们快上来\N
	You guys, come up here with me.
	我们都在树上他们就不敢砍的\N
	They won't cut it down if we're all up here.
	- 车车车 - 朱莉真是疯了\N
	- Bus, bus, bus. - Juli was frantic.
	他们想要砍掉她的树\N
	They wanted to cut down her tree.
	我真不明白\N
	I couldn't understand why that
	那颗树枝畸形的树为什么对她那么重要\N
	mutant tangle of gnarly branches meant so much to her
	- 布莱斯 求你了 - 我同情她\N
	- Bryce, please. - I feel bad for her.
	别管她\N
	Leave her.
	但我不想因此逃课\N
	But i wasn't about to cut school over it.
	快点 老铁\N
	Come on, bro.
	你为什么不把她当朋友呢\N
	Why isn't she your friend, Bryce?
	等您真正了解她您就明白了\N
	You'd have to know Juli.
	我倒真挺想认识她\N
	Well, i'd like to.
	为什么\N
	Why?
	这姑娘挺有骨气\N
	That girl has an iron backbone.
	要不你什么时候请她过来玩吧\N
	Why don't you invite her over sometime?
	有骨气\N
	An iron backbone?
	她那是顽固\N
	She's just stubborn...
	还没有自知之明\N
	...and she's pushy beyond belief.
	是吗\N
	Is that so?
	她从二年级开始就缠着我\N
	And she's been stalking me since the second grade.
	不是每个人都能和这样的女孩子做邻居\N
	Well, a girl like that doesn't live next door to everyone.
	他们逃过一劫\N
	Lucky them.
	读读这个\N
	Read this.
	抛开你的偏见\N
	Without prejudice.
	跟我有多想了解她似的\N
	Like i needed to know anything more about Juli Baker.
	
	赖在树上的女孩
	朱莉第二天早上不在公交站台\N
	Juli wasn't at the bus stop the next morning.
	之后也不在\N
	Or the morning after that.
	她去了学校 但不知道怎么去的\N
	She was at school, but you'd never know it.
	小不点乔 他脸上妆太浓了\N
	little joe? he's got so much
	他又不老\N
	makeup on... - He doesn't age.
	我告诉自己我该庆幸\N
	I told myself i should be glad about it.
	这不就是我一直盼着的吗\N
	I mean, isn't that what i'd always wanted?
	不过我还是为她感到难过\N
	But still, i felt bad for her.
	我本来准备去和她道个歉\N
	I was gonna tell her i was sorry,
	但是随即我想到 不行 我不能这么干\N
	but then i thought... no, that's the last thing i needed.
	朱莉贝克会以为我想念她\N
	Juli Baker thinking i missed her.
	我明白你为什么喜欢待这儿\N
	I see why you like to come out here.
	你能帮我跟你妈解释一下吗\N
	Would you mind explaining it to your mother?
	我喜欢看我爸画画\N
	I loved to watch my father paint.
	事实上 我更爱在我爸画画时和他聊天\N
	Or really, i loved to hear him talk while he painted.
	这帮助我了解他\N
	I learned a lot about my dad that way.
	他什么都跟我说\N
	He told me all sorts of things...
	比如他怎么找到的第一份运送干草的工作\N
	...like how he got his first job delivering hay
	还有他希望能完成学业\N
	and how he'd wished he'd finished college
	有一天他的举动让我出乎意料\N
	Then one day he surprised me.
	你和那个布莱斯 洛斯基怎么了\N
	What's going on with you and, uh, Bryce Loski?
	什么意思 我们没什么\N
	What do you mean? nothing.
	喔 好吧\N
	Oh, okay.
	我不该问的\N
	My mistake.
	你问这个干什么\N
	Why would you even think that?
	没什么\N
	No reason.
	只是你\N
	Just that you...
	整天讨论他\N
	...talk about him all the time.
	我有吗\N
	I do?
	是哦\N
	Mm-hm.
	我不知道\N
	I don't know.
	我猜是因为他的眼睛\N
	I guess it's something about his eyes.
	或者他的笑容\N
	Or maybe his smile.
	那他这个人怎么样\N
	But what about him?
	- 什么 - 你需要看整体\N
	- what? - you have to look at the whole landscape.
	那是什么意思\N
	What does that mean?
	一幅画的整体效果远比细节重要\N
	A painting is more than the sum of its parts.
	一头牛只是一头牛\N
	A cow by itself is just a cow.
	一片草地本身只是长满了花和草\N
	A meadow by itself is just grass, flowers.
	穿过树丛的阳光\N
	And the sun peeking through the
	仅仅只是一束光线\N
	trees is just a beam of light.
	但是当你把他们组合在一起\N
	But you put them all together...
	它可以变成奇迹\N
	...and it can be magic.
	我不是很理解他的话\N
	I didn't really understand what he
	直到有一天下午\N
	was saying until one afternoon..
	我爬上无花果树\N
	...when i was up in the sycamore tree.
	准备去解一只风筝\N
	I was rescuing a kite.
	那太高了 我从没爬这么高过\N
	It was a long way up, higher than i'd ever been.
	我爬得越高 越是被眼前的风景震撼到\N
	And the higher i got, the more amazed i was by the view.
	我享受微风中奇妙的芬芳\N
	I began to notice how wonderful the breeze smelled.
	就像阳光和野草\N
	Like sunshine and wild grass.
	我不断大口呼吸着\N
	I couldn't stop breathing it in...
	让这些陌生而甜美的气息充斥我的肺\N
	...filling my lungs with the sweetest smell i'd ever known.
	嘿 你找到我的风筝了\N
	Hey, you found my kite.
	布莱斯 你该上来瞧瞧\N
	Bryce, you should come up here.
	这儿太美了\N
	It's so beautiful.
	我不能 我扭伤了我的 呃\N
	I can't. i sprained my, um...
	我得了皮疹\N
	I have a rash.
	从那刻开始 那里成了我的基地\N
	From that moment on, that became my spot.
	我可以长时间坐在这儿 只为了观察这个世界\N
	I could sit there for hours, just looking out at the world.
	有时候落日会呈现出粉紫色\N
	Some days the sunsets would be purple and pink.
	有时候会是耀眼的橙色\N
	And some days they were a blazing orange...
	染上整片天际的云彩\N
	...setting fire to the clouds on the horizon.
	有天在欣赏这迷人的落日时\N
	It was during one of those sunsets that my father's idea...
	我突然理解了爸爸说的\N
	...of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts...
	整体胜过局部的概念\N
	...moved from my head to my heart.
	有时候我会起个大早\N
	Some days i would get there extra
	去看日出\N
	early to watch the sunrise
	有一天早上 当我正在打着腹稿\N
	One morning i was making mental notes...
	想着怎么向我爸爸描绘\N
	...of how the streaks of light
	丝丝缕缕的光线\N
	were cutting through the clouds
	穿透云层的景象\N
	...so i could tell my dad...
	我听到底下一阵嘈杂\N
	...when i heard a noise below.
	不好意思\N
	Excuse me.
	不好意思 你们不能\N
	Excuse me. i'm sorry, but you can't
	把车停这儿 这是公交站台\N
	park there. That's a bus stop.
	嘿 你在上面干什么\N
	Hey, what are you doing up there?
	你得下来 我们需要把这大家伙砍下来\N
	You can't be up there, we're gonna take this thing down.
	- 这棵树 - 是的 现在赶紧下来\N
	- the tree? - yeah. now come on down.
	- 谁允许你们砍树的 - 这儿的主人\N
	- but who told you, you could cut it down? - the owner.
	为什么\N
	Why?
	他准备在这里盖房子 这棵树妨碍了他\N
	He's gonna build a house, and this tree's in the way.
	所以快下来吧姑娘 我们要开工了\N
	so come on, girl, we got work to do.
	你们不能砍了它 就是不能\N
	you can't cut it. You just can't.
	听着女孩 你再这样我要报警了\N
	Listen, girl. i'm this close to calling the police.
	你这是擅自入侵私人空间\N
	You are trespassing and obstructing
	和妨碍正常作业\N
	progress on a contract job
	现在你要么下来 要么我们就直接砍了\N
	Now either you come down, or we're gonna cut you down.
	砍吧 连我一起砍下来好了\N
	Go ahead. cut me down.
	我是不会下来的 我永远不下来\N
	I'm not coming down. i'm never coming down.
	布莱斯 你们快上来和我一起\N
	Bryce. you guys, come up here with me.
	如果我们都在上面他们就不会砍树了\N
	They won't cut it down if we're all up here.
	布莱斯求求你 别让他们砍树好吗\N
	Bryce, please don't let them do this.
	求你们了\N
	Come on, you guys.
	布莱斯 求你了 你不用爬\N
	Bryce, please. you don't have to come
	这么高 就上来一点点就好\N
	up this high. just a little way.
	布莱斯 求你了 求你\N
	Bryce, please. please.
	接下来发生的事都很模糊\N
	What happened after that was a blur.
	看上去整个镇上的人都来了\N
	It seemed like the whole town was there.
	但我始终不肯动\N
	But still i wouldn't move.
	然后我爸爸出现了\N
	Then my father showed up.
	他和消防员商量让他搭着救生梯爬到了我这儿\N
	He talked a fireman into letting him come up to where i was.
	宝贝 是时候该下去了\N
	Sweetie, it's time to come down.
	爸爸 求你别让他们砍树\N
	Daddy, please don't let them do this.
	- 宝贝儿 - 爸爸 你看\N
	- sweetie... - daddy, look.
	在这里可以看到一切 你可以\N
	You can see everything. you can
	从这儿看到整个世界\N
	see the whole world from here.
	没有什么风景比我女儿的安全更重要 现在 下来吧\N
	No view is worth my daughter's safety. now, come on.
	我不要\N
	I can't.
	朱莉安娜 现在跟我下来\N
	Julianna, it's time to come down now.
	求你了 爸爸\N
	Please, daddy.
	听话\N
	It's time.
	就这样结束了\N
	And that was it.
	我起码痛哭了两个礼拜\N
	I must've cried for two weeks straight.
	当然 我还是在上学并且尽我所能认真学习\N
	Oh, sure, i went to school and did the best i could...
	但是我失去了支柱\N
	...but nothing seemed to matter.
	- 朱莉 - 啊\N
	- Juli? - huh?
	你知道答案吗\N
	Do you know the answer?
	呃 伯罗奔尼撒战争\N
	Uh, the peloponnesian war?
	我确信这是某个问题的答案\N
	I'm sure that's the answer to something...
	但我问的是平行四边形的面积\N
	...but i was looking for the area of a rhomboid.
	不知道为什么 平行四边形和等腰直角三角形\N
	Somehow, rhomboids and isosceles right triangles...
	对我来说都不重要\N
	...didn't seem so important.
	我开始骑自行车上学 为了避免经过树桩\N
	I rode my bike so i wouldn't have to pass by the stump...
	对我来说那曾经是一棵世界上\N
	...that used to be the earth's
	最伟大的无花果树\N
	most magnificent sycamore tree.
	但是不管我怎么避开它 我还是忍不住想到它\N
	But no matter what i did, i couldn't stop thinking about it.
	你还好吗\N
	Are you okay?
	那只是一棵树\N
	It was just a tree.
	不 那不仅仅是一棵树\N
	No, it wasn't just a tree.
	我不希望你忘记\N
	I never want you to forget how
	这棵树带给你的奇妙感受\N
	you felt when you were up there.
	谢谢你 爸爸\N
	Thanks, dad.
	这是我每天睁开眼睛见到的第一个画面\N
	It was the first thing i saw every morning...
	也是我闭上眼睛前见到的最后一个画面\N
	...and the last thing i saw before i went to sleep.
	直到有一天我不会对着它流泪\N
	And once i could look at it without crying...
	我领悟到了比树和发生过的事\N
	...i saw more than the tree and
	更多的东西\N
	what being up there meant to me.
	我发现我观察周围\N
	I saw the day that my view of
	事情的角度开始改变了\N
	things around me started changing.
	我思考着 我是否\N
	And i wondered, did i still feel
	还对布莱斯抱有感情\N
	the same thing about Bryce?
	我对鸡蛋不是特别感兴趣\N
	I've never been a huge fan of eggs.
	我的意思是 吃不吃鸡蛋我都无所谓\N
	I mean, i could always just take them or leave them.
	直到有一天 在斯凯勒布朗家的车库里\N
	That is, until one day in skyler brown's garage...
	我对鸡蛋开始打心底感到厌恶\N
	...when my feelings about eggs were solidified.
	嘿 嘿嘿 伙计们 埃德娜决定好她的早餐了\N
	Hey, hey, hey. guys. Edna's found her breakfast.
	要我说 如果黏滑的爬行动物觉得蛋合胃口\N
	I mean, if a slimy reptile found them appetizing...
	那么它绝对不会再出现在我的食用菜单里\N
	...there was certainly no place for them in my diet.
	哥们 这太酷了\N
	Oh, man, that's so cool.
	她甚至不用咀嚼\N
	She doesn't even have to chew. i mean,
	想想这省了多少时间\N
	think of all the time you'd save.
	要不是我姐姐丽奈特\N
	I could've gone my whole life not
	我这辈子都不用看到\N
	knowing that snakes eat eggs raw.
	蛇生吞蛋这种戏码\N
	...if it hadn't been for lynetta.
	她和斯凯勒布朗要商量关于联赛的事情\N
	She had a major-league thing for skyler brown.
	这太野蛮了\N
	I think it's gross.
	他和朱莉的哥哥 马特马克 组成了一个乐队\N
	He and Juli's brothers, matt and mark, had formed a band.
	丽奈特会看他们表演\N
	And lynetta would watch them practice.
	真高明\N
	That is so neat.
	你觉得呢 布莱斯\N
	How about that, huh, Bryce?
	是啊 高明\N
	Yeah. neat.
	布莱斯 你猜他该怎么消化\N
	So, Bryce, how do you think he's gonna digest that?
	- 胃酸 - 没这么简单\N
	- stomach acid? - you'd like to think that.
	等着 大家安静 好戏开始了\N
	Wait, everybody quiet. here he goes.
	轻松解决\N
	Eggs over easy.
	恶心 恶心 恶心 太恶心了\N
	Gross. gross, gross, gross.
	等等 你还没看到最精彩的部分\N
	Wait, wait. you haven't seen the best part.
	呕\N
	Ugh!
	想吐\N
	Gross.
	我试图装作毫不在意 但并不起效\N
	I tried to be casual about it, but it didn't take.
	我开始做噩梦\N
	I started having bad dreams.
	我被困在了一个大鸡蛋里\N
	I'd be trapped inside a huge egg...
	怪物会张大\N
	...and this monster would open
	他的嘴并开始吞食我\N
	his jaws and start to devour me.
	我每次都及时醒过来\N
	I'd wake up just in time.
	但是很快真正的噩梦出现了\N
	Then the real nightmare began.
	嗨 布莱斯 我给你们家带来了这个\N
	Hi, Bryce. i brought these over for you and your family.
	- 我的鸡开始下蛋了 - 什么\N
	- my chickens are laying eggs. - what?
	你记得艾比 邦妮 克莱德\N
	You remember Abby and Bonnie and Clyde
	德克斯特 尤妮斯和弗洛伦斯吗\N
	and Dexter and Eunice and Florence?
	那些我在科技展览会上孵化的小鸡\N
	the ones i hatched for the science fair.
	当然记得\N
	How could I forget?
	那真是典型的朱莉贝克式事迹\N
	It was classic Juli Baker.
	她完全成了整个展览会的焦点\N
	She totally dominated the fair.
	就因为她的实验是\N
	And get this, her project was all
	观察无聊的小鸡出壳\N
	about watching boring eggs hatch
	我可是准备了火山爆发的现场模拟\N
	I mean, here i had a live-action erupting volcano...
	但是所有人在意的都是朱莉的无聊透顶的鸡\N
	...and all anyone cared about was Juli's boring chicks...
	挣破它们无趣的壳\N
	...breaking out of their boring shells.
	欧 我觉得最后一只也要出壳了\N
	Oh, i think the last one's hatching.
	是的 它正在孵化\N
	Oh, it's hatching.
	孩子们 到这儿来\N
	Kids, come over here.
	好吧 她赢了 我输了\N
	But hey, she won. i lost.
	我被彻底无视了\N
	I've never been one to dwell.
	它出来了\N
	Here it comes.
	但是这并不意味着我得吃她可恶的鸡蛋\N
	But that didn't mean i had to eat her lousy eggs.
	我觉得朱莉送我们这些鸡蛋真是太贴心了\N
	I think it was very sweet of Juli to bring us those eggs.
	不关我的事 我明天还是要吃麦片\N
	I don't care. i'm still having cereal tomorrow.
	我们怎么确定这些蛋里就没有雏鸡呢\N
	Yeah, how do we know there's no chicks in one of those eggs?
	我小时候常常吃新鲜的鸡蛋\N
	I used to eat farm-fresh eggs when
	它们很美味\N
	i was a kid. They were delicious.
	当然 它们当然好吃\N
	Yeah, well, that's all well and good...
	但是万一我们敲开一颗蛋发现里面有小鸡尸体滑出来呢\N
	...but what if we crack one open and a dead chick falls out?
	他们养公鸡了吗 如果没有\N
	Do they have a rooster? if they don't
	那么鸡蛋是不会受精的\N
	have a rooster the eggs can't be fertile.
	而如果他们养了公鸡 我们会知道的\N
	And if they had a rooster, we'd know.
	公鸡叫声所有邻居都能听到\N
	the whole neighborhood would know.
	也许他们给公鸡做了变声\N
	Maybe they got it de-yodeled.
	变什么\N
	"de-yodeled"?
	就是 处理了一下公鸡\N
	You know. de-cock-a-doodle-doo'd.
	你在说什么乱七八糟的\N
	What the hell are you talking about?
	就像弄哑狗狗\N
	Like they de-bark dogs.
	布莱斯 你为什么不直接问问朱莉呢\N
	Bryce, why don't you just ask Juli?
	什么\N
	What?
	你不敢跟她说话\N
	you afraid to talk to her?
	我没有不敢跟她说话\N
	i'm not afraid to talk to Juli.
	是你不敢吧\N
	I know you are, but what am i?
	- 好了 只要找她问清楚 - 布莱斯\N
	- okay. just talk to her and find out. - Bryce.
	你能分辨出公鸡吗\N
	How do you tell if one's a rooster?
	- 当然 公鸡体型更大 羽毛更长 - 嗯哼\N
	- well, a rooster's bigger. longer feathers. - mm-hm.
	它们头上长着红色的鸡冠\N
	They've got that red stuff growing out of their head.
	脖子周围也是红色的\N
	and around their neck too.
	那应该不难辨认\N
	That shouldn't be too hard to spot.
	不过你想\N
	Although, come to think of it,
	小鸡也有富有弹性的红色部分\N
	chickens have the rubbery red stuff too.
	只是没有那么多\N
	Just not as much.
	加勒特对公鸡的专业了解\N
	Garrett's expertise in roosters...
	是我们计划避开接触朱莉\N
	...was the cornerstone of our plan
	的关键\N
	to avoid contact with Juli Baker.
	剩下包括躲在她家的后院围栏外悄悄观察\N
	The balance of which involved spying over her back fence.
	- 上这儿来 - 嘘\N
	- come on, come on. - shh. shh.
	这边\N
	Over here.
	我看不到那些蠢鸡\N
	I can't see the stupid chickens.
	我们得让它们离开笼子\N
	We gotta get them out of the coop.
	有公鸡吗\N
	Is that a rooster?
	不 看起来是小鸡\N
	No, it looks like a chicken.
	你怎么分辨的\N
	How can you tell?
	跟你说不清楚\N
	It just does.
	看到我说的了吧 这就是专家\N
	See what i mean? expertise.
	- 嘘 - 怎么了\N
	- shh, shh! - what?
	朱莉\N
	Juli.
	这里 伙计们\N
	Here, guys.
	出来 开饭了\N
	Go on, there you go.
	- 这儿 伙计们 - 是的 它们都是小鸡\N
	- here, guys. go on. - yeah, they're all chickens.
	- 没有公鸡吗 - 我刚刚怎么说的来着\N
	- There's no rooster? - What did i just say?
	你怎么知道的\N
	How can you tell?
	- 没有鸡是昂首阔步走的 - 这儿 来啊\N
	- Well,none of them are strutting. - Here,come on.
	- 公鸡那么走路吗 - 过来啊\N
	- Roosters strut? - Come on,guys.
	- 我刚怎么说的又忘了 - 这儿\N
	- What did I just say? - Here.
	而且 它们都没有红色的鸡冠\N
	Plus, hardly any of them have any rubbery red stuff.
	- 你们在干什么呢 - 它们绝对都是鸡\N
	- What are you doing? - Yeah. They're definitely all chickens.
	他们都是鸡\N
	They're all chickens.
	我真为你骄傲 布莱斯\N
	I'm proud of you, Bryce.
	- 你战胜了你的恐惧 - 哈\N
	- You overcame your fear. - Huh?
	- 你跟她交流过了 - 嗯 是的\N
	- You talked to her. - Oh, heh. yeah.
	没什么大不了的\N
	It's no big deal.
	她是那么说的吗 都是鸡\N
	That's what she told you? They're all chickens?
	没错\N
	Yeah.
	她是个天才 你们都是天才\N
	She's a genius. You're both genius
	鸡蛋孵出来的当然都是鸡 公鸡的小鸡也是鸡\N
	Of course they're all chickens. A rooster's chicken.
	问题是其中一个是公鸡还是全是母鸡啊\N
	The question is one of them a rooster or are they all hens?
	母鸡 母鸡怎么了吗\N
	Hens? Who said anything about hens?
	然后我猛然想起\N
	Then it hit me.
	加勒特对小鸡根本一无所知\N
	Garrett didn't know jack shit about chickens.
	- 公鸡都是昂首阔步吗 - 没错\N
	- Do roosters strut? - Yes, they do.
	那和这个又有什么关系\N
	What does that have to do with anything?
	她们全是母鸡\N
	They're all hens.
	好了 鸡蛋没问题才是最主要的\N
	Well, the main thing is the eggs are okay.
	别纠结了\N
	It's all settled.
	不是对我\N
	Not for me.
	我以后绝不可能再吃任何\N
	There was no way i was ever gonna eat anything
	和朱莉 贝克有关的东西\N
	that had anything to do with Juli Baker.
	- 我不会吃它们的  - 为什么\N
	I'm not eating them.  - Well, why not?
	你见过她们的院子吗 它\N
	Have you seen their yard? it's
	草都没有 全部是泥巴和鸡屎\N
	There's not even any grass. It's all mud and chicken turds.
	哟 真可怕   沙门氏菌\N
	Ew. gross. salmonella.
	你认为鸡蛋里可能有沙门氏菌吗\N
	Do you suppose they could have salmonella?
	- 不太可能 - 但为什么要冒这个风险呢\N
	- It's not very likely. - Why take the risk?
	那这些鸡蛋怎么办\N
	What do we do with the eggs?
	还回去\N
	Give them back.
	- 还给朱莉吗 - 没错\N
	- Give them back? to Juli? - Sure.
	你之前和她说过话 不是吗 那又不会杀了你\N
	You talked to her before, right? It didn't kill you.
	嗯 那我要怎么说\N
	Well, what do i say?
	告诉她我们不吃鸡蛋\N
	Tell her we don't eat eggs.
	额 我们对鸡蛋过敏什么的\N
	Uh, we're allergic to them or something.
	加油 动脑子想想啊\N
	Come on, use your brains.
	但我总觉得说谎是不好的\N
	It didn't feel right to lie.
	而且 就连小学生都知道\N
	Besides, even a seventh grader would know
	一家人不可能都对鸡蛋过敏\N
	that entire families aren't allerge to eggs
	但我也不想辜负朱莉的好意\N
	But i didn't wanna hurt her feelings either.
	所以我就只剩下一个选择\N
	So that left me with only one option.
	在我和朱莉 贝克的\N
	And thus another near-death experience
	紧张交锋中\N
	in my ongoing saga with Juli Baker
	我大多都胜利了\N
	had been succesd most of it.
	直到一周后\N
	Until one week later.
	嗨 布莱斯 我给你多带了些鸡蛋\N
	Hi, Bryce. Brought you some more eggs.
	哇哦\N
	Wow.
	- 谢谢 - 你家人喜欢第一盒鸡蛋吗\N
	- Thanks. - Did your family like the first batch?
	还用问吗\N
	Do you even have to ask?
	太好了 那学校见\N
	Great. See you at school.
	我寄希望的一次性事件\N
	What I hoped would be a one-time event
	却成了一种生活的开始\N
	was just the beginning of a life
	充满着谎言与欺骗\N
	consumed with lies,intrigue and deception
	每天早上我都会密切注意着朱莉\N
	Every morning i'd be on the lookout for Juli
	这样她来的时候\N
	so if she happened to come, I could
	我就能跑去开门\N
	whip the door open for a shut
	谢谢\N
	Thanks.
	然后在被人发现之前把鸡蛋丢掉\N
	Then I'd dump the eggs before anyone noticed.
	怎么会这样 为什么我就是不能面对她\N
	And why? Why couldn't i just face her?
	我为什么就是说不出 不用了 谢谢 我们不想要\N
	Why I just can't say "No, thanks. Don't want them.
	不需要 喂蛇去吧 这种话\N
	Don't need them.Give them to the snake"?
	难道是怕是伤她的心吗\N
	Was i really afraid of hurting her feelings
	还是我真的害怕她\N
	or was i just afraid of her?
	现在 你要确保你明白了\N
	Now, you wanna make sure you get it...
	当布鲁贝克女士第一次建议\N
	When Mrs. brubeck first suggested
	我把孵化鸡蛋作为我的研究课题时\N
	hatching eggs as my science project
	我并没有多么激动\N
	I was less than excited.
	直到我看到了生命中的第一个奇迹\N
	That is, until I saw my first sign of life.
	那就是小鸡吗\N
	Is that it?
	- 那就是胚胎 - 哇哦\N
	- That's the embryo. - Wow.
	- 它看起来像个小豆子 - 确实\N
	- It looks like a bean. - It does.
	我们来看看其他的\N
	Let's try the other ones.
	忽然我真切地感觉到\N
	Suddenly it felt real.
	所有的鸡蛋都是有生命的\N
	All the eggs were alive.
	就像 每个鸡蛋里都有个豆宝宝\N
	There were, like, little bean babies inside every one.
	在展览会上 六只小鸡都成功孵化了\N
	On the day of the fair, all six chicks hatched.
	这个几率多小啊\N
	What are the odds?
	今年的一等奖授予朱莉 贝克的课题\N
	This year's top prize goes to Juli Baker for her wonderful project
	鸡的诞生\N
	"a chicken is born."
	我获得了一等奖\N
	I won first place.
	我很开心 不过我真正在意的是\N
	And that was cool, but all I
	我的小鸡们\N
	really cared about are my chicks
	这边 这边 小家伙们\N
	There you go. there you go, guys.
	我妈妈不喜欢我们养鸡\N
	My mom wasn't crazy about us raising chickens.
	但是我一直求她\N
	But i begged and pleaded.
	我告诉她我能处理一切 我也做到了\N
	I told her i would take care of everything. and i did.
	克莱德哪去了\N
	Where's Clyde?
	克莱德\N
	Clyde?
	嘿 克莱德 怎么回事\N
	Hey, Clyde. What's the matter?
	你还好吗 你饿了吗\N
	Are you okay? Aren't you hungry?
	过来 怎么了 宝贝\N
	Come on. come here. what's wrong, baby?
	来这儿\N
	Come here.
	嘿 你不是克莱德了 你是克莱德妈妈了\N
	Hey, you're not clyde. you're clydette.
	妈\N
	Mom!
	结果是 我的鸡下的蛋我家根本吃不完\N
	As it turned out, my hens laid more eggs than we could eat.
	起初我们试着保持\N
	At first we tried to keep up
	但经过一个月的煮着吃 煎着吃 烤着吃\N
	but after a month of boiling, frying and deviling...
	就像电影运行怪物里一样\N
	like that movie the blob,
	我们实在受不了了\N
	We were being overtaken by eggs
	斯托比夫人的拜访\N
	Then opportunity in the form of our
	给事情带来了转机\N
	neighbor, Mrs. Steuby ,knocked
	你好 亲爱的\N
	Hello, dear.
	如果你们还有多余的鸡蛋\N
	If you ever have any extra,
	我很想买一些\N
	i'd be happy to buy them from  you
	- 真的吗 - 当然\N
	- really? - Certainly.
	而且我碰巧知道了赫尔姆斯女士\N
	And I happen to know that Mrs.
	也有兴趣\N
	Helms would be interested as well
	- 太棒了 - 没什么比鲜鸡蛋更好的了\N
	- Great. - Nothing like fresh eggs.
	- 谢谢你 斯托比夫人 - 亲爱的客气啦 拜\N
	- Thanks, Mrs. Steuby. - You bet, dear.Bye.
	斯托比和赫尔姆斯夫人\N
	Between Mrs. steuby and Mrs. helms,
	鸡蛋的问题解决了\N
	My egg overflow problem was solved.
	然后我发现洛斯基夫人也该有鸡蛋\N
	Then I realized that Mrs. Loski deserved eggs too.
	但是我觉得不该向她收钱\N
	But i didn't think it would be right to charge her.
	她是一个非常友善的邻居\N
	She had been such a good neighbor,
	当我们东西用完时她会借给我们家\N
	lending us suppliese when we ran out
	汽车熄火时还捎带过我妈妈一程\N
	giving my mother a ride when our car wouldn't start.
	这是我唯一能做的\N
	It was the least I could do.
	除此之外 如果碰巧遇到了布莱斯\N
	Besides, if I happened to run into Bryce,
	那就再好不过了\N
	that wouldn't be the end of the world
	嗨 布莱斯\N
	Hi, Bryce.
	我第三次送鸡蛋去洛斯基夫人家的时候\N
	By the third time I brought eggs over to the Loskis'
	我发现布莱斯在等我\N
	I realized Bryce was waiting for me.
	等着给我开门 并对我说\N
	Waiting to pull open the door and say,
	谢谢 朱莉 学校见\N
	"Thanks, Juli. See you at school.
	作为回报 我得到了一些能被布莱斯\N
	And in return, I got a few moments alone
	璀璨的目光注视的时光\N
	with the world's most dazzling eyes.
	谢谢 朱莉 学校见\N
	Thanks, Juli. See you at school.
	真是个好买卖\N
	It was a bargain.
	直到有一天\N
	Until the day it wasn't.
	那是无花果树被砍的两周后\N
	It was two weeks after the sycamore tree was cut down
	我重新开始适应的时候\N
	and I was just starting to feel normal again.
	嘿 朱莉 真准时啊\N
	Hey, Juli. Right on schedule.
	嗯 风雨无阻\N
	Yeah, well, neither rain nor sleet.
	- 啊 - 像邮递员一样\N
	- huh? - you know, the mailman thing?
	哦 没错\N
	Oh, right.
	所以 你还会坐校车吗\N
	So, um, will you start riding the bus again?
	我不知道 那之后我还没去过那儿\N
	I don't know. I haven't been up there since...
	看起来没那么糟了 都被清理干净了\N
	It doesn't look so bad anymore. It's all cleared away.
	好吧 我得准备去学校了\N
	Well, um, i better get ready for school.
	学校见\N
	Guess i'll see you there.
	拜拜\N
	See you.
	也许布莱斯是对的\N
	Maybe Bryce was right.
	也许是时候重新坐校车了\N
	Maybe it was time I started riding the bus again.
	毕竟 他不是说他希望我那么做吗\N
	After all, didn't he just tell me he wanted me to?
	难道布莱斯 洛斯基想我了\N
	Could it be that Bryce Loski actually misses me?
	朱莉 你还在那里干什么\N
	Juli? What are you still doing here?
	我在思考\N
	I was just thinking.
	今天是垃圾回收日 垃圾车就在前面\N
	It's pickup day. The cans are in front.
	知道 要帮忙吗\N
	I know. You need some help?
	不用了 我一会儿再丢吧\N
	No. maybe i'll do it later.
	那是我的鸡蛋吗\N
	Are those my eggs?
	嗯 我扔掉了\N
	Yeah. yeah, i dropped them.
	它们没烂啊\N
	They're not broken.
	为什么要扔了\N
	Why are you throwing them away?
	你不想要吗\N
	Don't you want them?
	不是我 我爸认为不应该冒风险\N
	It wasn't me. My dad didn't think it was worth the risk.
	风险 什么风险\N
	Risk? what risk?
	沙门氏菌\N
	Salmonella.
	什么 他担心中毒\N
	What are you talking about? He's afraid of being poisoned?
	嗯 朱莉 我是说 看看你家的院子\N
	Well, Juli, i mean, look at your
	简直一团糟\N
	back yard. it's completely a mess
	它就像铺满了粪便\N
	It's, like, covered in turds.
	胡说 我每天都在打扫\N
	That's not true. i clean up after my girls every day.
	我们只是不想伤害你的感情\N
	We just didn't wanna hurt your feelings.
	所以你一直都把鸡蛋扔掉了是吗\N
	Have you always thrown them away?
	知道吗 斯托比太太和赫尔姆斯太太花钱买我的鸡蛋\N
	You know, Mrs. Steuby and Mrs. Helms pay me for my eggs.
	- 是吗 - 60美分一打\N
	- they do? - they pay me 60 cents a dozen.
	我不知道\N
	I didn't know.
	你怎么能这样\N
	How could you?
	对不起\N
	I'm sorry.
	不 你没有感到惭愧\N
	No, you're not.
	很快我就意识到\N
	It didn't take me long to realize
	我和朱莉贝克除了旧恨\N
	that i'd traded in my old problems with Juli Baker
	又有了新仇\N
	for a whole set of new ones.
	她不理我的感觉比\N
	It was actually worse having her mad
	她惹我生气时的感觉还要糟\N
	at me than having her annoy me
	她的不理不睬一直提醒着我\N
	The way she ignored me was a constant reminder
	我曾是个混蛋\N
	that I'd been a jerk.
	有一天我在和加勒特打完球\N
	Then one day i was coming home from
	回家的路上\N
	playing basketball with Garrett
	发现了一件荒唐事\N
	and things got weird.
	别害羞 快来 不会弄伤它们的\N
	Don't be so timid. Come on, you won't hurt them.
	- 像这样吗 - 没错 就这样\N
	- Like this? - Yeah, that's it.
	我的爷爷\N
	My grandfather.
	我只见过他穿拖鞋\N
	All I ever saw him wear was slippers.
	而现在 他到哪里搞到的工作靴\N
	Now, where did he get those work boots
	我不由自主地朝那儿看\N
	I couldn't stop looking over there.
	结果越看越生气\N
	And the more i looked, the madder i got.
	我的爷爷已经和朱莉聊了超过一个小时\N
	My grandfather had already said more to Juli in one hour...
	比他从搬过来和我们一起住\N
	...than he'd said to me in the whole
	总共说的话还要多\N
	time he'd been living with us.
	我很确定我之前从未见他大笑过\N
	I was pretty sure I'd never seen him laugh.
	他和朱莉在干什么\N
	And what was his deal with Juli Baker?
	嗨 爷爷\N
	Hi, grandpa.
	朱莉和我说了鸡蛋的事\N
	Juli told me about the eggs.
	知道吗 布莱斯\N
	You know, Bryce
	一个人的性格是在年少时养成的\N
	One's character is set at an early age.
	我不想你在歧路上走的太远而无法回头\N
	I'd hate to see you swim out so far you can't swim back.
	什么\N
	Sir?
	这关乎诚信 孩子\N
	It's about honesty, son.
	有时开始的一点不舒服\N
	Sometimes a little discomfort in the beginning...
	能够避免一条充满痛苦的道路\N
	can save a whole lot of pain down the road.
	当朱莉 贝克生气的样子\N
	When it came to holding a grudge,
	真的是令人印象深刻\N
	Juli Baker was truly impressive
	整个星期我都想法儿在学校接近她\N
	All week i tried to approach her at school.
	她却总能找到办法躲我\N
	She'd always find some way to duck me.
	而她在她家的院子里的时候\N
	And whenever she was in her yard,
	我爷爷总是和她在一块儿\N
	grandpa was always there with her
	终于一个周六 我找到了机会\N
	Finally, one Saturday I saw my opening.
	我爷爷去了镇上买药了\N
	My grandfather had gone into town to buy some bengay.
	我猜整理院子的工作有点累到他了\N
	I guess the yard work was starting to get to him.
	看起来很不错\N
	It's looking real good.
	谢谢 大都是切特的功劳\N
	Thanks. Chet did most of it.
	我对我的所作所为很抱歉\N
	I'm sorry for what i did.
	我只是不明白 你为什么不直接和我说\N
	I just don't get it, Bryce. why didn't you just tell me?
	我不知道 当时我犯傻了\N
	I don't know. It was dumb.
	我也同样不该评论你家的院子\N
	And i shouldn't have said anything about your yard, either.
	那是不对的\N
	It wasn't right.
	也不尽然吧\N
	Maybe it's all for the best.
	知道吗 我从切特身上学到了很多 太棒了\N
	I mean, look, I learned so much from Chet, it's amazing.
	你真幸运\N
	You're lucky.
	我甚至都没有爷爷奶奶\N
	I don't even have grandparents anymore.
	哦\N
	Oh.
	我为他感到难过\N
	I feel sorry for him.
	他很想念你的奶奶\N
	He misses your grandma.
	你相信吗 他说我使他想起了她\N
	Can you believe it? he says i remind him of her.
	- 真的吗 - 我知道 我也这么说\N
	- what? - I know. that's what i said.
	他并不是那个意思 他说的是性格方面\N
	But he meant it in a nice way. something about her spirit.
	嗯\N
	Yeah.
	嗯\N
	Well...
	我想这些草一定会长得很好\N
	Good luck with the grass. I'm sure it'll come up great.
	谢谢\N
	Thanks.
	到时候见\N
	I guess i'll see you around.
	我想是吧\N
	I guess so.
	尽管朱莉 贝克的原谅\N
	While Juli's acceptance of my apology
	和我想象中的不太一样\N
	was not all that I hoped for
	不过鸡蛋的事总算过去了\N
	at least the eggs thing was finally behind me.
	几个月来我终于能享受观看伯南扎牛仔了\N
	The first time in months I could truly enjoy bonanza.
	你要去哪儿 怎么打扮成这样\N
	Where you going and why you dressed like that?
	斯凯勒家\N
	Skyler's.
	马特和马克要录唱片\N
	Matt and Mark are bringing over recording
	他们在准备唱片样本的录制\N
	stuff and they're preparing for a demo
	样本唱片 说的好像他们知道怎么弄一样\N
	Demo? Like they know how to make a demo.
	- 你根本不了解他们\N
	- You don't even know them.
	- 没必要 - 我了解那种人\N
	- I don't have to. I know the type
	- 你根本什么都不知道 - 别那样对我说话\N
	- You don't know anything. - Don't talk to me like that.
	- 我要迟到了 - 11点前回来\N
	- I'm late. - Be back by 11.
	好了 一切回归正常\N
	Yep. everything was back to normal.
	那女孩儿让你太累了吗\N
	Is that girl working you too hard?
	她的名字叫朱莉 还有\N
	That girl's name is Juli. and, no,
	她没有那样\N
	she isn't working me too hard
	你对她可真是好啊 不是吗\N
	You've developed quite a soft spot for her, huh?
	斯蒂文\N
	Steven.
	没事 帕蒂 我就是想知道\N

	when he won't throw a baseball
	一起打棒球\N
	around with his grandson
	- 没事的 爸爸 - 不 有事\N
	- It's okay, dad. - No, it's not okay.
	朱莉让爷爷他想起了奶奶\N
	Juli reminds him of grandma.
	蕾妮吗 呵\N
	Of Renee? heh.
	简直荒唐\N
	That's ridiculous.
	你知道为什么贝克一家一直没有修缮他们的院子吗\N
	You know why the Bakers' haven't fixed their yard?
	因为他忙着画画吧\N
	Yeah, because he's too busy with his paint-by-numbers kit.
	如果你有一个身患严重疾病的兄弟\N
	If you had a brother with a severe handicap
	你会怎么做\N
	What would you do
	那和这个又有什么关系\N
	What the hell does that have to do with anything?
	朱莉的爸爸有一个智力障碍的兄弟\N
	Juli's father has a retarded brother.
	那又如何 又不是让他修缮院子\N
	So what? He's not the gardener, is he? heh.
	- 斯蒂文 - 哈哈\N
	- Steven. - Ha-ha-ha.
	开个玩笑\N
	It was a joke.
	知道吗 每家人都有自己的难处\N
	You know, other people have family troubles
	他们已经在努力修剪草坪了\N
	and they manage to mow their own lawns.
	不知道他们有房子的那种自豪感去哪儿了\N
	I don't know where their pride in ownership is.
	那不是他们的房子\N
	They don't own that house.
	房东本该负责管理的\N
	The landlord's supposed to maintain it.
	贝克先生把所有剩余的钱\N
	Mr. Baker puts every extra penny he
	都拿去照顾他的兄弟了\N
	has to caring his brother
	出了这种事\N
	Don't they have government
	他们不去政府疗养院吗\N
	facilities for that sort of thing
	也许他们认为私人疗养院\N
	Maybe they thought that a private
	对他兄弟的病情更好吧\N
	facility would be better for him
	不管怎样 又不是我们的错\N
	Either way, it's not our fault that their
	让他们家染色体有异常的\N
	family has some chromosomal abnormalities
	这和染色体一点关系没有\N
	It has nothing to do with chromosomes.
	朱莉的叔叔出生时\N
	When Juli's uncle was born, he had the
	被脐带缠住了脖子\N
	umbilical cord wrapped neck
	如果他有足够的氧气 就会像你儿子一样\N
	If he'd had enough oxygen, he would've been
	是一个健康的小宝贝\N
	a perfect little baby just like your son

	让我静静\N
	Leave me alone!
	我感到很抱歉\N
	Sorry about that.
	为什么妈妈这么难过\N
	Why is mom so upset?
	因为\N
	Because...
	如果不是上帝施以恩德\N
	...but for the grace of god...
	你妈妈可能就会像贝克夫人一样\N
	...your mother could be standing in mr. Baker's shoes.
	她也有个弟弟被脐带绕颈吗\N
	Did her brother have the cord wrapped around his neck too
	是你\N
	You did.
	幸运的是 给你接生的医生\N
	Luckily, the doctor who delivered you
	医术高超 解开了缠绕的脐带\N
	was on the ball and got it untangled
	但一切差一点就截然不同了\N
	...but it easily could've gone the other way.
	- 想出去散散步吗 - 什么\N
	- wanna go for a walk - huh
	有助于理清思绪\N
	I find it helps clear the mind.
	如果我真的变成那样 他们会怎么做\N
	What would they have done with me
	别去仔细思考一些本可能发生的事 布莱斯\N
	You can't dwell on something that might've been, Bryce.
	我爸爸说的那些话 听起来像是\N
	The way my dad was talking, sounds like
	他会把我扔进精神病院\N
	he would've thrown me in a nuthouse.
	不 不对 这就不公平了\N
	No, no. now, that's not fair.
	你不能为一些没发生过的事埋怨他\N
	You can't condemn him for something he hasn't done.
	这就是那棵树 对吗\N
	This is where that tree was, wasn't it?
	是的\N
	Yeah.
	风景一定很美\N
	Must've been a spectacular view.
	她是个很好的女孩\N

	有的人黯淡浅薄\N
	Some of us get dipped in flat...
	有的人光彩万丈\N
	...some in satin...
	有的人败絮藏心\N
	...some in gloss.
	而当你无意间邂逅\N
	But every once in a while...
	一个灿若虹霓的人\N
	...you find someone who's iridescent.
	自此之后\N
	And when you do...
	世间只得一个她\N
	...nothing will ever compare.
	浅薄 光彩 败絮\N
	Flat, glossy, iridescent?
	这些到底是什么意思\N
	What the hell did that mean?
	对我来说 朱莉 贝克乏善可陈\N
	Juli Baker had always just seemed plain to me.
	直到现在\N
	Until now.
	还有当她说起\N
	And the way she talked about what it
	坐在那棵树上\N
	felt like to be up in that tree...
	置身云端 感受清风拂过时的样子\N
	...to be held above the earth, brushed by the wind.
	哪个初中生会像她一样\N
	Who in junior high talks like that?
	有种奇怪的感觉\N
	This weird feeling started taking
	开始在我内心深处扎根\N
	over in the pit of my stomach
	让我很不喜欢\N
	...and i didn't like it.
	我失误了\N
	I was slipping, man.
	是时候回归正轨了\N
	And it was time to get a grip.
	我以前从没为自己的住所感到过困窘\N
	I'd never been embarrassed by where we lived before.
	我也没仔细想过和钱有关的事\N
	I also never really thought about money.
	我知道我们不富有\N
	I knew we weren't rich, but i didn't
	但我也没觉得这有什么大碍\N
	feel like we were missing anything.
	直到布莱斯 洛斯基说我家简直是一团乱\N
	That is, until Bryce Loski called our home a complete mess.
	敢问芳名\N

	玛丽还是苏\N
	Is it mary or sue
	敢问芳名\N
	What's your name

	It's so hard to find a personality
	就像我眼中的你\N
	With charms like yours for me
	我得做点什么 我也很清楚该做什么\N
	I had to do something and i knew what it was.
	敢问芳名\N

	We'll record it in skyler's garage this weekend.
	很棒的计划啊\N
	That's a wonderful project.
	说到计划\N
	Speaking of projects, i was thinking
	我觉得修整一下院子应该会很棒\N
	it might be cool to fix up the yard.
	- 什么 - 我是说 草种又能花多少钱呢\N
	- what - i mean, how much can grass seed cost?
	我能种些草 或者花儿\N
	I could plant a lawn, maybe some flowers.
	甚至还能放些篱笆\N
	I could even put up a fence.
	宝贝 那是大人该操心的事\N
	Honey, that's a major undertaking.
	我可以用卖鸡蛋的钱来支付\N
	I could pay for it with my egg money.
	不用 那是你自己的钱\N
	No. That's your money.
	房东应该负责这一切\N
	The landlord should be the one taking care of all this.
	但他没有 住在这里的是我们\N
	But he doesn't. and we live here.
	院子看起来很糟糕\N
	And it looks so bad.

	What's going on?
	没事 爸爸\N
	Nothing, dad.

	It's okay, sweetheart.

	You can tell us.
	罗斯基家扔掉了我送的鸡蛋\N
	The Loskis have been throwing away my eggs
	他们怕沾染上沙门氏菌\N
	because they're afraid of salmonella.
	因为我们家院子一团乱\N
	Because our yard is such a mess.
	佩茜这么说了吗\N
	Did patsy say that?
	没有 是布莱斯说的\N
	No. Bryce did.
	但这一定是他们全家都在说\N
	But it must have been a family discussion.
	小男孩自己不会这么想\N
	A boy doesn't come up with that on his own.
	- 谁关心他们怎么想 - 对 谁管他们\N

	...every time ours breaks down.
	你以为这是我想让全家人过上的生活吗\N
	Do you think this is the life i pictured for us
	有时为了正确的事 你得做出牺牲\N
	Sometimes you have to sacrifice to do the right thing.
	我们最后总是一致认为 对于丹尼尔\N
	We always end up agreeing that devonhurst
	去德文霍斯特是正确的选择\N
	is the right thing for Daniel.
	那也许我们该想想\N
	Well, maybe we should start
	对我们来说正确的选择\N
	thinking about what's right for us.
	我们的女儿因为我们没有打理院子\N
	Our daughter is suffering because
	而受了委屈\N
	we won't fix up our own yard.
	这不是我们的院子\N
	It's not our yard.
	你怎么能这么说 理查德\N
	How can you say that, Richard? How?
	我们在这里住了十二年\N
	We've lived here for 12 years...
	十二年来我们一直在说\N
	...and for 12 years we've been
	这只是暂时的 但事实并非如此\N
	saying it's tempory, but it's not.
	这是我们的家\N
	This is our home.
	想要住在一个为之自豪的地方 难道错了吗\N
	Is it wrong to wanna live somewhere you can be proud of?
	想攒够钱送孩子去念大学 难道错了吗\N

	我想了想自己开始打理庭院的原因\N
	I wanted to think the reason i started working on my yard...
	和布莱斯没有关系\N
	...had nothing to do with Bryce.
	只是为了让我家变得更好\N
	it was about making our house better.
	在他那样对待我的鸡蛋之后\N
	After what he did with the eggs,
	我为什么还要在意他的想法\N
	why should i care what he thought?
	但我在意\N
	But i did.

	我们在院子里忙活了好几周\N
	We worked on the yard for weeks.
	几周来 我们一边干活 一边聊天\N
	And the whole time we worked, we talked.
	- 就在这里 - 完美\N
	- right there - perfect, yeah.
	他想知道关于无花果树的事\N
	He wanted to know more about the sycamore tree.
	而且他完全懂得\N
	He knew exactly what it meant...
	整体大于部分之和的道理\N
	...about the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.
	他说人也是一样的\N
	He said it was the same with people...
	只是有的人 从整体上看更加浅薄\N
	...but sometimes with people, the whole could be less.
	我觉得这很有趣\N
	I thought that was pretty interesting.
	我开始审视\N
	I started looking at people i'd
	那些我从小学就认识的人\N
	known since elementary school...
	想看看他们从整体来看\N
	...trying to figure out if they were more
	是比部分之和更好还是更坏\N
	or less than the sum of their parts.
	切特说得对 很多人的确不如他们的部分之和\N
	Chet was right. a lot of them were less.
	在所有的同学里 只有一个\N
	Of all my classmates, the one person
	我无法准确定位的人 布莱斯\N
	I couldn't seem to place was Bryce.
	如果是以前 我会很肯定\N
	Until recently, i would've said with absolute certainty...
	他的整体要远远地\N
	...that he was greater, far greater,
	大于部分之和\N
	than the sum of his parts.
	但现在我不那么确定了\N
	But now i wasn't so sure.
	看起来很棒 朱莉 你做得很好\N
	It's looking good, Juli. nice job.
	谢谢 大部分是切特的功劳\N
	Thanks. chet did most of it.
	我很抱歉做了那些事\N
	I'm sorry for what i did.
	我就是搞不懂 布莱斯\N
	I just don't get it, Bryce.
	你为什么不直接告诉我\N
	Why didn't you just tell me?
	他真的心怀歉意吗\N
	Was he really sorry?
	还是说 他说这些话\N
	Or was he just saying these things
	只为了让自己好过些\N
	to make himself feel better?
	然后我想 也许我只是\N
	Then i thought maybe i just wanted him
	期待他能比他的部分之和更好\N
	to be more than the sum of his parts.
	但当我直视他的眼睛\N
	But as i looked into his eyes...
	那双光彩夺目的眼睛\N
	...those dazzling eyes...
	第一次\N
	...for the first time...
	我很确定布莱斯 洛斯基是另一种的人\N
	...I was pretty sure that Bryce Loski was less.
	我们要邀请贝克一家来共进晚餐\N
	We're going to invite the Bakers over for dinner.
	- 什么 - 我怎么都不知道 妈妈\N
	- What? - I don't know, Mom.
	我觉得这个主意很棒\N
	I think that's a marvelous idea.
	佩茜 为什么这么做\N
	Patsy, what purpose does this serve?
	特瑞娜 贝克是个很好的人\N
	Trina Baker is a very nice person.
	- 而且马特和马克真的很酷 - 我讨厌装酷的孩子\N
	- and Matt and Mark are really cool. - I hate cool.
	这事我们多年前就该做了\N
	Something we should've done years ago.
	没错 但我们以前没做 现在也不能做\N
	Yeah, but we didn't. and now we can't.
	早过时了\N
	The statute of limitations has run out.
	我们一定要请贝克家来吃晚餐\N
	We're having the Bakers over for dinner.
	如果是因为我昨晚说的话 我道歉 行吗\N
	If this is about what i said last night, i'm sorry, okay
	但是 就算邀请他们来吃晚餐\N
	But, you know, having them over for
	他的弟弟也治不好了\N
	dinner is not gonna fix his brother.
	这是个正式的晚宴\N
	It's going to be a sit-down dinner.
	我希望所有人都能穿得正式些\N

	天哪 我们就不能烤个肉吗\N

	So that was it.
	不久以后 我就会和朱莉 贝克\N
	A dress-up, sit-down dinner with Juli
	盛装吃晚宴\N
	Baker was in my immediate future.
	这让我在学校看到朱莉的时候更不自在了\N
	And that made seeing Juli at school more uncomfortable.
	我发现自己会在课上盯着她看\N
	I found myself staring at her in class.
	当她的秀发从肩膀上滑落\N
	And the way her hair fell back over her shoulders...
	她看起来就像报纸上照片里的人\N
	...she looked just like the picture in the newspaper.
	达娜 特雷斯勒注意到了我的视线\N
	Dana tressler caught me watching.
	如果我不快速地做出反应\N
	If i didn't do something fast,
	传言就会像野火一样散播\N
	this could spread like wildfire.
	她的头发上有只蜜蜂\N
	There was a bee in her hair.
	看 往那边飞了\N
	See, there it goes.
	我没看见蜜蜂\N
	There's no bee.
	从窗子飞出去了\N
	It flew out the window.
	我庆幸自己躲过一劫\N
	I convinced myself i'd dodged a bullet.
	我必须让朱莉从我脑海中消失\N
	I had to put Juli out of my mind.
	把注意力放在更重要的事情上 比如学习\N
	Keep the focus on the important stuff like schoolwork.
	我的弱点就在于容易紧张\N
	My weakness was unnerving.
	我要用你的削笔刀\N
	I need your sharpener.
	- 你敲门了吗 - 嘿\N
	- You ever heard of knocking - Hey,
	你藏什么呢 老爸的花花公子杂志吗\N
	what you got there? Dad's Playboy?
	不关你的事\N
	None of your business.
	- 替我向十月女郎问好 - 快出去\N
	- Give my best to Miss October. - Get out.
	- 你还是忙着替自己问候吧 - 真恶心\N
	- Or should i say your best ha, ha. - You're disgusting.
	又躲过一劫\N
	Another disaster avoided.
	我的生活简直到处埋着地雷\N
	My life had become a minefield.
	- 嘿 兄弟 - 嘿\N
	- Hey, man. - hey.
	这是什么\N
	What's this?
	哇哦\N
	Whoa.
	不是你想的那样\N
	It's not what you think.
	好吧 就是你想的那样 让我解释一下\N
	Okay, it is what you think, but i can explain.
	好吧 我没法解释 我们能待会儿再说吗\N
	Okay, i can't explain. can we just talk about it later?
	随便你\N
	Whatever you say.
	我得和什么人倾诉一下\N
	I had to talk to someone.
	加雷特怎么样 也许他能帮我回归正轨\N
	Why not garrett? Maybe he could help me get back on track.
	加雷特对心理问题非常了解\N
	Garrett was surprisingly sensitive in matters of the heart.
	你疯了吗 那可是朱莉 贝克 你讨厌她\N
	Are you freaking mental? Juli Baker. you hate her.
	所以才奇怪啊 我不觉得她讨厌了\N
	That's what's weird. i don't think I do.
	我没法不想着她\N
	I can't stop thinking about her.
	- 你这样很糟糕 兄弟 - 那我该怎么办\N
	- You got it bad, man. - Well, what do I do
	你得把它扼杀在摇篮里\N
	Well, you gotta nip this in the bud.
	这算不上是真的感情\N
	These aren't real emotions.
	- 不是吗 - 你只是因为鸡蛋的事觉得愧疚\N
	- They're not? - You feel guilty because of the egg thing.
	是啊 我还嘲笑了她家的院子\N
	Yeah, and i insulted her yard.
	就是啊 反正那地方的确很糟糕\N
	Exactly. of course, the place is a dump anyways.
	又不能怪她父亲把所有的钱\N
	It was not her fault. Her dad's got a retarded brother and
	都花在智障弟弟的身上\N
	all their money goes to helping him.
	一个智障 那你就更能明白一些事了\N
	A retard? Well, shoot, that ought to tell you something.
	- 明白什么事 - 朱莉的事\N
	- About what? - About Juli.
	什么意思\N
	What are you saying?
	有其叔 必有其侄呗 朋友\N
	The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. My friend.
	我简直不敢相信 我想大声呵斥他\N
	I couldn't believe it. I wanted to yell at him.
	告诉他 他并不像我一样了解朱莉\N
	Tell him that he didn't know Juli like i did.
	但我只是这样说 对哦\N
	But all that came out was: Heh, oh.
	- 没错 - 是吧\N
	- right. - yeah.
	没错 我一会儿再和你说\N
	Right. um, I'll talk to you later.
	放学后我本该去找加雷特的\N
	I was supposed to go to garrett's after school...
	但我不能见到他\N
	...but i couldn't be around him.
	他太过分了\N
	He'd crossed the line.
	而和他在同一战线的\N
	And standing right next to him
	还有我爸爸\N
	across that line was my father.
	我不在乎他们怎么想\N
	I didn't care what they thought.
	我喜欢朱莉 贝克\N
	I liked Juli Baker.
	每个周日早晨 家里都很平静\N
	Sunday mornings are peaceful in our house.

	My dad lets himself sleep in.
	妈妈也松懈了做早餐\N
	My mother lets herself not fix breakfast.
	如果不是哥哥们很早就出去找乐队的人\N
	If my brothers have been out late playing with their band...
	中午之前你都感觉不到他们的存在\N
	...you won't even know they're around till noon.
	但这个周日 我起床时有种奇怪的感觉\N
	But this sunday, i woke up feeling weird.
	我得做点什么来摆脱\N
	I had to do something to shake off
	对布莱斯的矛盾心情\N
	the confused feelings about Bryce...
	那些感情又悄悄地回到我心里了\N
	...that were starting to creep back in.
	你真的把院子打理好了\N
	You really did it, didn't you heh.

	更能让我们的心连在一起\N

	poles with a neutral conductor.
	永动机\N
	Perpetual motion?
	我站在这儿 心如死灰\N
	Here i was, dying inside, and they
	他们居然在谈论永动机\N
	were talking about Perpetual motion.
	朱莉是怎么知道这些的\N
	And how did Juli know about all that stuff?
	好了 大家伙 晚餐准备好了 琳内特\N
	Come on, everybody, dinner's ready. Lynnette!
	吃饭啦\N
	Dinner!
	朱莉 我能跟你聊聊吗\N
	Juli, can i talk to you?
	加勒特说的不对 我知道\N
	It was wrong, what garrett said. i know it.
	他在说的时候你知道是错的吗\N
	Did you know it was wrong when he said it?
	是的 我本想打他来着\N
	Yeah. i wanted to punch him.
	但我们当时在图书馆\N
	But we were in the library.
	所以你就赞同他 和他一起笑了吗\N
	So instead you just agreed with him and laughed.
	是的\N
	Yeah.
	那说明你就是个懦夫\N
	Then that makes you a coward.
	整顿饭我都坐在朱莉对面\N
	I had to sit across from Juli for an entire dinner.
	我爸爸说的对\N
	My dad was right.
	我们应该吃烧烤\N
	We should have barbecued.
	我想说能和你们\N
	I just want to say how wonderful it

	也许这是一个开始\N
	May it be the first of many.

	Wrong pipe.
	嗯 我们也很开心\N
	Well, we couldn't be happier.
	我们非常激动能来这儿做客\N
	We are just all so thrilled to be here.
	朱莉 你把你家院子收拾的很不错啊\N
	Juli, you did a really nice job on your yard.
	谢谢 切特帮了大忙\N
	Thanks. Chet was a big help.
	是啊 我知道\N
	Yeah, i know.
	你得告诉我秘诀\N
	You gotta tell me your secret. i can't
	我都请不动老爷子干活\N
	get him to do a thing around here.
	- 史蒂文 - 我开玩笑啦\N
	- steven. - i kid.
	我告诉你们 我们社区真的开始活跃起来了\N
	I'm telling you, the neighborhood is really coming to life.
	我是说 那栋新房子马上完工\N
	I mean, that new house is taking shape.
	哪栋\N
	Which one?
	你知道 就是他们砍掉那棵大丑树的地方\N
	You know, the one where they cut down that big ugly tree.
	我想说很多人都\N
	I wanted to say that a lot of people
	喜欢那棵树\N
	liked that tree.
	但我没说 我不想和我爸作对\N
	But I didn't,I didn't want to go against my dad.
	有些人将那棵树视为\N
	Some people thought that tree was
	这个社区的珍宝\N
	the jewel of the neighborhood.
	是啊 嗯 人各有喜好\N
	Yeah, well, there's no accounting for taste.
	马特 马克 马克 马特\N
	So, matt, mark, mark, matt...
	你们俩 马上就要毕业了是不是\N
	You guys are, uh, gonna be graduating soon, huh?
	是啊 总算是\N
	Yeah, thank god.
	你们不喜欢高中吗\N
	You don't like high school?
	- 你开玩笑吗 - 没有\N
	- You kidding? - No.
	高中生活是我人生最美好的时光\N
	High school was the best time of my life.
	- 对我们来说不是 - 是啊 我们已经受够了\N
	- not for us, no. - yeah, we've had enough of that scene.
	啊\N
	Ah.
	那上大学肯定是没希望了\N
	so college school probably out of the question，huh?
	不是 有可能念啊\N
	No, it's a possibility.
	事实上他们已经被\N
	They've actually been accepted...
	- 好几所大学录取了 - 是的\N
	- at several places already. - yes, they have.
	真的吗\N
	Really?
	那太好了\N
	Well, that's good.
	但 我们准备先玩段时间音乐\N
	But, um, we're gonna give music a shot first.
	- 是吗 - 哦 他们真的很有天赋\N
	- really? - oh, they are very talented.
	哦 他们的乐队很棒\N
	Oh, their band is really boss.
	他们制作了一堆录音样带 真的很好听\N

	当我和史蒂文刚认识的时候 他也在一个乐队演奏\N
	When Steven and i first met, he was playing in a band.
	你在乐队里演奏过吗\N
	You played in a band?
	他是一个很棒的萨克斯演奏者\N
	He was a wonderful saxophone player.
	- 酷 你现在还演奏吗 - 嗯\N
	- cool. you still play? - well, l...
	如果你想的话 你可以抽时间过来一起玩\N
	Well, if you want, .
	呃 你们\N
	Uh, you...
	不 我是说\N
	No, i mean... heh.
	我很久都不吹了\N
	That's not me anymore.
	你们俩有没有在观众面前表演过\N
	Have you boys ever performed in front of an audience?
	很多次了\N
	A lot of times.
	马特和马克谈论\N
	The more matt and mark talked
	他们的音乐造诣越多\N
	about their musical exploits.
	我爸爸就越沉默\N
	...the quieter my dad got.
	他不时地努力挤出一个假笑\N
	He tried to plaster on a smile now and then...
	但在心里他看起来很悲伤\N
	...but underneath he seemed really sad.
	但我爸妈一开始就不喜欢他\N
	But my parents didn't like him at first.
	共和党派极力的反对这项新决议\N
	Republicans fought like crazy against the new deal.
	晚餐剩下的时间都过的不痛不痒\N
	The rest of the evening was painless enough.
	但整顿饭下来 朱莉没再跟我说一句话\N
	But through it all, Juli didn't say a word to me.
	连看都不看我一眼\N
	Never even looked at me.
	直到她要回去了\N
	Until she was about to leave.
	对不起刚进来的时候对你说话很冲\N
	I'm sorry i was so angry when we first came in.
	我觉得大家都度过了美好的时光\N
	I think everyone had a good time.
	你妈妈真的很好 邀请我们做客\N
	Your mom was really nice to invite us.
	回头见\N
	See you.
	她的道歉让事情更僵硬\N
	Her apology made things worse.
	— 嘿 等下我 - 我知道我没有被原谅\N
	- hey wait for me. - I knew i wasn't forgiven.
	就像是我根本就不重要\N
	It was like i wasn't even important
	不值得她生气一样\N
	enough to hold a grudge against.
	嗯 我觉得他们一家都很讨人喜欢\N
	Well, i think they're a delightful family.
	男孩子们跟我想的完全不一样\N
	Those boys were nothing like i expected.
	我觉得他们都很优秀\N
	I thought they were very nice young men.
	- 小兔崽子 - 什么\N
	- hoodlums. - what?
	你觉得他们买得起录音设备吗\N
	How you think they can afford all that recording gear?
	史蒂文 拜托 你别信口开河 胡说八道\N
	Steven, please. you can't just make an accusation like that.
	别那么单纯 缺心眼子\N
	Don't be so naive, patsy.
	你知道录样带有多贵吗\N
	Do you know how expensive it is to record a demo?
	他们可能偷了轮毂 为了凑钱\N
	They're probably stealing hubcaps, for chris sake.
	你真是个大混蛋\N
	You are such an asshole.
	你到底怎么回事啊\N
	What is the matter with you?
	去死吧\N
	Go to hell.
	不准这么跟我说话\N
	Don't you talk to me like that.
	史蒂文 站住\N
	Steven, stop!
	没人能在我家那么跟我说话\N
	Nobody talks to me like that in my house
	回来\N
	Stop!
	我见过我爸爸生气的样子 这次不一样\N
	I'd seen my father angry before, but this was different.
	那晚当我躺在床上\N
	As i lay in bed that night...
	我在想我爸爸为什么\N
	...i thought about how my dad
	总是瞧不起贝克一家人\N
	always looked down Bakers
	总是叫他们废物\N
	And how he'd called them trash and
	取笑贝克先生的画\N
	made fun of mr. Baker's paintings.
	现在我意识到他只是在跟自己生气\N
	And now i realized he was just mad at himself.
	但为什么呢\N
	But why?
	朱莉说我是懦夫\N
	Juli called me a coward.
	难道我爸爸也是一个懦夫\N
	Was it possible my dad was a coward too?
	我不知道\N
	I didn't know.
	这又有什么区别呢\N
	What difference did it make?
	朱莉 贝克从我的生活中消失了\N
	Juli Baker was out of my life.
	或者是 更准确地说\N
	Or, more accurately...
	我从她的生活中消失了\N
	...i was out of hers.
	在我为去洛斯奇家做客换衣服时\N
	As i was getting dressed for the Loskis' dinner party...
	我发现自己一直盯着\N
	...i found myself staring at the
	我父亲送给我的画\N
	painting my father gave me.
	又开始一肚子怨气\N
	...and became furious all over again.
	布莱斯从没都没把我当过朋友\N
	Bryce had never been a friend to me, ever.
	他没有跟我一起保护那棵树\N
	He hadn't taken my side about the tree...
	他扔掉了我给的鸡蛋\N
	...he'd thrown away my eggs...
	他还取笑我的叔叔\N
	...and he made fun of me at my uncle's expense.
	当我妈妈叫我出发时\N
	When my mother called that it was time to go...
	朱莉 快点 我们迟了\N
	Juli, let's go, we're late!
	我想了千百个理由想告诉她\N
	I went out with every intention of telling
	我不想去洛斯奇家吃晚饭\N
	her that i wasn't going to the Loskis' home for dinner
	拿下这个 我需要再快速\N
	Please hold these. i need to check my
	检查下我的头发\N
	hair really quickly one more time.
	- 亲爱的 你的发型很完美了 - 真的吗\N
	- honey,your hair is perfect. - really?
	但她看起来很开心\N
	But she looked so happy...
	她为做那些派\N
	...and she'd gone to so much trouble
	花了很多心思 我不能\N
	over the pies.I could't
	哦 哦 我的天啊 哦 天啊 差点毁了\N
	Ooh! oh, my gosh. oh, god, what a disaster.
	好了 你拿着一个 你拿着这个\N
	Okay. here, hold one, and you hold this.
	- 我不想拿 - 我不会让你拿的\N
	- i don't wanna hold it. - i won't have you hold it.
	走吧 孩子们\N
	Let's go, boys.
	但这并不意味我必须对布莱斯友善\N
	But that didn't mean i had to be nice to Bryce.
	我不想跟你说话\N
	And i don't wanna speak to you.
	现在不想 以后也不想\N
	Not now, not ever.
	有主动权的感觉很好\N
	It felt good to take charge.
	我觉得自己能掌控一切 我告诉布莱斯我的想法\N
	I felt strong, in control. i told Bryce what i thought...
	我打算晚上不再\N
	...and i was determined not to talk
	跟他说话\N
	to him for the rest of evening.
	吃饭的时候 我突然想到\N
	At dinner it struck me that we were
	我们在跟一群陌生人吃饭\N
	sharing a meal with a group of strangers.
	我们跟洛斯奇家做邻居好几年了\N
	We'd lived across the street from the Loskis for years...
	但除了切特 我根本不了解这些人\N
	...but except for chet, i didn't know these people at all.
	洛斯奇先生在外面看起来光鲜体面\N
	Mr. Loski was clean and smooth on the outside...
	但似乎看起来心里装着\N
	...but it seemed like there was something
	什么腐烂掉的东西\N
	rotten buried just beneath the surface.
	晚餐的最后 我感到很平静 就像旁观者\N
	By the end of the evening, all i felt was detached, neutral.
	没有争论 没有一点的愤怒\N
	No fireworks, no leftover anger...
	没有不安 什么都没有\N
	...no flutters, nothing.
	回头见\N
	See you.
	那晚我躺在床上感到很平静\N
	I went to bed that night feeling peaceful.
	- 你还好吗 - 嗯\N
	- you okay? - yeah.
	我很感激我有这样的家人\N
	I was grateful that i had the family i had.
	不用在乎布莱斯 洛斯基感觉很好\N
	And it felt good to no longer care about Bryce Loski.
	和贝克一家人的晚餐让我备受打击\N
	The dinner with the Bakers had taken its toll on me.
	然后学校一年一度的募捐活动来了\N
	Then the annual school fundraiser arrived...
	我发现自己又有了一堆新的烦恼\N
	...and i found myself with a whole new set of problems.
	我要做篮子男孩\N
	I was a basketboy.
	想要充分欣赏篮子男孩的耻辱盛况\N
	To fully appreciate the humiliation of being a basketboy...
	你需要知道的是 那些被选中的少数人\N
	... all you need to know that the chosen few are
	当着全校学生的面被拍卖给\N
	auctioned off in front of the whole student of body
	出价最高的女生\N
	...to the highest-bidding females.
	是的 从技术上讲 我们每个人要带\N
	Yes, technically, each of us comes
	午餐篮子\N
	with a lunch basket
	但我们还是不要自欺欺人了 这就是一个选美活动\N
	...but let's not kid ourselves. this was a beefcake parade.
	在这儿啊 我的偶像\N
	There he is, my idol.
	再说一句 你就死定了\N
	One word, you're a dead man.
	不 伙计 我是认真的 听着 你肯定不相信这个\N
	No, man, i'm serious. listen, you won't believe this.
	什么\N
	What?
	两个最火辣的小妞正在因为你撕逼\N
	Two of the hottest chicks are fighting over you.
	你在说什么啊\N
	what are you talking about?
	雪莉和米奇分手了\N
	Sherry is breaking up with mitch
	她和梅勒妮打算在拍卖会上对你进行一场竞价战\N
	She and Melanie are having a bidding war over you.
	我不在乎\N
	I don't care.
	你傻了吗 雪莉踹了米奇是因为你\N
	Are you nuts? Sherry dumped mitch because of you.
	你就是我的偶像\N
	You're my idol.
	虽然成为加勒特偶像获得了点安慰\N
	As comforting as it was to be garrett's idol...
	这并没有减少我对做\N
	...it didn't diminish the horror
	第9号篮子男孩的恐惧\N
	of being a basketboy NO.9.
	我只希望在学校举行拍卖会之前\N
	And my only hope was that a giant tornado
	能被一场大飓风夷为平地\N
	would destroy the school before the big event.
	几乎没可能\N
	It was a long shot.
	欢迎 大家\N
	Welcome, everyone...

	I tried to go to bed early that night...
	但我睡不着\N
	...but i couldn't sleep.
	我从我家窗户 望着她家 好几个小时\N
	I watched her house from my window for hours.
	我必须想个办法 让她明白我的感觉\N

	满脑子都在想篮子男孩拍卖会\N
	obsessing about the Basketboy auction.
	我感觉得到 自己又开始想布莱斯了\N
	I could feel myself backsliding about Bryce.
	就算雪莉喜欢他 我为什么要在乎\N
	But why should i care if Sherry liked him?
	我根本不应该想他\N
	I shouldn't even be thinking about him.
	我必须忘记他\N
	I had to rise above this.
	布莱斯 洛斯基已经走出我的人生了\N
	Bryce Loski was no longer in my life.
	拍卖会的早上 我快奔溃了\N

	而且我也不会竞标 我已经不喜欢他了\N
	And i'm not bidding, okay? i don't even like him anymore.
	少来了\N
	Oh, that'll be the day.
	是真的 你请吧 把钱浪费在他身上 我不在乎\N

	现在让我们热烈欢迎\N

	1963年的篮子男孩\N
	...to your 1963 basketboys.
	我可以说我什么都不在乎\N
	I could say I didn't care all I wanted...
	但是看到布莱斯 西装革履的走出来\N
	...but seeing Bryce walk out in his jacket and tie...
	手里拎着他的餐篮\N
	...holding that picnic basket...
	我的头又开始晕眩了\N

	8元\N
	Eight dollars.
	茱莉贝克8元中标\N
	Sold to Juli Baker for $8.
	怎么会这样\N
	How did this happen?
	是因为 我同情艾迪吗\N
	Was it because i felt bad for Eddie?
	还是因为 我不相信我自己能忍住不去竞标布莱斯\N
	Or was it because i couldn't trust myself with Bryce?
	在去多媒体教室的路上\N
	As i made my way to the multi-purpose room...
	我思考着突变的事态\N
	...i contemplated the startling turn of events.
	我即将 和艾迪楚拉克 共进午餐\N

	很难弄 因为驾驶舱是凹进去的\N
	tricky because the cockpit was recessed
	我试着全神贯注在艾迪身上\N
	I tried to give Eddie my full attention.
	但 很难 因为布莱斯就在他身后\N
	But it was difficult, because Bryce was right behind him.
	艾迪在说什么进气阀\N
	Eddie was saying something about intake valves...
	布莱斯突然站起来了\N
	...when out of nowhere, Bryce stood
	并向我大步走了过来\N
	up and marched straight towards me.

	我不行\N

	布莱斯不肯放过我\N
	Bryce wouldn't leave me alone.
	他不断地打我家电话\N

	两天后 布莱斯停下来了\N
	After two days, Bryce stopped.
	我以为终于结束了\N
	And i thought it was finally over.
	然后 一天下午\N
	Then, one afternoon, I was coming
	我去前厅看书\N
	into the front room to read
	却听到院子里传来噪音\N
	...when i heard a noise in the yard.
	他在干嘛\N
	Hey, what's he doing?
	茱莉 冷静点 我允许他的\N
	Juli, calm down. I gave him permission.
	允许 允许什么 他在挖洞诶\N
	Permission? permission for what? he's digging a hole.
	我告诉他可以的\N
	I told him he could.
	为什么\N
	But why?
	我告诉他可以挖的\N
	I told him he could.
	看着他挖我的草地 真的是一种折磨\N
	It was torture seeing him dig up my grass.
	我爸为什么会允许他做这个\N
	How could my father let him do this?
	布莱斯知道我也在家\N
	Bryce knew i was there too.
	他走了\N
	He's gone.
	一棵树\N
	A tree?
	他要种一棵树\N
	He's planting a tree?
	那是\N
	Is it a?
	我根本不需要问\N
	I didn't really need to ask.
	我从树叶的形状和\N
	I could tell from the shape of the leaves...
	树干的质地就能分辨\N
	...and the texture of the trunk.
	那是无花果树\N
	It was a sycamore tree.
	当她从走出大门 我回想起\N
	When she walked out of the door, I thought
	第一次见到她\N
	back to the first time I saw her
	怎么会有人\N
	How could anybody, ever, have
	想要逃离 茱莉贝克呢\N
	wanted to run away from Juli Baker?
	他用那双眼睛看着我\N
	He looked at me with those eyes.
	那双再次发光的双眼\N
	Those once again dazzling eyes.
	我知道 我的初吻\N
	And I knew that Bryce Loski was still
	还会留给布莱斯 洛斯基\N
	walking around with my first kiss
	但不会太久的\N
	But he wouldn't be for long.
	我们站在那里 我才发现 这么多年来\N
	As we stood there, I realized that all these years...
	我们从来没有真的聊过\N
	...we never really talked.
	你需要帮忙吗\N
	Do you need some help?
	好呀\N
	Yeah.
	但是那一天 我们开始聊天了\N
	But that day, we started.
	我知道我们会聊很久的\N

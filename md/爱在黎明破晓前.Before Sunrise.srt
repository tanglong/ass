1
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:54,783
你知道他们在争论什么吗?
Do you have any idea what they were arguing about?

2
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,418
你会说英语吗?
Do you speak English?

3
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:58,517
会
Yeah.

4
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:01,451
不过抱歉,我的德语不太好
No. I'm sorry, my German is not very good.

5
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:08,362
你听说过年龄会导致夫妻间
Have you heard that as couples age...

6
00:04:08,362 --> 00:04:11,032
失去互相倾听的能力吗?
...they lose their ability to hear each other?

7
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:12,223
没有
No.

8
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:16,971
理论上男人会丧失听高音的能力...
Supposedly, men lose their ability to hear high-pitched sounds...

9
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,164
...而女人会丧失低音听力
...and women lose hearing in the low end.

10
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:21,974
这是一种相互抵制
I guess they nullify each other.

11
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,341
我想是的,自然法则是让夫妻白头偕老...
I guess. Nature's way of allowing couples to grow old together...

12
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:27,413
...而不是互相残杀
...without killing each other.

13
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:30,917
你在看什么书?
What are you reading?

14
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:33,285
哦，恩。
Oh, yeah.

15
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,322
你呢?
How about you?

16
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:56,234
我打算去休息室
I was thinking about going to the lounge car.

17
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:59,480
-你愿意和我一起去吗?
-Would you like to come with me? -Yeah.

18
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,680
-好的
Okay.

19
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:23,195
你的英语怎么说得这么好?
How do you speak such good English?

20
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,068
我在洛杉矶上过一个暑期班
I went to school for a summer in Los Angeles.

21
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:28,839
-坐这好吗? -好的
-It's fine here? -Yeah, this is good.

22
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,013
我还在伦敦呆过一段时间
And I spent some time in London.

23
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:35,980
那你的英语怎么说得这样好呢?
-Wow. -How do you speak such good English?

24
00:05:36,185 --> 00:05:37,846
我?我是美国人
Me? I'm American.

25
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:41,123
-你是美国人?你肯定? -当然
-You're American? Are you sure? -Yeah.

26
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:45,351
开个玩笑,我早知道你是美国人
No, I'm joking. I knew you were American.

27
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,189
而且你不会说任何其他语言,是吗?
And you don't speak any other language, right?

28
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:50,662
是的,是的,我知道你的意思
Yeah, yeah. I get it, I get it.

29
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:53,062
我是拙劣,弱智,粗俗的美国人...
I'm the crude, dumb, vulgar American...

30
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:58,002
...不会说其他语言,没有自己的文化, 但我尝试过
...who doesn't speak other languages, who has no culture. But I tried.

31
00:05:58,207 --> 00:06:01,836
我在高中学过法语, 我第一次去巴黎...
I took French in high school. When I first got to Paris...

32
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:04,410
...在地铁站排队时
...I stood in line at the metro station.

33
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,808
一直练习--(法语)
I was practicing.

34
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:11,544
不管是什么
Whatever.

35
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:18,251
轮到我时,我看着那个售票员...
And I get up there, and I look at this woman...

36
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:23,398
...脑子一片空白,然后我说 "我要一张票去..."
...and my mind goes blank. And I say, "I need a ticket to get to...."

37
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:25,066
话说回来...
So anyway....

38
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,297
你是去哪?
So where are you headed?

39
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:30,568
回巴黎
Well, back to Paris.

40
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:34,072
-我下周就要开学了 -你还在上学?什么学校?
-My classes start next week. -You're still in school? Where?

41
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,368
巴黎大学,听说过吗?
La Sorbonne. You know?

42
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:37,637
当然
Sure.

43
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,173
你从布达佩斯来?
You're coming from Budapest?

44
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:44,410
-我去看过我的祖母 -她人好吗?
-I was visiting my grandmother. -Oh. How is she?

45
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,145
挺好的
She's okay.

46
00:06:47,356 --> 00:06:49,517
-身体还好吧? -还不错
-She's all right? -She's fine.

47
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:53,858
-你呢?你去哪? -我去维也纳
-How about you? Where are you going? -I'm going to vienna.

48
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:55,189
维也纳?那里怎么样?
vienna? What's there?

49
00:06:55,398 --> 00:06:57,593
不知道,我明天就会离开
No idea. I'm flying out of there tomorrow.

50
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,358
你在渡假?
You're on holiday?

51
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:05,931
要知道我也不清楚这算不算渡假
I don't really know what I'm on. You know?

52
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:10,440
我只是四处旅行,坐了两三个星期的火车
I've just been traveling around, riding trains for two or three weeks.

53
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:13,547
是去拜访朋友还是纯粹的旅行?
You were visiting friends or just on your own?

54
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:16,274
我有个朋友在马德里,不过...
I had a friend in Madrid, but....

55
00:07:16,485 --> 00:07:19,010
-马德里,那儿很漂亮 -我有张全欧火车优惠票...
-Madrid, that's nice. -I got a Eurail pass...

56
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:20,313
...就是这样
...is what I did.

57
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,649
不错的理由
hat's great.

58
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:26,427
那这次环欧旅行对你有帮助吗?
So has this trip around Europe been good for you?

59
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:29,530
是的,当然,它...它很有快感
Yeah, sure. It's been.... It sucked.

60
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,427
什么?
What?

61
00:07:33,502 --> 00:07:34,526
它有它的...
It's had its....

62
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:38,373
这么说吧,坐上几个礼拜来看窗外的景色...
I'll tell you, sitting for weeks on end looking out the window...

63
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:40,838
...感觉的确很不错
...has actually been kind of great.

64
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:43,869
你是指什么?
What do you mean?

65
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:46,815
你知道的,比如说...
Well, you know, for instance...

66
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:50,452
...会想到一些平时想不到的想法
...you have ideas that you ordinarily wouldn't have.

67
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:52,678
-什么想法? -想听一个吗?
-What kind of ideas? -Want to hear one?

68
00:07:52,888 --> 00:07:54,879
-说说看 -好的
-Tell me. -All right.

69
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:58,026
我有这个想法是因为一个电视节目
I have this idea, okay, for a television show.

70
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,923
我有个朋友是"享受电视"栏目的制作人
Some friends of mine are cable-access producers.

71
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,722
知道它的运作方式吗?
Do you know what that is?

72
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,966
他们播放任何人制作的低成本节目
Anybody can produce a show real cheap, and they have to put it on.

73
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,334
我的想法是 让一个节目24小时播放并持续一年
I have this idea for a show that lasts 24 hours a day for a year straight.

74
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,769
你要做的就是找到...
What you do is you get...

75
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:18,310
...来自世界各地不同城市的365个人...
...365 people from cities all over the world...

76
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:21,506
...为每个人拍一部24小时的生活纪录片
...to do these 24-hour documents of real time.

77
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:24,311
捕捉真实的生活画面
Capturing life as it's lived.

78
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,479
知道吗,可以从一个人早上起床开始...
You know, it would start with a guy waking up in the morning...

79
00:08:28,691 --> 00:08:30,716
...舒舒服服洗个澡...
...and taking the long shower...

80
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:34,657
...吃点早餐,喝点咖啡...
...eating a little breakfast, making a little coffee...

81
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:35,990
...看看报纸...
...reading the paper....

82
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:38,257
等一下,全都是大家见鬼的生活中
Wait. All those mundane, boring things...

83
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:41,493
每天那些平淡无聊的琐事吗?
...everybody has to do every day of their fucking life?

84
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:43,797
是"诗意的日复一日的生活"
I was going to say, "The poetry of day-to-day life."

85
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:46,497
你有你的说法,我有我的说法
You say it your way. I'll say it my way.

86
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:48,700
-可以这样想-- -有谁会看呢?
-Think of it like this-- -Who's gonna watch?

87
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:53,041
可以这样想,一只狗在太阳底下睡觉...
Think about it like this. Why is it that a dog sleeping in the sun...

88
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,907
...画面很美是不是?是的,确实很美
...is so beautiful? It is. It's beautiful.

89
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,712
但一个人从提款机取钱...
But a guy taking money from a bank machine...

90
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,946
...为什么就显得无聊了呢?
...looks like a complete moron?

91
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:05,355
这就象国家地理杂志的节目,只不过拍的是人
So it's like a National GEographic program, but on people.

92
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:06,391
正是
Yeah.

93
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,428
觉得怎么样?
What do you think?

94
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,499
是的,我明白, 就象,"无聊24小时"--对不起--
Yeah, I can see it. Like, 24 boring hours-- Sorry--

95
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:16,159
...在一段3分钟的性交场面之后主角就睡着了
...and a three-minute sex scene where he falls asleep right after.

96
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:20,407
对啊,那会是一段很不错的情节
Yeah, and that would be a great episode.

97
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:23,009
人们会谈论这段情节
People would talk about that episode.

98
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,080
如果愿意的话你可以和朋友在巴黎拍上一集
You and your friends could do one in Paris if you wanted.

99
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:32,084
我不知道,关键是地理分布问题让我头疼
I don't know. The key, the thing that haunts me is the distribution.

100
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:36,224
要一个城镇接一个城镇地拍摄 以保证它的持续性
Getting these tapes from town to town so it would play continuously.

101
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:41,089
因为它必须不停地播放,否则就没有意义了
Because it would have to play all the time, or it just wouldn't work.

102
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:43,262
谢谢
Thank you.

103
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,892
谢谢
Thanks.

104
00:09:47,636 --> 00:09:50,571
知道吗?没有"服务指南"
You know what? Not service oriented.

105
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:54,540
只是一份"欧洲观察"
Just an observation about Europe.

106
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:05,751
我父母从没真正谈论过
My parents never really spoke of the possibility...

107
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:09,516
我会恋爱结婚生孩子的可能性
...of my falling in love or getting married or having children.

108
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:11,857
甚至我还是小女孩时...
Even as a little girl...

109
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:15,519
...他们就要我考虑未来的职业,例如...
...they wanted me to think as a future career as a, you know...

110
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:18,928
...室内设计,律师或诸如此类
...interior designer or lawyer or something like that.

111
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:21,933
我对我爸爸说我想以写作为业
I'd say to my dad, "l want to be a writer."

112
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:23,867
他就说做记者
And he'd say, "Journalist."

113
00:10:24,073 --> 00:10:28,601
我说想开个流浪猫收容所,他就说做兽医
I'd say I wanted to have a refuge for stray cats. He'd say, "veterinarian."

114
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:32,440
我说想做演艺工作,他就说做电视播音员
I'd say I wanted to be an actress. He'd say, "TV newscaster."

115
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:36,641
这使得我的理想抱负慢慢转变成了...
It was this constant conversion of my fanciful ambition into these...

116
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:39,184
...现实的赚钱手段
...practical moneymaking ventures.

117
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,018
我很小时就善于洞察谎言
I had a good bullshit detector when I was a kid.

118
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,717
当别人说谎时我总是能知道
I always knew when they were lying to me.

119
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:48,954
到了高中,我决定...
By high school, I was dead set...

120
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:53,363
...听听大家认为我这辈子该做什么...
...on listening to what everybody thought I should do with my life...

121
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,366
...然后反其道而行之
...and doing the opposite.

122
00:10:56,472 --> 00:11:01,136
没有谁会当真, 我只是不喜欢
Nobody was ever mean about it. I just could never get very excited...

123
00:11:01,343 --> 00:11:04,506
别人将想法强加在我头上
...about other people's ambitions for my life.

124
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,744
但你知道吗?如果父母从不...
But you know what? If your parents never...

125
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,613
...在任何事上完全否定你, 而是友好地给予支持...
...fully contradict you about anything and are nice and supportive...

126
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,809
嗯。
Right.

127
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:16,119
...那会让你很难抱怨
...it makes it even harder to officially complain.

128
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:20,193
哪怕他们做得并不对, 这是一种被动攻击
Even when they're wrong, it's this passive-aggressive shit.

129
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:21,795
你明白吗?
You know what I mean?

130
00:11:21,997 --> 00:11:23,259
我讨厌这样
I hate it.

131
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,258
非常反感
I really hate it.

132
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:29,267
知道吗,尽管这种种不快...
Well, you know, despite all that kind of bullshit...

133
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,132
...总是会随之而来
...that comes along with it...

134
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:34,505
...但我记得童年就象...
...I remember childhood as...

135
00:11:35,377 --> 00:11:37,402
...一段魔幻时光
...this magical time.

136
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:42,550
真的, 记得我妈妈第一次跟我说到死亡
I do. I remember when my mother first told me about death.

137
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:47,517
我的曾祖母去世,我们全家去弗罗里达奔丧
My great-grandmother had died, and my family had visited them in Florida.

138
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:49,782
当时我才3岁或3岁半
I was about 3, 3 1/2 years old.

139
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,426
我在后院玩耍时...
Anyway, I was in the back yard playing...

140
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:57,224
...姐姐教我怎样拿浇花的水管...
...and my sister had just taught me how to take the garden hose...

141
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:59,594
...就是象这样子捏着...
...and do it in such a way that...

142
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:03,564
...喷出的水雾会在阳光下形成一道彩虹
...it sprayed into the sun and would make a rainbow.

143
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:06,939
于是我那样做...
And so I was doing that...

144
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:10,304
...透过水雾,我看到了曾祖母
...and through the mist, I could see my grandmother.

145
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:13,811
她就站在那,冲着我微笑
And she was just standing there, smiling at me.

146
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:17,179
我愣在那很长时间
And I held it there for a long time...

147
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:19,183
...并且看着她
...and I looked at her.

148
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:22,653
最终我松开了喷嘴
And then finally, I let go of the nozzle, you know?

149
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:24,826
然后扔下水管...
And then I dropped the hose...

150
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:26,754
...她就消失了
...and she disappeared.

151
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,325
于是我跑回屋里告诉父母
And so I run back inside and tell my parents.

152
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:35,035
他们让我坐下,然后训斥了我一顿...
And they sit me down and give me this big rap on how...

153
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:40,331
...人死了之后你绝不可能再见到他们, 那只是我的幻觉
...when people die, you never see them again, and how I'd imagined it.

154
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:43,067
但我知道我看到了什么,并且为之高兴
But I knew what I'd seen. I was glad I saw that.

155
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,238
我以后绝不会再看到类似的情景, 但我不知道
I've never seen anything like that since. But I don't know.

156
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:51,510
那让我有点明白世事都是那么无法解释
It just kind of let me know how ambiguous everything was.

157
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,153
包括死亡
Even death.

158
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,821
你该庆幸你能这样看待死亡
You're lucky you can have this attitude toward death.

159
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:02,693
我想我时刻都在害怕死亡
I think I'm afraid of death 24 hours a day.

160
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:06,334
真的,所以我才会坐火车
I swear. I mean, that's why I'm in a train right now.

161
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,197
我可以乘飞机去巴黎,但我害怕
I could've flown to Paris, but I'm scared.

162
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:11,703
-不会吧 -我控制不了
-Oh, come on. -I can't help it.

163
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:15,308
我知道统计显示"不,不,不,它很安全"
I know the statistics say, "Na, na, na, it's safer." Whatever.

164
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:18,639
但我乘飞机时就会看到爆炸
When I'm in a plane, I can see the explosion.

165
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:21,145
我看到我从云端坠落
I can see me falling through the clouds.

166
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,616
我非常害怕那几秒钟的意识...
And I'm so scared of those few seconds of consciousness...

167
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:29,223
...在临死之前, 你知道自己快要死了的时候
...before you die. When you know you're gonna die.

168
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:34,426
我总忍不住会这样想
I can't stop thinking that way.

169
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,063
那让人筋疲力竭
It's exhausting.

170
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:37,823
是的,没错
Yeah, I bet.

171
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:39,830
真的筋疲力竭
Really exhausting.

172
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:46,206
-我想这是维也纳了 -是的
-I think this is vienna. -Yeah.

173
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,242
-你在这下,是吗? -是的,真扫兴
-You get off here, no? -Yeah, what a drag.

174
00:13:50,713 --> 00:13:54,149
早认识你就好了,我很喜欢和你聊天
I wish I'd met you earlier. I really like talking to you.

175
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:56,681
我也是
Yeah, me too.

176
00:13:57,453 --> 00:13:59,614
很高兴能认识你
It was really nice of you too.

177
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,719
我有个无疑是疯狂的想法, 但要是不问你的话...
I have an admittedly insane idea, but if I don't ask you this...

178
00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:36,948
...我下半辈子都会耿耿于怀的
...it'll haunt me the rest of my life.

179
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:37,887
是什么?
What?

180
00:14:41,163 --> 00:14:45,862
我想继续跟你聊天, 尽管我对你一无所知...
I want to keep talking to you. I have no idea what your situation is...

181
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:48,802
...但我觉得我们似乎...
...but I feel like we have some kind of...

182
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:50,437
似曾相识,同意吗?
...connection. Right?

183
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:51,798
是的,我同意
Yeah. Me too.

184
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:54,039
那就好,是这样
Right. Great. Here's the deal.

185
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:57,644
跟我一起下车游览维也纳
Get off here in vienna and come check out the town.

186
00:14:57,846 --> 00:14:59,507
-什么? -来吧,肯定很有意思
-What? -Come on. It'll be fun.

187
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:01,644
-来吧 -我们做些什么?
-Come on. -What would we do?

188
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,446
不知道,我只知道我的飞机是明早9:30
I don't know. All I know is I catch a flight tomorrow morning at 9:30...

189
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:10,022
...而且我没钱住旅馆了, 所以只好到处走走...
...and I can't afford a hotel, so I was going to walk around...

190
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:12,090
...如果你和我同行会更有意思
...and it'd be more fun if you came with me.

191
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:16,025
如果你觉得我不正常, 你可以改乘下一班火车
And if I turn out to be a psycho, just get on the next train.

192
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,463
好吧,好吧,设想一下
All right, all right. Think of it like this.

193
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:23,564
10年20年之后,懂吗?
Jump ahead 10, 20 years, okay?

194
00:15:23,772 --> 00:15:24,932
你结婚之后
And you're married.

195
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,974
你的婚姻失去了曾经有过的活力
Only your marriage doesn't have that same energy it used to have.

196
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:31,174
你开始责备你的丈夫
You start to blame your husband.

197
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,315
你回想你一生中曾遇见过的所有男人...
You think about all those guys you've met in your life...

198
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:38,179
...设想嫁给他们中的一个会发生什么
...and what might've happened if you'd picked up with one of them.

199
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:40,378
我就是其中之一,就是我
I'm one of those guys. That's me.

200
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:42,454
就当这是个时空旅行...
So think of this as time travel...

201
00:15:42,658 --> 00:15:46,594
...来到现在,看看你当时错过了什么
...from then to now to find out what you're missing out on.

202
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:49,093
那会有极大的帮助,
What this could be is a gigantic favor...

203
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:52,927
你会发现并未错过任何东西
...to you and your husband to find out you're not missing anything.

204
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:56,127
我只是个和他一样的失败者, 缺乏目标,无所事事
I'm just as big a loser as he is. Unmotivated. Boring.

205
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:58,966
你做了正确的选择,为此而开心
You made the right choice. You're happy.

206
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,310
我去拿我的包
Let me get my bag.

207
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:36,107
我们该找个地方寄存行李
We should get a locker for all this.

208
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:42,343
你叫什么?
What's your name?

209
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:43,677
我吗?
My name?

210
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:47,413
杰西,实际上是詹姆斯, 但大家都叫我杰西
Jesse. James, actually, but everybody calls me Jesse.

211
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,784
那就是杰西-詹姆斯,对吗?
You mean, Jesse James, no?

212
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:51,289
不,就是杰西
No. No, just Jesse.

213
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:52,517
我叫塞琳娜
I'm Celine.

214
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:08,669
这座桥真漂亮
This is a nice bridge.

215
00:17:08,877 --> 00:17:10,139
是的
Yeah.

216
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:16,075
感觉怪怪的
This is kind of weird.

217
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,015
是吗?我觉得有点尴尬
Isn't it? I mean, I feel a little awkward.

218
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:23,020
-但没关系不是吗? -是的,这非常棒
-But it's all right. Right? -Yeah, this is great.

219
00:17:23,225 --> 00:17:26,991
-找些地方看看吧 -好的,我们找找看
-Let's go to some places. -Yeah, let's go to some places.

220
00:17:27,195 --> 00:17:28,685
-我去问问这些人 -好的
-Let's ask these guys. -Okay.

221
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:31,263
抱歉,打扰一下
Excuse me. Excuse me?

222
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:33,195
你们会说英语吗?
SprEchEn siE English?

223
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:36,860
-当然会 -能不能换成你说德语?
-Ja. Of course. -Do you speak German for a change?

224
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:38,869
-什么? -开个玩笑
-What? -No, it was a joke.

225
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:42,874
我们今天刚到维也纳, 想找些有意思的地方看看
We just got into vienna today, and we' re looking for something fun to do.

226
00:17:43,078 --> 00:17:44,807
例如博物馆,展览会...
Like museums, exhibitions....

227
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:48,449
但最近博物馆没什么意思
But museums are not that funny anymore these days.

228
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,950
他们马上就要关门了, 你们会在这逗留多久?
They are closing right now. How long are you going to be here?

229
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,349
就一个晚上
Just for tonight.

230
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:57,692
你们为什么来维也纳? 你们想看些什么?
Why did you come to vienna? What could you be expecting?

231
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:01,893
我们在渡蜜月
We' re on honeymoon.

232
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:05,189
是的,她怀孕了,我们不得不结婚...
Yeah, she got pregnant, we had to get married....

233
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,868
得了吧,你不懂撒谎
I don't believe you. You're a bad liar.

234
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,744
我们有场演出,很乐意邀请你们观看
This is a play we're both in. We would like to invite you.

235
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:19,243
你们是演员?
You're actors?

236
00:18:19,448 --> 00:18:21,643
不是专业的,只是业余爱好
Not professional. Part-time for fun.

237
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,978
是关于一头母牛和寻找它的印第安人
It's a play about a cow and lndians searching for it.

238
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,747
另外还有政客,墨西哥人--
There are also politicians, Mexicans--

239
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:29,890
俄罗斯人,共产主义者...
Russians, communists....

240
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:34,054
-用真正的母牛表演吗? -不,是由一个演员扮演
-You have a real cow on stage? -No, an actor in a cow costume.

241
00:18:34,262 --> 00:18:36,162
-他演母牛 -是的,我演母牛
-He's the cow. -Yes, I am the cow.

242
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,493
-但这头牛有点古怪 -它得了一种病
-And the cow's a bit weird. -The cow has a disease.

243
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,101
它的行为有点怪异,象只狗
She's acting a bit strange. Like a dog.

244
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:44,932
有人扔根棍子的话,它会去叼回来
If someone throws a stick, she fetches it.

245
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,371
还能用蹄子抽烟什么的
And she can smoke with hoofs and everything.

246
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,401
-真有意思 -看,这个就是地址
-Great. -As you see, there is the address.

247
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:53,342
在第二区
It's in the second district.

248
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:55,140
普拉特附近,知道是什么吗?
Near the Prater. You know it?

249
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,285
那个大摩天轮吗?我们会去的
The big Ferris wheel? We should go. We should.

250
00:18:58,487 --> 00:19:01,012
你们可以在开演之前先去普拉特
Perhaps you can go to the Prater before the play.

251
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,056
演出是21:30开始
It starts at 2130.

252
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:06,552
-21:30? -就是9:30
-2130? -It's at 9:30.

253
00:19:06,762 --> 00:19:08,787
-9:30 -好的
-9:30. -Oh, right.

254
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,725
这场戏叫什么?
What's the name of this play?

255
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:15,028
翻译过来就是"带给我威尔明顿的母牛角"
It translates as "Bring Me the Horns of Wilmington's Cow."

256
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,329
我就是威尔明顿的牛
I'm Wilmington's cow.

257
00:19:16,838 --> 00:19:18,305
-好的 -太棒了
-All right. -Great.

258
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:19,599
-你们会来吗? -尽量吧
-You'll be there? -We'll try.

259
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:21,605
我是母牛
I'm the cow.

260
00:19:21,843 --> 00:19:22,810
再见
Goodbye.

261
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:45,862
我有个主意,你准备好没有?
I got an idea. Are you ready?

262
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:48,730
是个问答游戏,我们已经互相有所了解
It's Q and A time. We've known each other a little while.

263
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,930
我们是同伴了, 所以可以相互问几个直接的问题
We're stuck together, so we'll ask each other a few direct questions.

264
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,266
行吗?
All right?

265
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:58,545
-我们互相提问? -但你必须老实回答
-We ask each other questions? -And you have to answer honestly.

266
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:00,510
-当然 -好的
-Of course. -Okay.

267
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:02,513
好的,第一个问题
All right, first question.

268
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:04,913
-你问 -是的,我要求你...
-You. -Yes, I am going to ask you.

269
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,851
向我描述你跟别人的...
Describe for me your first sexual feelings...

270
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:11,150
...第一次性经验。
...towards a person.

271
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:14,393
我第一次的感觉?我的天
My first sexual feelings? Oh, my God.

272
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:18,060
我知道,我知道
I know. I know.

273
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,262
让-马克-弗勒里
Jean-Marc Fleury.

274
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:22,663
让-马克-弗勒里?
Jean-Marc Fleury?

275
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,904
我们一起参加夏令营,他是个游泳运动员
We were at this summer camp together, and he was a swimmer.

276
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:30,511
有一头被氯漂白的头发和绿眼睛
He had bleached-out chlorine hair and green eyes...

277
00:20:30,712 --> 00:20:33,977
为了提高成绩他刮掉了腿上和手臂上的毛
...and to improve his times, he'd shave his legs and arms.

278
00:20:34,182 --> 00:20:37,618
-真恶心 -就象只光洁的海豚
-That's disgusting. -He was like this gorgeous dolphin.

279
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,049
我的朋友艾玛对他很着迷
My friend Emma had a big crush on him.

280
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:43,691
有一天,我穿过营地回我的房间
So one day, I was cutting across the field back to my room...

281
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:46,622
他走到我身边,我告诉他
...and he came walking up beside me. I told him...

282
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:50,229
"你该和艾玛约会,她对你很着迷"
..."You should date Emma. She has a big crush on you."

283
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:51,990
但他转过身对我说
And he turned to me and said...

284
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,068
"那太糟了,因为我对你很着迷"
..."Well, that's too bad, because I have a big crush on you."

285
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:59,434
是的,那真让我感到意外
So, yeah, it really scared the hell out of me...

286
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:01,836
...因为我觉得他太优秀
...because I thought he was so fine.

287
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:07,014
然后他正式向我提出约会,我假装不喜欢他
Then he officially asked me on a date. I pretended I didn't like him.

288
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:12,553
要知道我很害怕自己可能做的事
You know, I was so afraid of what I might do, you know.

289
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:17,658
我去看了几次他的游泳比赛
So I went to see him swim a few times at the competition.

290
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,885
他很性感,真的,我是说非常性感
And he was so sexy. Really. I mean, really sexy.

291
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:25,590
那个夏季末我们写下了一些爱的宣言
We wrote these little declarations of love at the end of the summer...

292
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:29,202
我们保证要一直通信
...and, you know, promised we would keep writing forever...

293
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:31,668
还有要尽快再见面
...and meet again very soon and--

294
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:32,931
见了吗?
Did you?

295
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:34,639
当然没有
Of course not.

296
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:39,706
我可以告诉你我是个非常棒的游泳选手
Then this is the opportune time to tell you I'm a fantastic swimmer.

297
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,512
-真的吗? -当然
-Really? -Yeah.

298
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,750
-我会记录下来 -没问题
-I make note of that. -Okay.

299
00:21:44,953 --> 00:21:47,421
-现在轮到我了吧? -是的,轮到你了
-So it's my turn. No? -Yes, your turn.

300
00:21:47,622 --> 00:21:48,850
问吧
Hit me.

301
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:52,556
你曾经恋爱过吗?
Have you ever been in love?

302
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:55,327
是的
Yes.

303
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,656
下一个问题
Next question.

304
00:21:57,365 --> 00:21:58,923
-是什么-- -等等
-What was the-- -Wait a minute.

305
00:21:59,134 --> 00:22:01,500
-一个字就算是回答? -怎么不算?
-So I can give one-word answers? -Why not?

306
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:04,570
我可是详细描述过我初次的性经验
After I went into detail about my sexual feelings?

307
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:09,233
因为问题不同,我可以回答性体验的事
They' re different questions. I could answer the sexual-feelings thing.

308
00:22:09,444 --> 00:22:13,141
但你要知道,爱-- 如果我问你是否恋爱过你会怎么回答?
But, you know, love-- I mean, what if I asked you about love?

309
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:17,114
我会说假话, 但我至少会编造一个美妙的故事
I would have lied, but at least I would have made up a great story.

310
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:19,913
爱是个复杂的问题,明白吗?
Love is a complex issue, you know?

311
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:24,854
我想是的, 我告诉过一些人我爱他们,而且我是认真的
I mean, yes, I've told somebody that I love them, and I've meant it.

312
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,291
但爱是完全无私的付出吗?
But was it totally unselfish, giving love?

313
00:22:28,496 --> 00:22:30,396
爱是一件美好的事吗?
Was it a beautiful thing?

314
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,659
不完全是,它就象,爱...
Not really. You know, it's like, love....

315
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,066
我想我无法说清
I mean, I don't know.

316
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:37,637
你明白吗?
You know?

317
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:42,402
-是的,我明白你的意思 -至于性体验...
-Yeah. I know what you mean. -But as far as sexual feelings go...

318
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,478
...是开始于一种迷恋性的关系...
...it started with an obsessive relationship...

319
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,706
...是和78年的7月小姐. 你知道"花花公子"杂志吗?
...with Miss July, 1978. Do you know Playboy magazine?

320
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:51,249
-听说过 -知道克里斯托吗?
-I've heard of it. -You know Crystal?

321
00:22:51,653 --> 00:22:54,178
你不知道克里斯托?哈,我认识她
You don't know Crystal? Well, I knew Crystal.

322
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:58,018
该轮到我了?
Is it my turn now?

323
00:22:58,393 --> 00:23:00,918
告诉我一件你特别生气的事
Tell me something that really pisses you off.

324
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,689
-让你气得发疯 -让我生气
-Really drives you crazy. -Pisses me off.

325
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:06,663
-老天,什么都让我生气 -列举一二
-God, everything pisses me off. -List a couple.

326
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:11,236
哦,我知道,我讨厌被陌生男人搭讪...
Oh, I know. I hate being told by strange men...

327
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:13,304
...街上的陌生男人...
...strange men in the street...

328
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:18,309
...你知道的, 笑脸让他们觉得生活不那么无聊
...you know, to smile to make them feel better about their boring life.

329
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,938
还有呢?
What else?

330
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,479
我讨厌
I hate....

331
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:25,175
我憎恨远在千里之外的战争
I hate that 300 kilometers from here, there's a war...

332
00:23:25,387 --> 00:23:27,582
...人们在死亡,但没人知道该怎么做
...people are dying, and nobody knows what to do.

333
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:30,087
也许根本不在乎,我说不清
Or they don't give a shit. I don't know.

334
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:33,921
我讨厌媒体试图控制我们的思想
I hate that the media's trying to control our minds.

335
00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:35,756
-媒体? -是的,媒体
-The media? -Yeah, the media.

336
00:23:35,964 --> 00:23:39,491
很难形容,是一种新的法西斯主义
It's very subtle, but it's a new form of fascism, really.

337
00:23:41,403 --> 00:23:42,529
我讨厌...
I hate....

338
00:23:43,438 --> 00:23:46,965
我讨厌身处异国,尤其是美国
I hate when I'm in a foreign country, especially in America...

339
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:51,737
...每当我穿黑衣服或是发脾气, 说不着边际的话...
...each time I wear black or lose my temper or say anything about anything...

340
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:55,212
...他们总是说, 哦,法国味十足,真有趣...
...they always go, "Oh, it's so French. It's so cute."

341
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:58,784
我讨厌这些,无法忍受,真的
I hate that. I can't stand that. Really.

342
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:00,912
就这些?
Is that all?

343
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,680
还有很多,不过...
Well, there's a lot of things, but....

344
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:06,360
-轮到我问了 -好的
-So it's my turn. -Okay.

345
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:08,891
-你得回答 -是的,我会回答
-You're gonna answer. -Yes, I'll answer.

346
00:24:09,097 --> 00:24:10,826
什么会让你困惑呢?
What's a problem for you?

347
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:12,864
也许就是你
You, probably.

348
00:24:13,134 --> 00:24:14,123
什么?
What?

349
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,869
有天我有过一个想法...
I had a thought the other day that kind of...

350
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:19,870
...那确实让我困惑
...qualifies as a problem.

351
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:21,199
是什么?
What is it?

352
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:24,378
是我在火车上想到的
It was a thought I had on the train, so....

353
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:26,240
这么说吧
Okay. All right.

354
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:28,312
你相信轮回转世吗?
Do you believe in reincarnation?

355
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,541
是的,那很有意思
Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting.

356
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:34,983
很多人都谈论前世这一类的话题
A lot of people talk about past lives and things like that, you know?

357
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,648
哪怕在特定的场合他们并不相信这一点...
And even if they don't believe in it in some specific way...

358
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,158
...人们相信灵魂是永存的
...people have a notion of an eternal soul.

359
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:42,261
-是的 -那好
-Yeah. -Okay.

360
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:44,955
我的想法是,5万年前
This is my thought: 50,000 years ago...

361
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:47,134
...人口还不足100万
...there's not even a million people.

362
00:24:47,335 --> 00:24:51,169
1万年前有大约200万人口
Ten thousand years ago, there's, like, two million people.

363
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:55,332
而现在世界上有50到60亿人口
Now there's between five and six billion people on the planet.

364
00:24:55,543 --> 00:24:57,067
如果我们都有属于自己的...
If we all have our own...

365
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:59,178
...独立的，特别的...
...individual, unique...

366
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:00,345
...灵魂...
...soul...

367
00:25:00,782 --> 00:25:02,579
...那他们是从何而来的呢?
...where did they all come from?

368
00:25:02,784 --> 00:25:06,379
现代人的灵魂只是原有灵魂的一部分吗?
Are modern souls only a fraction of the original souls?

369
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:10,581
如果是的话, 就表示每个灵魂在过去5万年...
If they are, that represents a 5000 to 1 split of each soul...

370
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:14,523
...分裂成了5000个, 对地球而言只是一瞬间
...in the last 50,000 years, which is a blip in the Earth's time.

371
00:25:14,729 --> 00:25:17,994
我们最多只是 人类史上...
So at best, we're these tiny fractions...

372
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:19,663
...微不足道的一部分
...of people walking--

373
00:25:19,868 --> 00:25:24,202
所以我们才这么分散? 所以我们才这么独特?
Is that why we're so scattered? Is that why we're so specialized?

374
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:25,964
等等,我不太--
Wait a minute, I'm not sure--

375
00:25:26,174 --> 00:25:29,632
是的,我知道, 这完全是不着边际的想法
Yeah, I know, I know. It's a totally scattered thought.

376
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:32,772
不过这样才有点意义
Which is kind of why it makes sense.

377
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:35,145
我同意
I agree with you.

378
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:38,284
我们还是下车吧
Let's get off this damn train.

379
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:15,683
这里很不错
This place is pretty neat.

380
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:16,879
是的
Yeah.

381
00:26:17,092 --> 00:26:19,424
还有个试听室呢
There's even a listening booth.

382
00:26:23,264 --> 00:26:25,494
听说过这个歌手吗?
Have you heard of this singer?

383
00:26:27,302 --> 00:26:29,566
是美国人,有个朋友跟我提起过
I think she's American. A friend told me about her.

384
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:33,104
想看看试听室是否还能用吗?
Do you want to go see if that listening booth still works?

385
00:26:33,308 --> 00:26:34,502
当然想
Yeah, okay.

386
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:16,809
~北面吹来一阵风
There's a wind that Blows in from the north

387
00:27:17,018 --> 00:27:21,853
~诉说着爱意的来临
And it says that loving Takes this course

388
00:27:22,357 --> 00:27:24,848
~来吧
Come here

389
00:27:27,162 --> 00:27:29,653
~来吧
Come here

390
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:35,866
~不,我并非不可亲近
No, I'm not impossible to touch

391
00:27:36,137 --> 00:27:40,938
~我从未如此需要过你
I have never wanted you so much

392
00:27:41,476 --> 00:27:44,070
~来吧
Come here

393
00:27:46,281 --> 00:27:48,112
~来吧
Come here

394
00:27:49,551 --> 00:27:54,488
~是否我从未躺在你身旁
Have I never laid down by your side

395
00:27:55,557 --> 00:28:00,358
~宝贝,让我们抛开矜持
Baby, let's forget about this pride

396
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:03,524
~来吧
Come here

397
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:08,696
~来吧
Come here

398
00:28:14,008 --> 00:28:16,408
看看这,太美了
Look at this. This is beautiful.

399
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,142
快,车要开了
Quick. It's leaving.

400
00:28:49,777 --> 00:28:51,301
看,有只兔子
Look, there's a rabbit.

401
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,912
嗯
Yeah.

402
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:55,538
你好,兔子
Hey there, rabbit.

403
00:28:56,751 --> 00:28:58,116
它真可爱
It's so cute.

404
00:29:00,722 --> 00:29:03,122
我十多岁时来过这
I visited this as a young teenager.

405
00:29:04,025 --> 00:29:07,791
它当时留给我的印象比博物馆更深
It left a bigger impression on me at that time than the museums.

406
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,793
是吗?它很小
Yeah? It's tiny.

407
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,090
我知道
I know.

408
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,796
和我们聊天的墓地管理员是个矮小老头
A little old man talked to us. He was the groundskeeper.

409
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,836
他解释说大部分埋在这里的人...
He explained that most of the people buried here...

410
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:20,564
...都是被多瑙河水冲上岸的
...had washed up on the bank of the Danube.

411
00:29:22,076 --> 00:29:23,543
有多久的历史了?
How old are these?

412
00:29:24,045 --> 00:29:27,811
大约始建于本世纪初,被称为无名公墓
Around the beginning of the century. It's called No Name Cemetery...

413
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,610
...因为他们大都不知道姓甚名谁
...because they often didn't know who those people were.

414
00:29:30,818 --> 00:29:32,911
要不就是有名无姓
Maybe a first name, that's all.

415
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:35,154
为什么所有尸体都是冲上岸的?
Why were all the bodies washing up?

416
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:39,292
我猜有些是因为船只失事之类的事故
I think some were from accidents on boats and things like that.

417
00:29:39,494 --> 00:29:42,793
但大部分是投河自尽的
But most of them were suicides that jumped in the river.

418
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,530
我喜欢这种想法--无名之人从世上消失
I always liked the idea of all those unknown people lost in the world.

419
00:29:48,736 --> 00:29:50,795
我是小女孩时曾想过...
When I was a little girl, I thought...

420
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:53,530
...如果没有任何亲友知道你已经死了...
...if none of your family or friends knew you were dead...

421
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:55,709
...那就象没有真正死去
...then it's like not really being dead.

422
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,811
大家可以替你作最好或最坏的设想
People can invent the best and the worst for you.

423
00:30:02,317 --> 00:30:04,376
我想她就在这
Here she is, I think.

424
00:30:04,652 --> 00:30:08,019
没错,这个我记得最清楚
Yeah, this is the one I remember the most.

425
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:13,586
她死的时候只有13岁
She was only 13 when she died.

426
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:18,398
在我来说意味深长, 我第一次来这就是13岁
That meant something to me. I was that age when I first saw this.

427
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:27,671
我现在长了10岁,可她还是13岁
Now I'm 10 years older, and she's still 13, I guess.

428
00:30:28,843 --> 00:30:29,969
这很有趣
That's funny.

429
00:30:50,264 --> 00:30:52,323
那边就是多瑙河
That's the Danube over there.

430
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:54,495
是条河,对吧?
That's a river, right?

431
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:55,725
是的
Yeah.

432
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:05,269
真是...
This is...

433
00:31:05,546 --> 00:31:06,911
...壮观
...gorgeous.

434
00:31:07,915 --> 00:31:10,042
是啊,真美
Yeah, this is beautiful.

435
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:17,518
我是指,我们赶上了...
I mean, we got....

436
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:19,416
我们赶上了日落
We got a sunset here.

437
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:22,727
-是的 -我们在摩天轮上
-Yeah. -We got the Ferris wheel.

438
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:26,629
这就象...
It seems like...

439
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:28,925
...是个...
...this would be a....

440
00:31:30,938 --> 00:31:31,870
什么?
What?

441
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:37,336
你知道的...
You know....

442
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,950
你的意思是不是想吻我?
Are you trying to say you want to kiss me?

443
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:55,244
你知道吗?
But you know what?

444
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:58,391
生于哪个时代并不重要
It doesn't matter what generation you're born into.

445
00:32:58,593 --> 00:32:59,855
看看我的父母
Look at my parents.

446
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:04,259
68年5月事件,愤怒的年轻人反对一切
They were angry, young May ' 68 people revolting against everything.

447
00:33:04,465 --> 00:33:08,231
政府,及其保守的天主教后台....
The government, their conservative Catholic backgrounds....

448
00:33:08,436 --> 00:33:11,928
我出生之后,我父亲成为成功的建筑师
Then I was born, and my father became a successful architect.

449
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:15,165
他建造桥梁时我们周游世界...
We traveled around the world while he built bridges...

450
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:17,606
...当然,还有塔和别的什么
...and, you know, towers and stuff.

451
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:20,677
我是说,我真没什么可抱怨的
I mean, I really can't complain about anything.

452
00:33:20,882 --> 00:33:22,873
他们爱我胜过一切...
They love me more than anything...

453
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,247
...我在他们努力营造的自由氛围中长大
...and I've been raised with all the freedom they fought for.

454
00:33:26,454 --> 00:33:29,480
对我而言这是另一种形式的抗争
And yet, for me now, it's another type of fight.

455
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:33,023
我们总是面对相同的问题,却不知道...
We have to deal with the same shit, but we can't really know...

456
00:33:33,227 --> 00:33:35,718
...是和谁对抗,敌人是什么
...who or, you know, what the enemy is.

457
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,763
我不知道是否真有这么个敌人
I don't know if there really is an enemy.

458
00:33:38,966 --> 00:33:41,025
所有的父母都不会教育孩子
Everybody's parents fucked them up.

459
00:33:41,235 --> 00:33:44,693
有钱人的孩子父母给予得太多, 穷人的孩子则相反
Rich kids' parents gave them too much. Poor kids', not enough.

460
00:33:44,906 --> 00:33:47,272
关爱太多,关爱不够
too much attention, not enough attention.

461
00:33:47,475 --> 00:33:50,706
或是遗弃或是教些错误的东西
They either left or taught them the wrong things.

462
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:54,712
我父母是两个相爱并不太深的人...
My parents are just two people who didn't like each other much...

463
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:56,781
...他们结婚,生子
...who got married and had a kid.

464
00:33:56,984 --> 00:33:59,316
然后尽力对我好
And they tried their best to be nice to me.

465
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:03,488
-你父母离婚了? -是的,最终离了
-Did your parents divorce? -Yeah, finally.

466
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:05,921
他们早就该离,凑合在一起...
They should have done it sooner. They stuck together...

467
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,790
...是为了我和我姐姐,真是感激不尽
...for the well-being of my sister and l. Thank you very much.

468
00:34:10,097 --> 00:34:13,533
我记得我母亲当着父亲的面告诉我...
I remember my mother told me right in front of my father...

469
00:34:13,734 --> 00:34:16,259
...他并不是很想要我
...that he didn't really want to have me.

470
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:19,769
他发现她怀孕时很恼火
That he was pissed off when he found out she was pregnant.

471
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:23,603
生我是个大错误, 这对我的思想影响很大
That I was a big mistake. That really shaped the way I think.

472
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:28,077
我习惯从一个不该存在的人的视角看世界
I always saw the world as this place where I really wasn't meant to be.

473
00:34:28,282 --> 00:34:29,271
太悲哀了
That's so sad.

474
00:34:29,483 --> 00:34:32,646
事实上我对此颇感自豪
Well, I mean, I eventually kind of took pride in it.

475
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:35,344
就好象生命是我自己创造的
You know, like my life was my own doing.

476
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:38,684
就象我是盛宴上的不速之客
You know, like I was crashing the big party.

477
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:40,918
可以这样看待
That's the way to see it.

478
00:34:41,128 --> 00:34:44,495
我父母仍在一起,我猜他们很幸福
My parents are still married and I guess they're happy.

479
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:49,628
不过我觉得未雨绸缪是正确的做法
But I think it's healthy to rebel against everything that came before.

480
00:34:54,075 --> 00:34:56,339
知道吗,最近我很好奇...
You know, I've been wondering lately...

481
00:34:57,111 --> 00:35:00,547
...你认识什么婚姻幸福的人吗?
...do you know anyone who's in a happy relationship?

482
00:35:02,216 --> 00:35:05,208
当然,我认识一些幸福的夫妇
Yeah, sure. You know, I know happy couples.

483
00:35:05,987 --> 00:35:08,046
可我认为他们在互相欺骗
But I think they lie to each other.

484
00:35:08,756 --> 00:35:10,018
是啊
Yeah.

485
00:35:10,992 --> 00:35:13,085
人们能在谎言中生活一辈子
People can live their whole life as a lie.

486
00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:15,194
我的祖母结了婚...
My grandmother was married...

487
00:35:15,396 --> 00:35:18,490
...我以为她有份简单的爱情生活
...and I thought she had an uncomplicated love life.

488
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:22,726
但她向我承认,她穷其一生...
But she just confessed to me that she spent her whole life...

489
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:25,997
...在梦想着她爱的另一个男人
...dreaming about another man she was in love with.

490
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:29,538
她屈从于命运,这太可悲了
She just accepted her fate. It's so sad.

491
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:32,875
但我也很高兴她有那种情感...
In the same time, I love that she had these emotions...

492
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,412
...而我从没想过她会有
...and feelings I never thought she had.

493
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:37,846
我敢说那样更好
I guarantee you it was better that way.

494
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:41,419
一旦了解了他,她最终会对他感到失望
If she'd known him, he'd have disappointed her eventually.

495
00:35:41,622 --> 00:35:43,988
-你怎么知道? -我当然知道
-How do you know? -I know. I know.

496
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:46,751
人们将浪漫想象得高于一切
People put romantic projections on everything.

497
00:35:46,961 --> 00:35:49,657
那没有任何事实依据
It's not based in any kind of reality.

498
00:35:49,864 --> 00:35:53,561
浪漫想象? 哦,摩天轮里的就是浪漫先生啦?
Romantic projections? Oh, Mr. Romantic up in the Ferris wheel?

499
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:57,067
"哦,吻我吧,日落是多么美丽啊"
"Oh, kiss me. The sunset. Oh, it's so beautiful."

500
00:35:57,271 --> 00:36:00,763
说说你祖母吧,你刚才是怎么说的?
Tell me about your grandmother. What were you saying about her?

501
00:36:19,193 --> 00:36:20,421
看他们的口型
Check these guys out.

502
00:36:20,628 --> 00:36:25,122
"汉斯,我要做忏悔,我没穿内衣"
"Hans, I have a confession. I'm not wearing underwear underneath this."

503
00:36:25,332 --> 00:36:27,994
"哦,是吗?这让你害怕了?"
"Oh, really? Does that frighten you? "

504
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:35,841
可以告诉你个秘密吗?
Can I tell you a secret?

505
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,234
当然
Yeah.

506
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,571
过来
Come here.

507
00:36:38,913 --> 00:36:40,380
-什么? -过来
-What? -Come here.

508
00:36:54,428 --> 00:36:57,420
这个看手相的看起来挺有趣
Look at this palm reader. She's interesting looking.

509
00:36:57,631 --> 00:36:58,655
是的
Yeah.

510
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,567
怎么了?
-Uh-oh. Uh-oh. -What?

511
00:37:01,035 --> 00:37:03,526
-她注意到了 -她不会过来的
-I made eye contact. -She's not coming over here.

512
00:37:03,738 --> 00:37:05,729
-不,她会 -哦,见鬼
-Yes, she is. -Oh, shit.

513
00:37:08,909 --> 00:37:10,069
哦,不
Oh, no.

514
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:12,335
-你想看手相吗? -不
-You want your palm read? -No.

515
00:37:12,546 --> 00:37:14,707
-你肯定? -我肯定
-Are you sure? -I'm sure.

516
00:37:14,915 --> 00:37:16,405
你好
-Okay. -Hello.

517
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,315
她来了
Oh, here she is.

518
00:37:28,562 --> 00:37:30,496
我想要你看个手相
I want your palm read.

519
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:34,796
行,多少钱?
Yeah. How much is it?

520
00:37:35,236 --> 00:37:36,726
算你50
For you, 50.

521
00:37:37,037 --> 00:37:38,095
行吗?
Okay?

522
00:37:38,472 --> 00:37:39,439
行
Okay.

523
00:37:46,046 --> 00:37:49,015
你正在旅行...
So you have been on a journey...

524
00:37:49,216 --> 00:37:51,184
...你不是本地人
...and you're a stranger to this place.

525
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:53,854
你是个...
You are...

526
00:37:54,054 --> 00:37:55,612
...冒险家
...an adventurer.

527
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:57,648
一个探索者
A seeker.

528
00:37:58,692 --> 00:38:00,683
你内心中有个冒险家
An adventurer in your mind.

529
00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:08,932
你对女性的力量很感兴趣
You are interested in the power of the woman.

530
00:38:09,136 --> 00:38:14,039
还有女性潜在的力量和创造力
In the woman's deep strength and creativity.

531
00:38:14,441 --> 00:38:16,773
你正在成为这种女人
You're becoming this woman.

532
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:26,419
你需要摆脱自己拙劣的生活
You need to resign yourself to the awkwardness of life.

533
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:30,488
只有找到内心深处的宁静...
Only if you find peace within yourself...

534
00:38:31,158 --> 00:38:34,719
...才能找到和别人的真正关联
...will you find true connection with others.

535
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,699
你和他并不熟是吗?
That is a stranger to you?

536
00:38:40,534 --> 00:38:41,865
我想是的
I guess so.

537
00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:50,303
你不会有事,他正在学习
You will be all right. He's learning.

538
00:38:51,111 --> 00:38:52,100
好了
Okay.

539
00:38:52,713 --> 00:38:53,645
给钱
Money.

540
00:39:01,455 --> 00:39:03,389
你们都是星宿
You're both stars.

541
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,149
别忘了
Don't forget.

542
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:08,686
当星星在亿万年前爆炸时...
When the stars exploded billions of years ago...

543
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:11,694
...它们形成了世上的一切
...they formed everything that is this world.

544
00:39:11,899 --> 00:39:14,766
我们认识的一切都是星尘
Everything we know is stardust.

545
00:39:14,969 --> 00:39:18,905
所以别忘了,你们也是
So don't forget, you are stardust.

546
00:39:23,744 --> 00:39:25,371
这很不错
That's very nice and all.

547
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:27,911
我是指我们都是星尘
I mean, that we're all stardust...

548
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,549
...而你会成为一个伟大的女性
...and you're becoming this great woman.

549
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:33,642
不过我希望你不要太当真...
But I hope you don't take that any more seriously...

550
00:39:33,854 --> 00:39:35,981
...和报纸上的占卜相比
...than some horoscope in a newspaper.

551
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:40,456
为什么?她知道我在渡假, 还知道我们互不相识
What? She knew I was on vacation and that we didn't know each other...

552
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:43,562
...还有我会成为一个伟大的女人
...and that I was going to become this great woman.

553
00:39:43,764 --> 00:39:46,130
那"我在学习"是什么鬼话?
But what was that "l am learning" bullshit?

554
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:48,665
那是些套话,明白吗?
That's way condescending, you know?

555
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:50,928
当时她并没看我的手
I mean, she wasn't even doing me.

556
00:39:51,171 --> 00:39:55,471
如果投机取巧者真是那样必须说真话的话
I mean, if opportunists like that ever had to tell the real truth...

557
00:39:55,676 --> 00:39:57,735
...他们就会失业
...it would put them out of business.

558
00:39:57,945 --> 00:40:02,541
我乐意看到一个瘦小老妇 把她的所有积蓄...
Just once, I'd love to see some little old lady save up all her money...

559
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:07,414
...拿去算命,到那后算命的女人说...
...to go to the fortuneteller. She'd get there and the woman would say...

560
00:40:09,456 --> 00:40:12,550
"明天和你的下半辈子...
..."Tomorrow and all your remaining days...

561
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,785
"...会和今天全然相同...
...will be exactly like today...

562
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,520
"...在无聊中度日
...a tedious collection of hours.

563
00:40:17,731 --> 00:40:20,962
"你不会有新激情和新想法
And you will have no new passions and no new thoughts...

564
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,568
"...没有新历程
...and no new travels.

565
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:26,672
"一旦死去就会被完全遗忘
And when you die, you'll be completely forgotten.

566
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:29,108
"请给50先令"
Fifty schillings, please."

567
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,039
这是我乐意看到的
That I'd like to see.

568
00:40:32,112 --> 00:40:33,545
这太有意思了...
It's so funny how...

569
00:40:33,747 --> 00:40:37,274
...她竟然没怎么注意你,不知是为什么
...she almost didn't notice you. It's weird. I wonder why.

570
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:41,648
她睿智而且热情,我很喜欢听她说的话
She was really wise and intense. I really loved what she said.

571
00:40:41,855 --> 00:40:45,689
你是花钱来听让自己感觉良好的话
You pay your money to hear what makes you feel good about yourself.

572
00:40:45,893 --> 00:40:49,385
维也纳也许有什么穷街陋巷能买到毒品
Maybe there's a seedy section of vienna. We can buy a hit of crack.

573
00:40:49,596 --> 00:40:51,120
那不是更好?
Would you like that?

574
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:53,456
你也太...
You're so....

575
00:40:54,668 --> 00:40:56,761
星尘,星尘
Stardust. Stardust.

576
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,976
有个展览
There's an exhibition.

577
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:13,050
我们赶不上了,要下周才开始
I guess we'll miss it. It doesn't start until next week.

578
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,454
看来是这样
Yeah, I think so.

579
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:20,490
其实我在博物馆见过这个
I actually saw this one in a museum.

580
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:23,729
我一直盯着它看
I stared and stared at it.

581
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:26,229
足足有45分钟
Must have been 45 minutes.

582
00:41:27,001 --> 00:41:28,059
我喜欢它
I love it.

583
00:41:28,936 --> 00:41:31,370
La Voie Ferree,真漂亮
La voie ferree. It's great.

584
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,735
我喜欢这种人物溶入背景的方式
I love the way the people are dissolving into the background.

585
00:41:38,145 --> 00:41:39,077
看这个
Look at this.

586
00:41:40,848 --> 00:41:42,338
似乎环境...
It's like the environments...

587
00:41:42,783 --> 00:41:44,944
...比人物还要强烈
...are stronger than the people.

588
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,555
他的人物轮廓总是很简略
His human figures are always so transitory.

589
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,816
有意思吧,简略?
It's funny. Transitory?

590
00:41:52,326 --> 00:41:53,793
简略
Transitory.

591
00:42:12,846 --> 00:42:15,872
-你觉得开门没有? -不知道,试试看
-You think this is open? -I don't know. Let's try it.

592
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:44,040
我到过一家这样的教堂...
I was in an old church like this...

593
00:42:44,244 --> 00:42:47,372
...几天前在布达佩斯和我祖母一起
...with my grandmother a few days ago in Budapest.

594
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:52,316
尽管我排斥大部分宗教的东西...
Even though I reject most of the religious thing...

595
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,612
...可还是不自觉地 感受到来这的人...
...I can't help but feeling for those people that come here...

596
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:00,089
...迷失,痛苦,内疚...
...lost or in pain, guilt...

597
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,160
...在寻求某种答案
...looking for some kind of answers.

598
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:08,328
能同时容纳那么多代人的 痛苦和快乐的地方令...
It fascinates me how a single place can join pain and happiness...

599
00:43:08,535 --> 00:43:10,867
...令我着迷
...of so many generations.

600
00:43:11,472 --> 00:43:13,565
你和祖母很亲近?
You're close with your grandmother?

601
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,400
是的
Yeah.

602
00:43:18,812 --> 00:43:22,509
大概是因为我经常有种奇特的感觉...
I think it's because I always have this strange feeling...

603
00:43:22,716 --> 00:43:26,709
...我是那个躺着垂死的衰老妇人
...that I'm this very old woman laying down, about to die.

604
00:43:28,322 --> 00:43:30,517
知道吗,我的生活就是...
You know, that my life is just...

605
00:43:30,824 --> 00:43:32,553
...她的记忆或是什么
...her memories or something.

606
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,925
这太疯狂了
That's so wild.

607
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:43,562
我时常觉得自己仍然是13岁的小孩...
I always think that I'm still this 13-year-old boy...

608
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:46,864
...不知道怎么做成年人,装模作样...
...who doesn't really know how to be an adult, pretending to...

609
00:43:47,074 --> 00:43:51,568
...过自己的生活, 逼不得已时做做笔记
...live my life, taking notes for when I'll really have to do it.

610
00:43:51,945 --> 00:43:54,846
仿佛是穿着戏服在演一场初中话剧
Like I'm in a dress rehearsal for a junior high play.

611
00:43:57,284 --> 00:43:58,774
真有趣
That's funny.

612
00:43:59,586 --> 00:44:01,884
那么在摩天轮上时,就象是...
Then up there in the Ferris wheel, it was like...

613
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:06,150
...垂老妇人吻了一个小男孩,是吗?
...this very old woman kissing this very young boy. Right?

614
00:44:10,964 --> 00:44:15,025
你知道贵格教徒和贵格教的宗旨吗?
Do you know anything about the Quakers, the Quaker religion?

615
00:44:15,469 --> 00:44:16,527
不太清楚
No, not much.

616
00:44:17,437 --> 00:44:20,065
我参加过贵格教徒的婚礼...
Well, I went to this Quaker wedding once...

617
00:44:20,274 --> 00:44:22,139
...感觉很奇特
...and it was fantastic.

618
00:44:22,476 --> 00:44:23,636
他们的做法是...
What they do is...

619
00:44:23,844 --> 00:44:28,110
...新人走进去跪在所有来宾的面前...
...the couple comes in and they kneel in front of the whole congregation...

620
00:44:28,315 --> 00:44:29,839
...然后彼此凝视
...and they stare at each other.

621
00:44:31,018 --> 00:44:34,977
没人说话,除非他们觉得 是上帝要他们交谈...
Nobody says a word unless they feel that God moves them to speak...

622
00:44:35,189 --> 00:44:36,850
...或发言
...or say something.

623
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:40,453
然后,经过大约一小时...
And then, after an hour or so of just...

624
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,760
...相互凝视...
...staring at each other...

625
00:44:44,231 --> 00:44:45,596
...就成了夫妻
...they're married.

626
00:44:47,534 --> 00:44:49,593
太美了,我喜欢这样
That's beautiful. I like that.

627
00:45:06,386 --> 00:45:07,876
有个可怕的故事
This is a horrible story.

628
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:09,945
是什么?
What?

629
00:45:10,524 --> 00:45:12,890
这里不适合讲这事
It's not the appropriate place to tell it.

630
00:45:13,093 --> 00:45:16,028
我曾和一个朋友开车兜风
Well, I was driving around with this buddy of mine.

631
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,130
他是个坚定的无神论者
He's a big atheist, you know.

632
00:45:18,332 --> 00:45:21,199
他在一个流浪汉身旁停下车
And he came to a stop next to this homeless guy.

633
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,698
然后掏出100美元...
My buddy takes out a $ 100 bill...

634
00:45:23,904 --> 00:45:25,303
...探出车窗...
...and leans out the window...

635
00:45:25,505 --> 00:45:28,770
...问道,"你相信上帝吗?"
...and he says, "Do you believe in God? "

636
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:33,341
那个人看看我的朋友,看看钱
And the guy looks at my friend, he looks at the money.

637
00:45:33,614 --> 00:45:35,514
说道...
He says...

638
00:45:35,882 --> 00:45:37,543
..."是的,我相信"
..."Yes, I do."

639
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:39,685
我朋友说,"回答错误"
My friend says, "Wrong answer."

640
00:45:39,886 --> 00:45:41,376
然后开车走了
We drove away.

641
00:45:42,222 --> 00:45:43,712
太可恶了
That's mean.

642
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:58,836
如果你不下火车,现在该到巴黎了吧?
Would you be in Paris by now if you hadn't gotten off the train?

643
00:45:59,306 --> 00:46:00,967
不,还没到
No, not yet.

644
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:03,337
那你会做些什么?
What would you be doing?

645
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:06,205
也许会在机场逗留...
I'd probably be hanging around the airport...

646
00:46:06,413 --> 00:46:09,780
...因为你不在而对着咖啡哭泣
...crying in my coffee because you didn't come with me.

647
00:46:13,887 --> 00:46:17,653
也许我会在萨尔茨堡和别人下车
I'd probably gotten off the train in Salzburg with someone else.

648
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,826
哦,是吗?我懂了
Oh, yeah? Oh, I see.

649
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,927
我只是个愚蠢的美国人...
So I'm just a dumb American...

650
00:46:22,129 --> 00:46:26,259
...只能用来当作临时点缀,是吗?
...momentarily decorating your blank canvas, huh?

651
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,628
-我玩得很开心 -是吗?
-I'm having a great time. -Really?

652
00:46:29,836 --> 00:46:31,064
我也是
Me too.

653
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,841
我很高兴没人知道我在这
I'm glad, because no one knows I'm here.

654
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,033
不认识能告诉我...
I don't know anyone that would tell me...

655
00:46:37,244 --> 00:46:39,337
...你所做过的所有坏事的人
...all those bad things you've done.

656
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,878
-我可以告诉你 -我相信
-I'll tell you some. -Yeah, I'm sure.

657
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:46,876
听过太多坏事之后我总觉得...
You hear so much shit about people. I always feel like...

658
00:46:47,087 --> 00:46:49,487
...赴约时象个将军
...the general of an army when I start dating.

659
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:51,783
制订好战略战术
Plotting my strategy and maneuverings...

660
00:46:51,992 --> 00:46:55,519
...了解他的弱点, 什么能伤害他,征服他
...knowing his weak points, what would hurt him, seduce him.

661
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:57,262
真是恐怖
It's horrible.

662
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,331
如果我们一直呆在一块...
If we were always around each other...

663
00:47:03,537 --> 00:47:07,337
...那我第一件能令你发疯的事是什么?
...what would be the first thing about me that would drive you mad?

664
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:11,044
不,我不想回答这个问题
No. I'm not going to answer this question.

665
00:47:11,244 --> 00:47:14,338
有个和我约会过的姑娘经常问我...
I dated this girl once who used to always ask me that.

666
00:47:14,548 --> 00:47:16,140
"我哪方面让你发疯?"
"What about me bugs you? "

667
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:20,047
最后我说, "我觉得你的批评方式不太好"
Finally I said, "l don't think you handle criticism too well."

668
00:47:20,253 --> 00:47:23,347
她勃然大怒和我分了手,这是真的
She flew into a rage and broke up with me. That's true.

669
00:47:23,557 --> 00:47:25,684
其实她是要找个借口...
All she wanted was to have an excuse...

670
00:47:25,892 --> 00:47:28,588
...来告诉我她不该和我交往
...to tell me what she thought was wrong with me.

671
00:47:28,795 --> 00:47:30,023
你也想这样吗?
Is that what you want?

672
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,959
我哪些方面让你发狂?
Something about me bugs you?

673
00:47:32,466 --> 00:47:35,367
-我有什么会令你崩溃? -根本没有
-What is it about me bugs you? -Nothing at all.

674
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:38,037
如果非要说的话,会是什么?
If it had to be something, what would it be?

675
00:47:38,405 --> 00:47:41,897
如果非得有,而我非得考虑的话...
If it had to be something, if I had to think about it...

676
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,704
...我不太喜欢你对看手相的反应
...I kind of didn't really like this reaction at the palm reader.

677
00:47:45,912 --> 00:47:48,278
就象只好斗的公鸡
You were like this rooster prick.

678
00:47:48,482 --> 00:47:50,347
什么叫好斗的公鸡?
What the hell is a rooster prick?

679
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,040
你象个哭闹的孩子...
You were like a boy whining...

680
00:47:52,252 --> 00:47:54,914
...因为所有注意力都不在你身上
...because all the attention wasn't focused on him.

681
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:58,216
好吧,听着,那女人蒙蔽了你,对吗?
All right, listen. This woman robs you blind, okay?

682
00:47:58,425 --> 00:48:00,757
你象个路过冰淇淋店的小孩...
You were like a boy walking by an ice-cream store...

683
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,725
...因为妈妈不给他买奶昔而哭闹
...crying because his mom won't buy him a milk shake.

684
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:06,990
我不在乎那江湖骗子说过什么--
I don't care what this charlatan has to say about--

685
00:48:09,202 --> 00:48:10,328
什么?
What?

686
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,674
我懂一点,但他不懂,抱歉
I understand a little, but he doesn't at all.

687
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:21,237
能问你个问题吗?
May I ask you a question?

688
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:26,484
我想和你们做个交易
So I would like to make a deal with you.

689
00:48:28,388 --> 00:48:32,586
我不直接向你们要钱,而是让你们说一个词
I mean, instead of just asking you for money, I will ask you for a word.

690
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:37,393
你们给我一个词,然后我会写一首诗
You give me a word, I take the word, and then I will write a poem...

691
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,098
...将它包含在内
...with the word inside.

692
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:42,801
如果你们喜欢我的诗...
And if you like it, if you like my poem...

693
00:48:43,203 --> 00:48:45,763
...觉得它能给你们的生活增添色彩...
...if it adds something to your life in any way...

694
00:48:45,972 --> 00:48:48,600
...那就随意给我一些报酬
...then you can pay me whatever you feel like.

695
00:48:49,276 --> 00:48:51,267
当然,我会用英语来写
I'll write in English, of course.

696
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,207
-行 -行,很不错
-Okay. -All right. Great.

697
00:48:56,783 --> 00:48:57,875
那么?
So?

698
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,282
选个词吧
Pick a word.

699
00:49:03,156 --> 00:49:04,248
一个词
A word.

700
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:08,056
-奶昔 -奶昔?哦,不错
-Milk shake. -Milk shake? Oh, good.

701
00:49:08,261 --> 00:49:11,162
-我想说"好斗公鸡"的,不过挺好,奶昔
I was gonna say "rooster prick." But great. Milk shake.

702
00:49:11,364 --> 00:49:12,797
''奶昔''?
"Milk shake"?

703
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:15,130
好的,奶昔
Okay, milk shake.

704
00:49:15,802 --> 00:49:17,793
好了,那么...
-All right, so.... -Good.

705
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:33,081
我喜欢这个维也纳人变相的乞讨方式
I gotta say, I like this viennese variation of bum.

706
00:49:33,286 --> 00:49:36,380
我喜欢他"给生活增添色彩"那句话
I like what he said about adding something to your life.

707
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:40,390
我们刚才是不是有了第一次争执?
So, were we having our first fight back there?

708
00:49:41,828 --> 00:49:43,921
我觉得是争执过
I think so. I think we were.

709
00:49:44,164 --> 00:49:47,725
就算有,为什么大家都觉得冲突很糟糕呢?
Even if we were, why does everyone think conflict is so bad?

710
00:49:47,934 --> 00:49:50,767
争执能带来很多好的事物
There's a lot of good things coming out of conflict.

711
00:49:50,971 --> 00:49:52,700
对,我也这样想
Yeah, I guess so.

712
00:49:53,106 --> 00:49:56,337
我常想如果自己能面对现实...
I always think if I could just accept the fact...

713
00:49:56,543 --> 00:50:00,479
...面对生活中可以预见的艰难之处...
...that my life was supposed to be difficult, that's what's expected...

714
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,511
...也许就不会那么郁闷
...then I might not get so pissed off.

715
00:50:02,716 --> 00:50:05,514
遇到好事时会为之高兴
And I'd just be glad when something nice happens.

716
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,219
所以我还在上学
That's why I'm still in school.

717
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,911
这样可以提高竞争能力
It's easier to have something to fight against.

718
00:50:10,123 --> 00:50:13,854
我们骨子里都有这种强烈的好胜心
Well, we've all had such competitiveness ingrained in us.

719
00:50:14,294 --> 00:50:17,422
你也知道,我可以做一些无聊的事
You know, I can be doing the most nothing thing.

720
00:50:17,631 --> 00:50:19,963
投飞镖或是打台球
Throwing some darts or shooting some pool.

721
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:22,999
然后很自然地产生这种想法
Then all of a sudden, I feel it come over me.

722
00:50:23,203 --> 00:50:25,433
我必须赢
I have got to win.

723
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:29,097
你邀我一起下车也是出于好胜心吗?
Is that why you tried to get me off the train? Competitiveness?

724
00:50:29,309 --> 00:50:30,640
你是指什么?
What do you mean?

725
00:50:32,546 --> 00:50:33,740
写好了
I got a poem.

726
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,672
哦,是吗
Oh, all right.

727
00:50:37,384 --> 00:50:39,045
能念给我们听吗?
Will you read it to us?

728
00:50:42,689 --> 00:50:44,088
当然可以
Sure. Okay.

729
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,062
白日梦般的错觉
"Daydream delusion

730
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:52,498
豪华车竟有睫毛
Limousine eyelash

731
00:50:53,433 --> 00:50:55,731
哦,宝贝,你的脸如此美丽
Oh, baby, with your pretty face

732
00:50:57,037 --> 00:51:00,973
坠一滴泪入我的酒杯 看着那双大眼睛
Drop a tear in my wine glass Look at those big eyes

733
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:03,368
明白到你对我的意义
See what you mean to me

734
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:06,577
犹如蛋糕和奶昔
Sweetcakes and milk shakes

735
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,041
我是迷人的天使
I am a delusion angel

736
00:51:09,683 --> 00:51:11,776
我是奇幻的展台
I' m a fantasy parade

737
00:51:12,285 --> 00:51:16,221
想让你明白我的心思 不要再继续猜量
I want you to know what I think Don't want you to guess anymore

738
00:51:16,423 --> 00:51:18,823
你不知我来自何处
You have no idea where I came from

739
00:51:19,192 --> 00:51:21,092
我们不知该前往何方
We have no idea where we're going

740
00:51:21,428 --> 00:51:23,157
只管融入生活
Lodged in life

741
00:51:23,363 --> 00:51:24,921
就象河流的支脉
Like branches in the river

742
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:28,066
奔腾而下,随波逐流
Flowing downstream Caught in the current

743
00:51:28,301 --> 00:51:29,825
我中有你
I carry you

744
00:51:30,103 --> 00:51:31,593
你中有我
You'll carry me

745
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,034
就该是这样
That's how it could be

746
00:51:35,241 --> 00:51:36,902
你明白我了吗?
Don't you know me?

747
00:51:37,877 --> 00:51:39,708
现在你明白我没有?
Don't you know me by now? "

748
00:51:40,947 --> 00:51:42,141
太棒了
Great.

749
00:51:42,816 --> 00:51:45,046
-谢谢 -谢谢,伙计
-Thanks. -Thanks, man.

750
00:51:48,655 --> 00:51:49,883
给你
Here you go.

751
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,386
-谢谢 -不用
-Thanks. -All right.

752
00:51:53,593 --> 00:51:55,788
-给,谢谢你 -谢谢
-Here. Thank you. -Thank you.

753
00:51:55,996 --> 00:51:56,894
祝你好运
Good luck.

754
00:52:13,179 --> 00:52:14,874
写得很棒,是吧?
It was wonderful, no?

755
00:52:19,552 --> 00:52:22,214
-怎么了? -那可能不是他写的
-What? -He probably didn't just write that.

756
00:52:22,422 --> 00:52:25,084
也许他只是加了一个词进去
He wrote it, but he probably plugs that word in.

757
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:27,555
不管是"奶昔"还是什么
You know, whatever, "milk shake."

758
00:52:27,761 --> 00:52:29,353
你想说什么?
What do you mean?

759
00:52:29,562 --> 00:52:31,757
没什么,我喜欢,很不错
Nothing. I loved it. It was great.

760
00:52:39,506 --> 00:52:42,031
知道什么让我发疯吗?人们谈论...
You know what drives me crazy? People talking about...

761
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,938
...科技如何伟大,如何节省时间
...how great technology is, how it saves all this time.

762
00:52:45,145 --> 00:52:48,137
但节省了时间却不加以利用有什么好呢？
But what good is saved time if nobody uses it?

763
00:52:48,348 --> 00:52:50,680
或者只是变成更多的工作
If it just turns into more busy work.

764
00:52:50,884 --> 00:52:55,321
从没听人说，''用打字机省下的时间...
I never hear anybody say, "With the time I've saved using my word processor...

765
00:52:55,522 --> 00:52:58,423
...我要用去寺庙逛逛''
...I'm gonna go to a Zen monastery and hang out."

766
00:52:58,792 --> 00:53:01,784
-从没听说过 -时间太抽象了
-You don't hear that. -Time is so abstract anyway.

767
00:53:02,028 --> 00:53:04,622
-你在看那个女孩? -什么?
-Are you looking at this girl? -What?

768
00:53:04,831 --> 00:53:06,196
没什么
Nothing.

769
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:08,266
想进去吗?
You wanna go in here?

770
00:53:08,468 --> 00:53:11,926
-想不想进去? -行啊,是夜总会对吧?
-You wanna go in here? -Yeah. It's a club, no?

771
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,029
进去?
Wanna go?

772
00:53:15,241 --> 00:53:16,333
你好
Hello.

773
00:53:18,211 --> 00:53:20,042
50先令
Fifty schillings.

774
00:53:20,246 --> 00:53:23,147
-每个人 -我这有100,给
-Each. -I got 100. Here, I got it.

775
00:53:23,983 --> 00:53:26,144
我请你喝啤酒,谢谢
I'll buy you a beer. Thank you.

776
00:54:14,134 --> 00:54:16,364
-你请我喝啤酒? -对
-You gonna buy me a beer? -Yeah.

777
00:54:20,273 --> 00:54:22,969
这里的美国啤酒贵不贵?
You think Old Milwaukee is expensive here?

778
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:54,670
我们还没说过你是否正在和谁交往吧?
We haven't talked about this yet, but are you dating anyone?

779
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:59,243
例如有男朋友什么的正等着你回巴黎
You got a boyfriend waiting on you back in Paris or anything like that?

780
00:54:59,445 --> 00:55:02,243
-不,现在没有 -但以前有
-No, not right now. -But you did.

781
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:05,345
我们6个月前分手了
We broke up six months ago.

782
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:08,043
6个月前?哦,真遗憾
Six months ago? Oh, I'm sorry.

783
00:55:08,254 --> 00:55:10,984
这话题就不那么有趣了,说说看
I mean, I'm not that sorry. Tell me about it.

784
00:55:11,191 --> 00:55:14,957
不,太无聊了我不想说
No way. I can't. It's really, really boring.

785
00:55:15,161 --> 00:55:17,129
来吧,跟我说说
Come on. Tell me about it.

786
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,162
好吧,我很失望
I was really disappointed.

787
00:55:21,367 --> 00:55:24,393
原以为能维持一段时间,可他...
I thought this one would last for a while. He was...

788
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:28,672
...愚蠢,粗鲁,没情趣,酗酒....
...very stupid, ugly, bad in bed, alcoholic....

789
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,170
纯粹是个草包
-You know. -A real prize winner.

790
00:55:33,313 --> 00:55:35,213
我是想给他留点面子
I was kind of giving him a favor.

791
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,179
但他离开了我,说什么我太爱他...
But he left me, saying I loved him too much.

792
00:55:38,384 --> 00:55:43,117
妨碍了他的所谓狗屁艺术表现力
I was blocking his artistic expression or some shit like that.

793
00:55:43,857 --> 00:55:46,451
不管怎样,我很受伤害,变得--
But anyway, I was traumatized and became--

794
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:49,290
由于他而变得很困惑
And became totally obsessed with him.

795
00:55:49,796 --> 00:55:52,924
所以去看心理医生,编了个...
So I went to a shrink, and it came up that I had written...

796
00:55:53,132 --> 00:55:57,592
...关于女人想杀死她男友 及如何下手...
...this stupid story about this woman trying to kill her boyfriend...

797
00:55:58,638 --> 00:55:59,935
...的愚蠢故事
...and how she'd do it.

798
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:03,472
...所有怎样下手又不会被抓的细节
It's all the details of how to do it and not get caught--

799
00:56:03,676 --> 00:56:05,667
她想杀死男朋友?
She was gonna kill her boyfriend?

800
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,912
是的,我不会真去做,只是编的罢了
Yeah, she was. It's nothing I would do, but it was just some writing.

801
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,380
是的,我明白
No, I understand.

802
00:56:13,586 --> 00:56:16,419
愚蠢的医生相信了我说的一切
This stupid shrink believed everything I told her.

803
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:20,320
是我第一次就诊,她说必须通知警察
It was my first time seeing her. She said she had to call the police.

804
00:56:20,526 --> 00:56:22,426
她必须通知警察?
She had to call the police?

805
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,928
她完全相信我会付诸行动
She was totally convinced I was really gonna do it.

806
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:30,068
即使我解释那只是我编造的
Even though I had explained it was just some writing.

807
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:33,205
她看着我的眼睛说 "你说的这些...
She said, looking into my eyes, "The way you said it...

808
00:56:33,406 --> 00:56:35,271
...我知道你会去做"
...I know you are going to do it."

809
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:38,035
她纯粹是疯了
She was totally out of her mind.

810
00:56:38,845 --> 00:56:41,405
那是我唯一一次看心理医生
It was my first and last session.

811
00:56:41,614 --> 00:56:43,377
那么后来呢?
So what happened then?

812
00:56:45,285 --> 00:56:47,344
我彻底忘记了他
I totally got over him.

813
00:56:47,787 --> 00:56:49,118
现在我烦恼的是...
But now, I'm obsessed...

814
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:53,816
...如果他死于千里之外的一场事故
...that he's gonna die from an accident or 1000 kilometers away.

815
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,355
受指控的将是我
And I'm gonna be the one accused.

816
00:56:58,831 --> 00:57:01,595
为什么我们会为不那么喜欢的人...
Why is it you become obsessed with people you don't...

817
00:57:01,801 --> 00:57:03,530
...感到困惑呢？
...really like that much?

818
00:57:03,736 --> 00:57:05,101
不知道
I don't know.

819
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,507
那你呢?
So how about you?

820
00:57:10,476 --> 00:57:12,706
-什么? -和谁在一起?
-What? -Are you with anyone?

821
00:57:14,614 --> 00:57:18,380
我们一直回避这个话题可真滑稽
It's funny how we managed to avoid this subject for so long.

822
00:57:18,584 --> 00:57:20,347
可你现在得告诉我
But now you have to tell me.

823
00:57:20,553 --> 00:57:22,748
我对爱的注脚是--
Well, I kind of see love...

824
00:57:22,956 --> 00:57:27,188
两个不知该如何独处的人的庇荫
...as this escape for two people who don't know how to be alone.

825
00:57:28,995 --> 00:57:31,463
真有趣,人们总是说...
It's funny. People always talk about how...

826
00:57:31,664 --> 00:57:34,462
...爱是完全无私的付出
...Iove is this totally unselfish, giving thing.

827
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:37,932
但细想想却除了自私什么都没有
But if you think about it, there's nothing more selfish.

828
00:57:38,771 --> 00:57:40,033
我明白
I know.

829
00:57:40,873 --> 00:57:42,807
那么,你刚和谁分手?
So who just broke up with you?

830
00:57:44,744 --> 00:57:45,904
什么?
What?

831
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,512
听起来你象是受了伤害
You sound like you just were hurt.

832
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,014
我?
Do I?

833
00:57:52,285 --> 00:57:53,547
好吧
All right.

834
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,154
我承认
Big confession.

835
00:57:56,889 --> 00:57:59,483
我应该早告诉你的
I should've told you this earlier or something.

836
00:58:00,493 --> 00:58:02,961
我来欧洲不只是为了..
I didn't come to Europe just to...

837
00:58:03,162 --> 00:58:06,359
...在巴黎散心,读海明威
...hang out and read Hemingway in Paris and shit like that.

838
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,399
整个春季我都在攒钱,想去马德里...
I saved up my money all spring to fly to Madrid...

839
00:58:10,603 --> 00:58:13,163
...和我的女友共渡夏季...
...and spend the summer with my girlfriend--

840
00:58:13,373 --> 00:58:15,102
-你的女友? -前女友
-Your girlfriend? -My ex-girlfriend...

841
00:58:15,308 --> 00:58:18,641
...过去一年来她一直在学艺术史
...who has been on this art history program for the last year.

842
00:58:18,845 --> 00:58:22,246
总之,我到了这,久别重逢...
Anyway, I got here. We were reunited at long last...

843
00:58:22,448 --> 00:58:26,578
...第一晚是和她的6个朋友一起出去吃饭
...and we went out to dinner our first night with six of her friends.

844
00:58:26,786 --> 00:58:29,414
佩德罗,安东尼奥,冈萨罗...
Pedro, Antonio, Gonzalo...

845
00:58:29,622 --> 00:58:31,783
...玛丽娅,老乡苏茜
...Maria, Suzy from home.

846
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:35,358
好几天她都设法回避和我独处...
She managed to avoid being alone with me for the first few days...

847
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:40,191
...慢慢我意识到她并不希望我来
...and I stuck around just to let it sink in that she wished I hadn't come.

848
00:58:41,968 --> 00:58:45,734
于是买了从维也纳起飞的最便宜的机票
So I bought the cheapest flight out, this one leaving out of vienna.

849
00:58:45,938 --> 00:58:49,430
几周内没有航班,所以我又买了火车票
It didn't leave for a couple weeks, so I bought this Eurail pass.

850
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:54,239
知道别人和你分手最糟糕的事是什么吗?
You know what's the worst thing about somebody breaking up with you?

851
00:58:56,149 --> 00:58:58,947
是当你记起自己很少想到...
It's when you remember how little you thought about...

852
00:58:59,152 --> 00:59:01,882
...与之分手的人,并意识到...
...the people you broke up with, and you realize...

853
00:59:02,088 --> 00:59:05,717
...他们也很少想到你
...that that is how little they're thinking about you.

854
00:59:05,925 --> 00:59:08,223
你以为双方都会感觉痛苦...
You'd like to think you're both in pain...

855
00:59:08,428 --> 00:59:11,420
...实际上却是 "嘿,很高兴你离开"
...but really, they're just, "Hey, I'm glad you're gone."

856
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:14,065
相信我,我懂
Believe me, I know.

857
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,291
你该注意积极的一面
You should look at bright colors.

858
00:59:18,004 --> 00:59:19,869
是那个心理医生告诉我的
That's what the shrink told me.

859
00:59:20,073 --> 00:59:22,667
我付她900法郎1小时...
I was paying her 900 francs an hour...

860
00:59:22,875 --> 00:59:25,173
...来倾听我是个杀人狂
...to hear that l was a homicidal maniac...

861
00:59:25,378 --> 00:59:29,439
...如果我注意积极的一面 就能消除我的困惑
...but I could shift my obsession if l would concentrate on bright colors.

862
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:30,911
管用吗?
Did it work?

863
00:59:34,454 --> 00:59:36,513
-对玩弹球没帮助 -对,没有
-Didn't help your pinball. -Well, no.

864
00:59:37,123 --> 00:59:40,923
是的,要知道最近我没杀任何人
Yeah, well, you know, I haven't killed anyone lately.

865
00:59:41,127 --> 00:59:42,458
近来没有?
Not lately?

866
00:59:42,762 --> 00:59:44,662
真不错,你康复了
That's good. You're cured then.

867
00:59:51,104 --> 00:59:54,335
有种猴子,它们整天都在交配...
There's breeds of monkeys, and all they do is have sex...

868
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,107
...从早到晚
...all the time.

869
00:59:56,309 --> 00:59:58,539
它们因此而最少攻击性...
And they turn out to be the least violent...

870
00:59:58,744 --> 01:00:01,713
...最平和,最快乐
...the most peaceful, the most happy.

871
01:00:01,914 --> 01:00:04,405
所以鬼混未必就是坏事
So maybe fooling around's not so bad.

872
01:00:04,617 --> 01:00:07,745
-你是在说猴子吧? -是啊
-Are you talking about monkeys? -Yes, I am.

873
01:00:07,954 --> 01:00:09,319
-我想也是 -怎么?
-I thought so. -Why?

874
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:13,219
我从没听说过, 这让我觉得是为他们鬼混...
I never heard this one. But it reminds me of this perfect...

875
01:00:13,426 --> 01:00:15,860
...找的完美借口
...male argument to justify them fooling around.

876
01:00:16,062 --> 01:00:19,498
母猴子也可以啊,大家都可以
Women monkeys are fooling around too. Everybody's fooling around.

877
01:00:21,334 --> 01:00:24,895
真有趣,我有个可怕而偏激的念头...
That's cute. I have this awful, paranoid thought...

878
01:00:25,104 --> 01:00:28,301
...女权主义是男人创造的,好让他们...
...that feminism was mostly invented by men so they could...

879
01:00:28,508 --> 01:00:29,805
...更方便鬼混
...fool around more.

880
01:00:30,009 --> 01:00:33,172
"女人,解放头脑,解放身体,和我睡觉
"Woman, free your mind, free your body. Sleep with me.

881
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:37,907
"我们都是快乐自由的, 只要能满足我的色欲"
We're all happy and free, as long as I can fuck as much as I can."

882
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:39,650
好了,好了
All right.

883
01:00:39,852 --> 01:00:43,151
这也许包含有生物学的因素
But maybe there's some biological things at work here.

884
01:00:43,356 --> 01:00:44,880
如果你有个岛...
If you had an island...

885
01:00:45,091 --> 01:00:49,721
...岛上有99个女人和1个男人...
...and there were 99 women on the island and only one man...

886
01:00:49,929 --> 01:00:52,727
...1年后也许会多出99个孩子
...in a year, you'd have the possibility of 99 babies.

887
01:00:52,932 --> 01:00:56,231
但如果岛上是99个男人和1个女人...
But if you have an island with 99 men and only one woman...

888
01:00:56,435 --> 01:01:01,099
...1年后就只可能有一个孩子,所以....
...in a year, you have the possibility of only one baby. So....

889
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:02,374
你知道吗?
You know what?

890
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:06,739
我猜岛上也许只会留下43个男人
On this island, I think there will be only, like, maybe 43 men left.

891
01:01:06,946 --> 01:01:10,848
为了和那可怜的女人性交他们会互相残杀
They would've killed each other trying to fuck this poor woman.

892
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:15,282
而另一个岛上会有99个女人,99个孩子
And on the other island, there would be 99 women, 99 babies...

893
01:01:15,488 --> 01:01:17,149
...但不再有男人
...and no more man.

894
01:01:17,356 --> 01:01:19,916
因为她们会把他生吃掉
Because they would've all eaten him alive.

895
01:01:20,126 --> 01:01:21,525
哦,是吗?
Oh, yeah?

896
01:01:21,727 --> 01:01:23,456
对此可以这样说
There's something to that.

897
01:01:23,663 --> 01:01:27,827
某种程度上,女人并不介意毁掉一个男人
On some level, women don't mind the idea of destroying a man.

898
01:01:29,035 --> 01:01:31,902
我曾和我的前女友一起逛街...
I was walking down the street with my ex-girlfriend...

899
01:01:32,104 --> 01:01:36,598
...有4个长相凶恶的人站在一辆跑车附近
...and we'd just walked by these four thuggy-looking guys next to a Camaro.

900
01:01:36,809 --> 01:01:39,972
其中一个说 "嘿,宝贝,屁股真漂亮"
And one of them says, "Hey, baby. Nice ass!"

901
01:01:40,179 --> 01:01:43,842
我觉得 "这没什么,没必要为此生气"
So I'm like, "No big deal. I won't get uptight about this."

902
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:45,608
对,而且他们有4个人
Plus, there were four of them.

903
01:01:45,818 --> 01:01:48,787
就是,可她说 "去你妈的,混蛋"
Exactly. But she says, "Fuck you, dickheads!"

904
01:01:48,988 --> 01:01:52,185
我想,"这下好了,等着瞧吧"
And I'm like, "Okay. Wait a minute, here."

905
01:01:52,391 --> 01:01:54,951
他们可不会过来踢她的屁股
They're not gonna come over and kick her ass.

906
01:01:55,161 --> 01:01:58,096
那么谁会被顶到前线上去呢?
So who just got pushed to the frontline on that one?

907
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:01,266
女人说她们讨厌被严加保护
Women say they hate it if you're all protective.

908
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:05,836
如果照她的意思去做, 又说你不是男人
But if it suits them, then they'll tell you you're being unmanly.

909
01:02:06,038 --> 01:02:10,168
知道吗?我不认为女人真的想毁掉男人
You know what? I don't think woman really wants to destroy man.

910
01:02:11,077 --> 01:02:13,443
即使她们想也不会成功
Even if they want to, they don't succeed.

911
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:15,841
我相信恰恰是男人在毁掉女人...
I'm sure even men are destroying women...

912
01:02:16,048 --> 01:02:19,108
...或者说相对而言更有能力毁掉女人
...or are capable of destroying women much more than women--

913
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:21,616
总之,这令人沮丧,懂我意思吗?
Anyway, it's depressing. You know what?

914
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,415
-你想停止这个话题? -我讨厌这些
-You wanna stop talking about this? -I hate it.

915
01:02:24,624 --> 01:02:26,182
男人,女人,这...
Men, women, it's....

916
01:02:26,392 --> 01:02:28,883
永无休止,就象...
There's no end to it.

917
01:02:29,428 --> 01:02:30,918
就象张跳针的唱片
It's like a skipping record.

918
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:34,327
凡是夫妻都会永远讨论这问题
Every couple's been having this conversation forever.

919
01:02:34,533 --> 01:02:36,626
但没人能得出结论
And nobody came up with anything.

920
01:02:53,286 --> 01:02:55,720
我看过记录片说这是生育舞蹈
I saw a documentary on that. It's a birth dance.

921
01:02:55,921 --> 01:02:57,388
生育舞蹈?
A birth dance?

922
01:03:25,851 --> 01:03:27,512
我该给她钱吗?
Should I give her some money?

923
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,021
所有有意思的事都要花钱
Everything that's interesting costs a little money.

924
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:34,550
生育舞蹈,是吧?
So a birth dance, huh?

925
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,490
在我看来有点象交配舞蹈
Looked a little bit like a mating dance to me.

926
01:03:37,697 --> 01:03:40,495
不,是真的,女人临盆时就跳这个
No, but really. Women used it when giving birth.

927
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:43,100
世上仍有一部分人这么做
In part of the world, they still do it.

928
01:03:44,337 --> 01:03:46,805
临产的女人进到帐蓬里...
The woman in labor enters a tent...

929
01:03:47,006 --> 01:03:49,600
...同部落的女人围着她跳舞
...and the women of her tribe surround her and dance.

930
01:03:49,809 --> 01:03:52,107
并鼓励她一起跳
They encourage her to dance with them...

931
01:03:52,311 --> 01:03:54,609
...可以减轻分娩的痛苦
...so as to make the birth less painful.

932
01:03:54,814 --> 01:03:58,250
孩子降生后大家一起起舞庆贺
And when the baby is born, they all dance in celebration.

933
01:03:59,385 --> 01:04:01,649
我猜我妈妈可不会这样做
I don't think my mom would've gone for that.

934
01:04:02,188 --> 01:04:06,386
我喜欢跳舞这类所有人都能参与的活动
I like the idea of dancing as something everybody participates in.

935
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:09,720
我知道,我听说有个老头...
I know. I heard about this old guy...

936
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:12,056
...他看到年轻人在跳舞
...who was watching some young people dance.

937
01:04:12,264 --> 01:04:13,663
说道,"真美
He said, "How beautiful.

938
01:04:13,866 --> 01:04:16,801
"他们甩掉生殖器以变成天使"
They're shaking off their genitals to become angels."

939
01:04:17,002 --> 01:04:17,900
有意思
I like that.

940
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,298
不过有个问题
One question, though.

941
01:04:19,505 --> 01:04:23,168
当女人们全身心地投入到舞蹈中时...
When the women are dancing and being all spiritual and stuff...

942
01:04:23,376 --> 01:04:24,468
...男人们在哪?
...where are the men?

943
01:04:24,677 --> 01:04:28,977
出去找食物了? 没被邀请?还是女人不需要男人?
Are we out food gathering? Are we not invited? You all don't need us?

944
01:04:29,181 --> 01:04:31,479
男人该庆幸没在交配后被咬下头颅
Men are lucky we don't bite off their heads after mating.

945
01:04:31,684 --> 01:04:34,653
实际上象蜘蛛什么的会那样做
Certain insects do that, like spiders and stuff?

946
01:04:34,854 --> 01:04:37,254
能活着还有什么可抱怨的呢?
We let you live. What are you complaining about?

947
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:41,085
你这是危言耸听,话里有话
See, you're officially kidding. But there's something to that.

948
01:04:41,293 --> 01:04:43,420
你一直在强调某些观点
You keep bringing stuff like that up.

949
01:04:44,063 --> 01:04:47,464
不,没有,等一等,说正经的
No, no. Wait a minute. Talking seriously here.

950
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:50,567
我是说,我一直觉得...
I mean, I always feel this pressure of being...

951
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:53,398
...做一个坚强独立的女人,
...a strong and independent icon of womanhood...

952
01:04:53,606 --> 01:04:55,631
...不让自己的全部生活围着哪个男人转,
...and not making it look like...

953
01:04:55,841 --> 01:04:58,935
...有很大压力
...my whole life is revolving around some guy.

954
01:05:00,513 --> 01:05:01,844
但是爱一个人...
But loving someone...

955
01:05:02,047 --> 01:05:05,483
...与被人爱对我来说意义重大
...and being loved means so much to me.

956
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,484
我常拿这类事情说笑...
I always make fun of it and stuff...

957
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:11,513
...可并非我们做的每件事...
...but isn't everything we do in life...

958
01:05:11,724 --> 01:05:14,591
...都能赢得更多的爱
...a way to be loved a little more?

959
01:05:18,964 --> 01:05:20,261
我不知道
I don't know.

960
01:05:20,699 --> 01:05:22,633
有时候我梦想着...
Sometimes I dream...

961
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:25,861
...做一个好父亲好丈夫
...about being a good father and a good husband.

962
01:05:26,071 --> 01:05:28,539
而且有时候会觉得很接近了
And sometimes it feels really close.

963
01:05:29,208 --> 01:05:31,108
可另外一些时候...
But then other times...

964
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:34,203
...这想法似乎很蠢
...it seems silly...

965
01:05:34,413 --> 01:05:35,880
...仿佛它会
...like it would...

966
01:05:36,248 --> 01:05:38,045
...毁掉我全部的生活
...ruin my whole life.

967
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:41,880
不是由于对责任感的畏惧...
And it's not just a fear of commitment...

968
01:05:42,087 --> 01:05:45,215
...或是没有能力去关爱,因为
...or that I'm incapable of caring or loving because...

969
01:05:45,424 --> 01:05:46,652
...我能胜任
...I can.

970
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:51,690
如果我绝对公正地对待自己...
It's just that, if I'm totally honest with myself...

971
01:05:51,964 --> 01:05:53,625
...那我宁死也不想知道...
...I think I'd rather die knowing...

972
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:56,358
...我擅长些什么
...that I was really good at something.

973
01:05:56,569 --> 01:05:59,402
比起仅仅维系一份...
That I had excelled in some way...

974
01:05:59,638 --> 01:06:01,538
...良好的, 友爱的关系来说,
...than that I'd just been in...

975
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:05,039
... 我还有哪些方面更突出
...a nice, caring relationship.

976
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:14,651
我曾为一个老人工作,有次他告诉我...
I had worked for this older man, and once he told me...

977
01:06:14,854 --> 01:06:18,517
...他把一生的心思都放在了事业上
...that he had spent all of his life thinking about his career.

978
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,022
52岁时他突然地发现...
He was 52, and it suddenly struck him...

979
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,891
...他从没为自己做过任何事
...that he had never really given anything of himself.

980
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,665
他这辈子毫无作为
His life was for no one and nothing.

981
01:06:28,968 --> 01:06:31,300
他说这话时都要哭了
He was almost crying saying that.

982
01:06:34,306 --> 01:06:36,774
我相信如果有神存在...
I believe if there's any kind of God...

983
01:06:36,976 --> 01:06:38,967
...不会存在于任何人身上
...it wouldn't be in any of us...

984
01:06:39,278 --> 01:06:41,178
...不会是你或者我
...not you or me...

985
01:06:41,947 --> 01:06:45,075
...而是存在于这小小的空间之中
...but just this little space in between.

986
01:06:47,553 --> 01:06:50,113
如果世上有什么奇迹...
If there's any kind of magic in this world...

987
01:06:50,322 --> 01:06:54,725
...一定是尽力理解某个人, 并与之同甘共苦
...it must be in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something.

988
01:06:56,996 --> 01:07:00,295
我知道,这几乎是不可能成功的
I know, it's almost impossible to succeed...

989
01:07:01,133 --> 01:07:02,862
...可谁真正在乎呢?
...but who cares really?

990
01:07:03,969 --> 01:07:06,403
答案一定是在尝试之中
The answer must be in the attempt.

991
01:08:14,873 --> 01:08:18,639
我想文明正在衰亡,看看这服务吧
I think this is a civilization in decline. Look at the service.

992
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:22,280
侍者在哪?在纽约她肯定得失业
Where is the waitress? In New York, she'd be out of a job.

993
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:33,551
我来给巴黎的一个朋友打电话
I'm gonna call my friend in Paris...

994
01:08:33,726 --> 01:08:36,854
...我想约她午休时一起吃饭
...who I'm supposed to have lunch with in eight hours.

995
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:46,298
接电话
Pick up.

996
01:08:46,505 --> 01:08:48,439
-接电话啊 -好的
-Pick up the phone. -All right.

997
01:09:01,487 --> 01:09:05,389
我正学英语,你说英语行吗?当作消遣
I've been working on my English. You wanna talk in English, for laughs?

998
01:09:05,824 --> 01:09:08,224
行,这主意不错
Yeah, okay. That's a good idea.

999
01:09:09,962 --> 01:09:13,454
我今天不能陪你吃午饭了,对不起
I don't think I'll be able to make it for lunch today.

1000
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:18,866
我在火车上认识了一个人, 和他在维也纳下了车
I met a guy on the train, and I got off with him in vienna.

1001
01:09:19,104 --> 01:09:21,095
你疯了吗?
Are you crazy?

1002
01:09:22,141 --> 01:09:23,540
也许吧
Probably.

1003
01:09:24,009 --> 01:09:27,035
-他是不是奥地利人? -不,不是
-He's Austrian? He's from there? -No, No.

1004
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:30,943
是个游客,美国人,明天一早就要回家
He's passing through. He's American. He's going back home tomorrow.

1005
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:32,515
你为什么下车?
Why'd you get off?

1006
01:09:33,719 --> 01:09:36,153
他说服了我
Well, he convinced me.

1007
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:40,855
实际上我在火车上和他聊过一阵之后...
I mean, actually, I was ready to get off the train with him...

1008
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,028
...就打算和他一起下车
...after talking to him a short while.

1009
01:09:43,228 --> 01:09:45,253
他很有趣,让我情不自禁
He was so sweet, I couldn't help it.

1010
01:09:46,665 --> 01:09:49,099
在休息车厢,他谈到...
In the lounge car, he began to talk about...

1011
01:09:49,301 --> 01:09:52,395
...他小时候见过他曾祖母的鬼魂
...him as a boy seeing his great-grandmother's ghost.

1012
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:56,002
我就是那时被他吸引住了
I think that's when I fell for him.

1013
01:09:57,109 --> 01:10:00,943
就因为一个小男孩和他所有的美丽梦想
Just the idea of this little boy with all those beautiful dreams.

1014
01:10:02,414 --> 01:10:04,041
他征服了我
He trapped me.

1015
01:10:07,252 --> 01:10:08,947
而且他很可爱
And he's so cute.

1016
01:10:09,154 --> 01:10:11,315
他有漂亮的蓝眼睛...
He has beautiful blue eyes...

1017
01:10:11,523 --> 01:10:13,514
...漂亮的粉红色嘴唇...
...nice pink lips...

1018
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:15,951
...油腻的头发
...greasy hair.

1019
01:10:16,662 --> 01:10:18,254
我很喜欢
I love it.

1020
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:21,463
他高高的个子,有点笨拙
He's kind of tall, and he's a little clumsy.

1021
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:25,569
我喜欢他偷偷看我的感觉
I like to feel his eyes on me when I look away.

1022
01:10:30,275 --> 01:10:33,369
他接吻时象个青涩少年,很可爱
He kind of kisses like an adolescent. It's so cute.

1023
01:10:33,579 --> 01:10:37,140
-不是吧? -就是,我们接过吻,感觉非常棒
-What? -Yeah, we kissed. It was so adorable.

1024
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:41,177
随着夜色降临,我越来越喜欢他
As the night went on, I began to like him more and more.

1025
01:10:43,021 --> 01:10:44,648
我担心他有点怕我
I'm afraid he's scared of me.

1026
01:10:44,857 --> 01:10:48,816
我跟他说过一个女人想杀死前男友的故事
I told him the story about the woman that kills her ex-boyfriend.

1027
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:50,795
他肯定怕得要命
He must be scared to death.

1028
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:54,261
他一定以为我是个专横歹毒的女人
He must be thinking I'm this manipulative, mean woman.

1029
01:10:56,535 --> 01:10:59,026
但愿他不会这样认为
I just hope he doesn't feel that way about me.

1030
01:10:59,238 --> 01:11:02,207
因为,你了解我,我决不会伤害别人
Because, you know me, I'm the most harmless person.

1031
01:11:03,709 --> 01:11:06,610
唯一能真正伤害的只有我自己
The only person I could really hurt is myself.

1032
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,413
我不认为他会怕你
I don't think he's scared of you.

1033
01:11:09,615 --> 01:11:11,446
我想他对你很着迷
I think he's crazy about you.

1034
01:11:12,084 --> 01:11:14,177
-真的? -我认识你很久了
-Really? -I've known you a long time.

1035
01:11:14,386 --> 01:11:16,854
对你印象很好,你还会再见他吗?
I got a good feeling. You gonna see him again?

1036
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:22,059
我们还没提到这个问题
We haven't talked about that yet.

1037
01:11:26,732 --> 01:11:29,428
好,到你了,打电话给你的朋友
Okay, it's your turn. You call your friend.

1038
01:11:29,635 --> 01:11:31,535
好的,好的
All right, all right.

1039
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:37,465
通常只能接通他的答录机
I usually get this guy's answering machine.

1040
01:11:40,179 --> 01:11:41,806
嘿,哥儿们,什么事?
Hi, dude. What's up?

1041
01:11:43,749 --> 01:11:46,582
弗兰克,过得怎样?真高兴你在家
Hey, Frank. How you been? I'm glad you're home.

1042
01:11:46,785 --> 01:11:48,218
挺好,是的
Cool. Yeah.

1043
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:49,978
马德里怎么样?
So how was Madrid?

1044
01:11:50,656 --> 01:11:52,749
没劲透了
Madrid sucked.

1045
01:11:53,425 --> 01:11:56,087
莉莎和我总算彻底玩完了
Lisa and I had our long overdue meltdown.

1046
01:11:56,628 --> 01:11:58,528
太糟了,我早说过不是吗?
Too bad. I told you, no?

1047
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:01,893
对,相隔太远从不会有结果
Yeah, yeah. The long-distance thing just never works.

1048
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,125
我只在马德里呆了几天
I was only in Madrid for a couple days.

1049
01:12:04,336 --> 01:12:06,998
我买了张最便宜的机票
I got a cheaper flight out of vienna.

1050
01:12:09,007 --> 01:12:12,238
实际上并不太便宜,只不过...
You know, it really wasn't that much cheaper. I just....

1051
01:12:12,444 --> 01:12:16,676
我不能马上回家,我不想见到任何熟人
I couldn't go home right away. I didn't want to see anybody I knew.

1052
01:12:16,882 --> 01:12:19,646
只想变成完全不为人知的游魂
I just wanted to be a ghost, completely anonymous.

1053
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,651
你现在还好吧?
So are you okay now?

1054
01:12:22,855 --> 01:12:25,881
对,我很好,很好,真的
Yeah. I'm great. I'm great. That's the thing.

1055
01:12:26,491 --> 01:12:27,458
我很开心
I'm rapturous.

1056
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,650
告诉你是为什么
And I'll tell you why.

1057
01:12:29,862 --> 01:12:32,763
在欧洲最后一晚我认识了一个人
I met somebody on my last night in Europe.

1058
01:12:32,965 --> 01:12:35,661
-难以置信 -我知道,我知道
-That's incredible. -I know, I know.

1059
01:12:35,868 --> 01:12:39,235
有句老话说我们是对方的魔鬼和天使
You know how they say we're all each other's demons and angels?

1060
01:12:40,272 --> 01:12:43,639
她无疑是波提且利画笔下的天使
Well, she was literally a Botticelli angel...

1061
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,468
...告诉我一切都会好起来
...telling me everything would be okay.

1062
01:12:49,481 --> 01:12:50,641
你们怎么认识的?
How did you meet?

1063
01:12:52,251 --> 01:12:53,718
是在火车上
On the train.

1064
01:12:54,186 --> 01:12:57,349
她邻座的一对古怪夫妻在吵架
She was sitting next to a weird couple that was fighting...

1065
01:12:57,556 --> 01:13:00,719
...她换座时正好坐在过道对面
...so she moved. She sat right across the aisle from me.

1066
01:13:00,926 --> 01:13:02,860
于是我们开始聊天
So we started to talk.

1067
01:13:03,061 --> 01:13:05,256
起初她不太喜欢我
She didn't like me much at first.

1068
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:06,624
她非常聪明...
She's super smart...

1069
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:09,529
...充满激情...
...very passionate...

1070
01:13:10,102 --> 01:13:11,296
...而且很漂亮
...and beautiful.

1071
01:13:12,838 --> 01:13:15,329
我却太缺乏自信
And I was so unsure of myself.

1072
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,371
我觉得我说的话都很蠢
I thought everything I said sounded so stupid.

1073
01:13:20,245 --> 01:13:23,271
哦,伙计,这我并不担心
Oh, man. I wouldn't worry about that.

1074
01:13:23,882 --> 01:13:26,146
她不会因此而对你有成见
No, I'm sure she was not judging you.

1075
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:28,950
再说了,她坐到了你旁边
No, and by the way, she sat next to you.

1076
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:30,883
我相信她是有意如此
I'm sure she did it on purpose.

1077
01:13:31,089 --> 01:13:32,420
哦,是吗?
Oh, yeah?

1078
01:13:36,194 --> 01:13:39,994
我们男人太蠢了,一点也不了解女人
Us men are so stupid. We don't understand anything about women.

1079
01:13:41,266 --> 01:13:43,757
她们行为古怪,我只知道这一点
They act strange, the little I know of them.

1080
01:13:44,369 --> 01:13:45,666
对不对?
Don't they?

1081
01:13:52,711 --> 01:13:56,613
我觉得我们象是处在梦境之中
I feel like this is some dream world we're in.

1082
01:13:56,815 --> 01:13:58,407
对,这很奇怪
Yeah, it's so weird.

1083
01:13:58,817 --> 01:14:01,012
仿佛我们在一起的时间只属于我们
It's like our time together is just ours.

1084
01:14:01,219 --> 01:14:03,050
是我们自己创造的
It's our own creation.

1085
01:14:03,789 --> 01:14:06,815
就象我在你梦里,你在我梦里
It must be like I'm in your dream and you're in mine.

1086
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:10,992
所以这一整夜才会如此美妙...
And what's so cool is that this whole evening...

1087
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:14,688
...客观地说我们本来是不会在一起的
...all our time together, shouldn't officially be happening.

1088
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:18,358
我明白,所以才会感觉象在童话世界
Yeah, I know. Maybe that's why this feels so otherworldly.

1089
01:14:20,472 --> 01:14:24,067
不过天亮之后我们就会变回南瓜,对不对?
But then the morning comes and we turn into pumpkins, right?

1090
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:26,243
我明白
I know.

1091
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:30,177
但是现在,你该拿出玻璃鞋...
But now, you're supposed to produce the glass slipper...

1092
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:31,974
...看看合不合适
...and see if it fits.

1093
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,485
会合适的
It'll fit.

1094
01:14:55,007 --> 01:14:56,702
我有个朋友的孩子是在家里出生的,
This friend of mine had a kkid...

1095
01:14:56,908 --> 01:15:00,139
...所以他在那帮忙
...and it was a home birth, so he was there helping out.

1096
01:15:00,345 --> 01:15:03,143
他说生命降生之时的意义非凡
But he said at that profound moment of birth...

1097
01:15:04,616 --> 01:15:08,382
...他看着他的孩子第一次体验生命
...he was watching his child experiencing life for the first time...

1098
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:10,521
...试着第一次呼吸
...trying to take its first breath.

1099
01:15:10,722 --> 01:15:14,249
他能想到的却只是眼前这个生命...
All he could think about was that he was looking at something...

1100
01:15:14,459 --> 01:15:16,484
...总有一天会死去
...that was gonna die someday.

1101
01:15:16,828 --> 01:15:18,921
他无法驱散这个念头
He couldn't get it out of his head.

1102
01:15:19,664 --> 01:15:23,259
我觉得很真实,一切事物都是有限的
And I think that's so true. Everything is so finite.

1103
01:15:23,535 --> 01:15:26,299
你是否觉得正因为这样...
But don't you think that's what...

1104
01:15:26,505 --> 01:15:29,838
...才使我们的时间和特殊时刻如此重要?
...makes our time and specific moments so important?

1105
01:15:30,042 --> 01:15:30,906
是的,我明白
Yeah, I know.

1106
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:33,437
就象我们今晚一样
It's the same for us tonight, though.

1107
01:15:36,415 --> 01:15:40,078
过了明天,我们也许永远都不会再见面
After tomorrow, we'll probably never see each other again, right?

1108
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:44,215
你不认为我们还能见面?
You don't think we'll ever see each other?

1109
01:15:46,892 --> 01:15:48,154
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

1110
01:15:54,499 --> 01:15:56,023
老实说,我不知道
Actually, I don't know.

1111
01:15:57,102 --> 01:15:58,330
我没有别的计划
I hadn't planned another--

1112
01:15:58,537 --> 01:16:02,098
我也是,我在巴黎,你在美国,我能理解
Me too. I live in Paris, you live in the U.S. I understand.

1113
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:05,071
我不想让你来,你讨厌飞行不是吗?
I'd hate to make you fly. You'd hate to fly, right?

1114
01:16:05,444 --> 01:16:07,503
我并不那么害怕飞行
I'm not so scared of flying.

1115
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:09,404
我是说我可以
I mean, I could.

1116
01:16:09,614 --> 01:16:11,309
是吗,如果你想...
Well, if you were gonna...

1117
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:13,107
...来美国...
...come to the U.S...

1118
01:16:13,351 --> 01:16:14,750
...或者,也许我...
...or if, you know, if l....

1119
01:16:14,953 --> 01:16:17,387
我是说,我可以再来这
I mean, I could come back here.

1120
01:16:18,457 --> 01:16:19,617
怎么了?
What?

1121
01:16:20,459 --> 01:16:23,690
我们该以成年人的理性来对待这事
No, let's just be rational adults about this.

1122
01:16:26,631 --> 01:16:28,326
我们该尝试不同的方式
We should try something different.

1123
01:16:28,533 --> 01:16:31,764
就算今晚是我们仅有的一晚也不错不是吗?
It's not so bad if tonight is our only night, right?

1124
01:16:33,071 --> 01:16:34,971
大家交换电话,住址
People exchange numbers, addresses.

1125
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:38,006
结果只通过一两封信,一两次电话
They end up writing once, calling each other twice.

1126
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:39,973
是的,结果很糟
Right. Fizzles out.

1127
01:16:40,278 --> 01:16:42,769
我不想那样,我讨厌那样
Yeah, I don't want that. I hate that.

1128
01:16:43,782 --> 01:16:45,374
我也讨厌那样
I hate that too.

1129
01:16:45,984 --> 01:16:49,283
为什么大家都认为关系应该永远保持呢?
Why does everybody think relationships should last forever?

1130
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:51,614
是啊,为什么?真蠢
Yeah, why? It's stupid.

1131
01:16:53,425 --> 01:16:56,019
你觉得今晚就是...
But you think tonight's it?

1132
01:16:56,294 --> 01:16:59,786
我是指,这就是我们仅有的一晚吗?
I mean, that tonight's our only night?

1133
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,859
只能这样不是吗?
It's the only way, no?

1134
01:17:06,972 --> 01:17:08,303
那好吧
Well, all right.

1135
01:17:09,841 --> 01:17:11,103
就这样
Let's do it.

1136
01:17:11,443 --> 01:17:13,775
不欺骗,不猜忌
No delusions, no projections.

1137
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:17,171
只管把今晚过好
We'll just make tonight great.

1138
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:21,079
好,就这么办
Let's do that.

1139
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:40,800
我们应该握握手
We should do some kind of handshake.

1140
01:17:41,273 --> 01:17:42,535
把手给我
Give me your hand.

1141
01:17:46,011 --> 01:17:48,946
为了我们唯一一个...
To our one and only...

1142
01:17:49,781 --> 01:17:51,271
...共处的夜晚...
...night together...

1143
01:17:52,017 --> 01:17:54,577
...以及余下的时间
...and the hours that remain.

1144
01:18:03,195 --> 01:18:04,219
怎么了?
What?

1145
01:18:07,032 --> 01:18:08,329
这真是...
It's just....

1146
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:10,497
令人沮丧是不是?
It's depressing, no?

1147
01:18:11,503 --> 01:18:14,267
此刻我们唯一要想的就是...
Now, the only thing we're gonna think of is...

1148
01:18:14,472 --> 01:18:16,406
...我们必须说再见的时刻
...when we'll have to say goodbye.

1149
01:18:17,209 --> 01:18:20,201
可以现在就说,那样就不用担心了
We could say goodbye now. Then we won't worry about it.

1150
01:18:20,612 --> 01:18:21,738
现在?
Now?

1151
01:18:22,547 --> 01:18:23,707
说再见
Say goodbye.

1152
01:18:23,915 --> 01:18:25,405
-再见 -再见
-Bye. -Goodbye.

1153
01:18:26,985 --> 01:18:27,952
再见
Au revoir.

1154
01:18:28,153 --> 01:18:29,916
-再见 -再见
-Later. -Later, yeah.

1155
01:19:00,252 --> 01:19:01,310
这样好了
Here's the plan.

1156
01:19:01,519 --> 01:19:04,818
你去偷杯子,我去弄酒
You're gonna grab the glasses, and I'm gonna get the wine.

1157
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:07,018
-红酒 -红酒,行
-Red wine. -Red wine. Right.

1158
01:19:07,225 --> 01:19:10,353
-你觉得能弄到吗? -别担心
-You think you can do that? -No problem.

1159
01:19:15,166 --> 01:19:17,430
-祝我好运 -祝你好运
-Wish me luck. -Good luck.

1160
01:19:19,371 --> 01:19:20,497
你好
Hello.

1161
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,307
你会说英语吗?
Do you speak English?

1162
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:28,570
-会一点 -会一点是吗?
-A bit. -Yeah? A bit?

1163
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:31,408
我有件棘手的事...
I'm having kind of an odd situation...

1164
01:19:31,616 --> 01:19:33,413
...是这样....
...which is that....

1165
01:19:33,752 --> 01:19:35,686
看到那边那女孩了吗?
You see that girl over there?

1166
01:19:40,091 --> 01:19:42,559
这是我们在一起的唯一一晚
Well, this is our only night together...

1167
01:19:43,228 --> 01:19:44,752
...而她...
...and she....

1168
01:19:46,831 --> 01:19:50,130
问题在于她想要瓶红酒...
The problem is that she wants a bottle of red wine...

1169
01:19:50,335 --> 01:19:52,496
...可是我身无分文
...and I don't have any money.

1170
01:19:54,906 --> 01:19:57,374
我想你也许能...
But I was thinking that you might want to...

1171
01:19:58,410 --> 01:20:01,971
...给我这家酒吧的地址,我保证...
...give me the address of this bar, and I would promise...

1172
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:05,816
...寄钱给你,而你能成全我们这一夜
...to send you the money, and you'd be making our night complete.

1173
01:20:06,017 --> 01:20:07,951
-你会寄钱给我? -是的
You would send me the money?

1174
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:15,321
你保证?
Your hand?

1175
01:20:31,509 --> 01:20:33,875
敬你一生中最美好的夜晚
For the greatest night in your life.

1176
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:35,774
太感谢你了
Thank you very much.

1177
01:20:59,471 --> 01:21:03,066
我经常和别人一起分享美好时刻...
So often I've been with people and shared beautiful moments...

1178
01:21:03,274 --> 01:21:07,335
...例如旅游或彻夜不眠等着看日出
...like traveling or staying up all night and watching the sunrise.

1179
01:21:08,213 --> 01:21:10,773
我知道那都是特别的时刻
And I knew those were special moments.

1180
01:21:11,383 --> 01:21:13,613
但总有不如意的地方
But something was always wrong.

1181
01:21:14,753 --> 01:21:16,983
我希望是和另外的人在一起
I wished I'd been with someone else.

1182
01:21:18,757 --> 01:21:20,918
我知道那种感觉...
I knew that what I was feeling...

1183
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:25,187
...实际上对我很重要,他们不会明白
...exactly what was so important to me, they didn't understand.

1184
01:21:29,868 --> 01:21:31,859
但我很高兴和你在一起
But I'm happy to be with you.

1185
01:21:34,606 --> 01:21:37,074
你不会知道为什么这样一夜...
You couldn't know why a night like this...

1186
01:21:37,275 --> 01:21:39,766
...对我的生活来说有多重要
...is so important to my life right now...

1187
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:41,377
...但确实重要
...but it is.

1188
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:46,450
这是个美妙的早晨
This is a great morning.

1189
01:21:47,018 --> 01:21:48,781
是个美妙的早晨
It is a great morning.

1190
01:21:51,089 --> 01:21:53,387
你觉得我们可以更进一步吗?
Do you think we have others like this?

1191
01:21:56,361 --> 01:21:59,489
那我们的理性和成年人的决定怎么办?
What about our rational, adult decision?

1192
01:21:59,697 --> 01:22:01,358
哦，嗯
Oh, yeah.

1193
01:22:05,737 --> 01:22:08,968
我明白你说的 希望的人不在是指什么
I know what you mean about wishing somebody wasn't there.

1194
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:11,942
通常,我自己...
It's just, usually, it's myself...

1195
01:22:12,143 --> 01:22:14,304
...会希望可以远远躲开
...that I wish I could get away from.

1196
01:22:14,946 --> 01:22:16,846
说真的,想想看
Seriously, think about this.

1197
01:22:17,348 --> 01:22:19,578
我从没去过任何...
I have never been anywhere...

1198
01:22:19,784 --> 01:22:21,479
...我没去过的地方
...that I haven't been.

1199
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,352
从没有一个吻...
I've never had a kiss...

1200
01:22:24,556 --> 01:22:26,581
...是我没有吻过的
...when I wasn't one of the kissers.

1201
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:28,656
从没有...
You know, I've never...

1202
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:32,091
...看过我不在场时看过的电影
...gone to the movies when I wasn't there in the audience.

1203
01:22:32,297 --> 01:22:34,891
从没打过我没参与的保龄球
I've never been out bowling if I wasn't there...

1204
01:22:35,099 --> 01:22:36,657
...制造一些愚蠢的笑话
...making some stupid joke.

1205
01:22:36,868 --> 01:22:39,769
所以才会有那么多人讨厌自己,真的
That's why so many people hate themselves. Seriously.

1206
01:22:39,971 --> 01:22:42,098
他们渴望死亡...
It's just, they are sick to death...

1207
01:22:42,307 --> 01:22:44,571
...徘徊在自己周围
...of being around themselves.

1208
01:22:45,343 --> 01:22:49,040
如果我们一直呆在一起
Let's say that you and l were together all the time.

1209
01:22:49,247 --> 01:22:51,477
你会开始讨厌我的坏习惯
You'd start to hate a lot of my mannerisms.

1210
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:53,414
包括...
The way...

1211
01:22:53,618 --> 01:22:56,849
...每次我们有客人来访...
...the way every time that we would have people over...

1212
01:22:57,455 --> 01:23:00,686
...我变得不可靠,我喝过了头
...I'd be insecure, and I'd get a little too drunk.

1213
01:23:01,493 --> 01:23:05,259
或是我反复讲些愚蠢,自作聪明的故事...
Or the way I tell the same stupid, pseudo-intellectual story...

1214
01:23:05,463 --> 01:23:07,226
...翻来覆去地说...
...again and again.

1215
01:23:08,967 --> 01:23:11,128
那些故事我都听过...
You see, I've heard all those stories...

1216
01:23:11,402 --> 01:23:14,030
...所以我当然会厌恶自己
...so of course I'm sick of myself.

1217
01:23:18,176 --> 01:23:19,666
但和你在一起...
But being with you...

1218
01:23:21,913 --> 01:23:24,575
...让我觉得自己象是另一个人
...it's made me feel like I was somebody else.

1219
01:23:26,184 --> 01:23:30,280
象这样能让人忘我的其他方法只有...
I mean, the only other way to lose yourself like that is...

1220
01:23:31,155 --> 01:23:33,385
...你也知道,跳舞...
...you know, dancing...

1221
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:35,692
...酒精...
...or alcohol...

1222
01:23:36,327 --> 01:23:39,194
...毒品,诸如此类
...or drugs, or stuff like that.

1223
01:23:41,733 --> 01:23:42,995
做爱?
Fucking.

1224
01:23:44,235 --> 01:23:47,398
作爱,对,也是方法之一
Fucking, yeah. That's one way.

1225
01:24:01,753 --> 01:24:03,516
知道我想要什么吗?
Do you know what I want?

1226
01:24:04,722 --> 01:24:06,019
什么?
What?

1227
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,952
有人吻我
To be kissed.

1228
01:24:14,265 --> 01:24:15,892
这我能做到
Well, I could do that.

1229
01:24:29,881 --> 01:24:30,939
等等
Wait.

1230
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,185
我得说几句傻话
I have to say something stupid.

1231
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:39,847
没问题
All right.

1232
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:42,953
非常傻
It's very stupid.

1233
01:24:46,097 --> 01:24:48,258
我觉得我们不该发生关系
I don't think we should sleep together.

1234
01:24:50,602 --> 01:24:55,062
我很想,但以后我们永远都不会再见面
I want to, but since we're never going to see each other again...

1235
01:24:55,273 --> 01:24:57,173
...这让我很难受
...it'll make me feel bad.

1236
01:24:58,076 --> 01:25:00,806
我会猜你和谁在一起,会想你
I'll wonder who else you're with. I'll miss you.

1237
01:25:06,217 --> 01:25:08,685
我知道,这不太成熟
I know. It's not very adult.

1238
01:25:08,886 --> 01:25:11,753
也许是女人的天性,我控制不住
Maybe it's a female thing. I can't help it.

1239
01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:14,121
那我们就再见面
Let's see each other again.

1240
01:25:16,861 --> 01:25:20,854
我不希望你为了和我作爱而破坏约定
No, I don't want you to break our vow just so you can get laid.

1241
01:25:21,399 --> 01:25:25,335
我不只是想,而是--我是说...
I don't want to just get laid. I want to-- I mean....

1242
01:25:25,803 --> 01:25:27,964
我觉得我们应该作爱
I mean, I think we should.

1243
01:25:29,073 --> 01:25:31,234
我们早上就会死去不是吗?
We die in the morning, right?

1244
01:25:32,644 --> 01:25:35,579
-所以应该 -那就象男人的梦想
-I think we should. -Then it's like some male fantasy.

1245
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:38,977
邂逅一个法国女郎,干了她然后永不再见
Meet a French girl, fuck her and never see her again.

1246
01:25:39,183 --> 01:25:42,778
而且有个好故事可说了,我可不想...
And have this great story to tell. I don't want...

1247
01:25:42,987 --> 01:25:45,717
...这个美好的夜晚变成那样
...this great evening to just have been for that.

1248
01:25:46,557 --> 01:25:50,084
好的,我们不用作爱,那没什么大不了
Okay, we don't have to have sex. It's not a big deal.

1249
01:26:00,972 --> 01:26:02,940
你不想再见到我?
You don't want to see me again?

1250
01:26:04,375 --> 01:26:05,637
不,我当然想
No, of course I do.

1251
01:26:05,843 --> 01:26:08,437
如果现在有人让我选择...
If somebody gave me the choice right now...

1252
01:26:08,646 --> 01:26:11,547
...永远不再见你还是娶你
...of to never see you again or to marry you...

1253
01:26:11,783 --> 01:26:12,875
...我会娶你
...I would marry you.

1254
01:26:13,084 --> 01:26:15,245
也许是所谓的浪漫过头
Maybe that's a lot of romantic bullshit...

1255
01:26:15,453 --> 01:26:18,183
但有人结婚的理由比这更少
...but people have gotten married for a lot less.

1256
01:26:21,626 --> 01:26:22,456
事实上...
Actually...

1257
01:26:24,462 --> 01:26:29,195
...我们下火车时我决定要和你睡觉
...I think I decided I wanted to sleep with you when we got off the train.

1258
01:26:32,837 --> 01:26:35,738
聊了这么多之后我拿不定主意了
Now that we've talked so much, I don't know anymore.

1259
01:26:46,584 --> 01:26:48,916
我们干嘛把一切变得这么复杂?
Why do we make everything so complicated?

1260
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,610
我不知道
I don't know.

1261
01:27:52,416 --> 01:27:56,147
回到巴黎你首先想要做什么?
What's the first thing you'll do when you get back to Paris?

1262
01:27:56,621 --> 01:27:58,179
给父母打电话
Call my parents.

1263
01:27:58,422 --> 01:27:59,787
你呢?
What about you?

1264
01:28:00,124 --> 01:28:04,254
不知道,也许会去拿狗,它在我朋友那
I don't know. I'll probably go pick up my dog. He's with a friend.

1265
01:28:04,462 --> 01:28:05,895
你有只狗?我喜欢狗
You have a dog? I love dogs.

1266
01:28:06,097 --> 01:28:07,724
-是吗? -是的
-You do? -Yeah.

1267
01:28:08,065 --> 01:28:09,965
-哦,该死 -怎么了?
-Oh, shit. -What?

1268
01:28:11,002 --> 01:28:13,562
说不清,我们回到现实中来了
I don't know. We're back in real time.

1269
01:28:13,971 --> 01:28:15,666
是的,令我讨厌
I know. I hate that.

1270
01:28:16,007 --> 01:28:17,304
是什么?
What is that?

1271
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:21,402
听起来象古钢琴
Sounds like a harpsichord.

1272
01:28:21,879 --> 01:28:23,506
去看看
Check that out.

1273
01:28:23,881 --> 01:28:25,678
有人在演奏
Somebody's playing.

1274
01:28:32,456 --> 01:28:33,480
真酷
That's cool.

1275
01:28:52,076 --> 01:28:54,340
我们能随着琴声起舞吗?
Can we dance to the harpsichord?

1276
01:28:54,545 --> 01:28:55,910
当然
Of course.

1277
01:29:01,051 --> 01:29:01,975
怎么?
Oh, wow.

1278
01:29:05,189 --> 01:29:06,850
我要拍下你的照片
I'm gonna take your picture...

1279
01:29:08,125 --> 01:29:10,116
...那就永远不会忘记你...
...so I never forget you...

1280
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:13,692
...和这一切
...or all this.

1281
01:29:14,465 --> 01:29:16,092
好的,我也一样
Okay, me too.

1282
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:17,950
"岁月会象兔子一样溜走"
"The years shall run like rabbits."

1283
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:21,624
什么?
What?

1284
01:30:23,701 --> 01:30:25,032
没什么
Nothing.

1285
01:30:26,938 --> 01:30:28,701
我有张唱片...
I have...

1286
01:30:29,206 --> 01:30:31,367
...是戴伦.托马斯...
...this recording of Dylan Thomas...

1287
01:30:31,642 --> 01:30:33,633
...朗诵W.H.奥登的诗
...reading a W. H. Auden poem.

1288
01:30:33,844 --> 01:30:36,506
他有副好嗓子
He's got a great voice.

1289
01:30:38,449 --> 01:30:39,643
比如...
It's like....

1290
01:30:40,985 --> 01:30:43,180
"城里所有时钟
"All the clocks in the city

1291
01:30:43,387 --> 01:30:46,185
"开始当当响着报时
Began to whirr and chime:

1292
01:30:46,424 --> 01:30:48,915
"不要让时间欺骗你
'O let not Time deceive you

1293
01:30:49,126 --> 01:30:51,720
"你不可能征服时间
You cannot conquer Time.

1294
01:30:52,063 --> 01:30:54,156
"在烦恼与忧虑之中
In headaches and in worry

1295
01:30:54,498 --> 01:30:57,399
"朦胧的生活消逝无踪
vaguely life leaks away

1296
01:30:57,601 --> 01:30:59,831
"时间占有了他的幻想
And Time will have his fancy

1297
01:31:00,037 --> 01:31:02,631
"明天或是今天"
Tomorrow or today.' "

1298
01:31:03,207 --> 01:31:04,834
就象这样
Something like that.

1299
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:07,004
不错
That's good.

1300
01:31:14,618 --> 01:31:18,486
你说过在最初的几年之后...
When you talked earlier about after a few years...

1301
01:31:18,689 --> 01:31:21,317
...一对夫妻怎样开始彼此厌恶...
...how a couple would begin to hate each other...

1302
01:31:21,525 --> 01:31:23,493
...由于彼此太了解...
...by anticipating their reactions...

1303
01:31:23,694 --> 01:31:25,719
...或是厌倦了对方的恶习
...or getting tired of their mannerisms.

1304
01:31:26,464 --> 01:31:28,830
我觉得我恰恰相反
I think it would be the opposite for me.

1305
01:31:30,001 --> 01:31:34,335
我彻底了解一个人时就会真正爱上他
I think I can really fall in love when I know everything about someone.

1306
01:31:35,573 --> 01:31:37,234
他怎样梳理头发...
The way he's gonna part his hair...

1307
01:31:37,441 --> 01:31:39,568
...哪一天穿哪件衬衣...
...which shirt he's gonna wear that day...

1308
01:31:39,777 --> 01:31:44,009
...知道在什么场合他会说什么故事
...knowing the exact story he'd tell in a given situation.

1309
01:31:45,716 --> 01:31:48,241
这时候我肯定就爱上他了
I'm sure that's when I know I'm really in love.

1310
01:32:09,907 --> 01:32:12,239
-嘿,糟糕 -怎么了?
-Hey, guess what. -What?

1311
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:14,578
我们没去看那场话剧
We didn't go to those guys' play.

1312
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:16,007
话剧?
Play?

1313
01:32:16,213 --> 01:32:17,544
那头母牛?
The cow?

1314
01:32:17,748 --> 01:32:19,477
是啊,我们没去
Oh, yeah, we didn't.

1315
01:32:19,683 --> 01:32:21,913
哦,不,我们错过了
Oh, no. We missed it.

1316
01:32:47,611 --> 01:32:49,602
你知道去机场的公车吗?
You know what bus to take to the airport?

1317
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:50,712
是的,别担心
No problem.

1318
01:32:50,915 --> 01:32:54,316
-我就上这趟车 -到了,你就上去吗?
-I should get on this one. -Right here. You wanna get on there?

1319
01:32:58,122 --> 01:33:00,056
那就这样了,是吗?
I guess this is it, no?

1320
01:33:01,725 --> 01:33:03,215
我真的...
I really....

1321
01:33:08,599 --> 01:33:10,931
-要知道... -我知道,我也是
-You know.... -Yeah, I know. Me too.

1322
01:33:17,575 --> 01:33:21,067
祝你生活顺利,事事开心
Have a great life. Have fun with everything you're gonna do.

1323
01:33:21,278 --> 01:33:23,644
也祝你学业和一切顺利
Good luck with school and all that.

1324
01:33:25,049 --> 01:33:26,573
我讨厌这样
I hate this.

1325
01:33:27,251 --> 01:33:29,776
我也是,火车就要开了
Me too. The train is about to leave.

1326
01:33:37,595 --> 01:33:40,291
要知道那些都是废话...
You know all this bullshit we're talking about...

1327
01:33:40,498 --> 01:33:43,058
...不再见面?我不愿意
...not seeing each other? I don't want that.

1328
01:33:43,267 --> 01:33:44,461
我也不想
I don't either.

1329
01:33:44,668 --> 01:33:46,226
-你不想? -我就是等这句话
-You don't? -I waited for you to say it.

1330
01:33:46,437 --> 01:33:47,995
你干嘛不说出来?
Why didn't you say something?

我担心你不想再见我

你想怎么做?

太恐怖了,象做社会学试验

你坐火车就行,可我却得飞越重洋
It's a train ride for you, but I gotta fly all the way here.

1346

1
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:49,350
自最后一个国王被赶出罗马城的四百年后
400 years after the last king was driven from the city,

2
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,150
罗马共和国统治着许多民族
the republic of Rome rules many nations,

3
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,380
但自己却内患重重
but cannot rule itself.

4
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,951
罗马城内，普通民众
The city is constantly roiled by conflict

5
00:01:58,011 --> 00:02:01,411
和贵族之间纷争不断
between the common people and the nobility.

6
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:04,981
两位军人，两位老友
Power is shared and order maintained

7
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:07,252
分享着统治权，共同维持着国家的秩序
by two soldiers- old friends--

8
00:02:07,312 --> 00:02:11,652
他们就是…格涅乌斯·庞贝·麦格纳斯和盖乌斯·优利乌斯·恺撒
Gnaeus Pompey Magnus and Gaius Julius Caesar.

9
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:15,752
曾经，庞贝被公认为更有王者风范
Once, Pompey was acknowledged by all to be the greater man,

10
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:19,983
在过去的八年里，庞贝一直维护着罗马的安定和平
but for the last eight years, while Pompey has kept the peace in Rome,

11
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:23,153
但与此同时，恺撒则发动了征服高卢的战争
Caesar has waged a war of conquest in Gaul

12
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:26,113
这场战争让他拥有了更多的财富和人心
that has made him ever more rich and popular.

13
00:02:26,183 --> 00:02:28,414
权力的天平正渐倾斜
The balance of power is shifting,

14
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:31,014
贵族们也渐人心惶惶
and the nobility have grown fearful.

15
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,014
虽然出生贵族血统
Though of noble blood himself,

16
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:35,784
但恺撒却平易近人
Caesar stands with the common people.

17
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:40,055
一个这样的人…兵权在握，金钱在手
A man like that- an aristocrat with soldiers, money

18
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:43,915
又深受人民爱戴的贵族…或许就将成就帝王之业
and the love of the people- might make himself king.

19
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:47,921
波罗，入阵！
Pullo, formation!

20
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,591
波罗！
Pullo!

21
00:03:50,661 --> 00:03:52,721
一字阵！
Single formation!

22
00:03:55,162 --> 00:03:57,592
盾牌掩护！
Shields on me!

23
00:04:12,763 --> 00:04:15,963
回到阵队里面去，你个酒鬼蠢货！
Get back in formation, you drunken fool.

24
00:04:23,224 --> 00:04:26,094
整队！
Reform!

25
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:31,465
兵团士兵泰特斯·波罗，他是第13兵团的英雄
Legionary Titus Pullo is a hero of the 13th legion,

26
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,425
但看看他现在这个样子
but look at him now.

27
00:04:33,495 --> 00:04:36,665
法律面前人人平等
Justice knows every man's number.

28
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:39,626
他犯下了严重的渎圣的罪行
He has committed a terrible sacrilege,

29
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,626
就将用他的性命来偿还！
and he will pay for it with his life!

30
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:47,196
这里的任何人犯了法，也都会象他这样
As will any man here who breaks the law.

31
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:50,627
斗殴者和醉酒者将被施以鞭刑
Brawlers and drunkards will be flogged.

32
00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:53,827
盗窃者将被施以绞刑
Thieves will be strangled.

33
00:04:53,897 --> 00:04:58,397
叛逃者将在十字架上被钉死
Deserters will be crucified.

34
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:07,668
这就完了？
Is that it?

35
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:10,099
我才刚开始享受呢
I was just beginning to enjoy myself.

36
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,430
在你面前是…
Before you...

37
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,870
凯而特人的儿子韦辛格托里克斯
vercingetorix, son of Celtil,

38
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,731
他是阿尔文尼部族的首领
chieftain of the tribe of the Arverni,

39
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:35,371
是依莱西亚要塞反抗者的总指挥
commander of the rebel stronghold of Elysia,

40
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:37,631
高卢人的君王
king of all the Gauls.

41
00:05:38,731 --> 00:05:40,801
你要怎么处治他？
What would you have of him?

42
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:04,274
恺撒！
Caesar!

43
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:06,174
恺撒！
Caesar!

44
00:06:07,704 --> 00:06:11,974
恺撒！恺撒！恺撒！
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

45
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,410
Hey!

46
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:32,836
嘿，外面发生了什么事？
Hey, what's going on?

47
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:35,406
嘿，我叫你呢！
Hey- here!

48
00:06:37,037 --> 00:06:40,107
你个臭婊子养的
You piss-drinking sons of circus whores!

49
00:06:40,177 --> 00:06:43,077
高卢人的首领向恺撒投降了
The chief of the Gauls has surrendered to Caesar.

50
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:44,937
战争结束了
The war is over.

51
00:06:46,277 --> 00:06:48,378
别跟我说这个
Don't say that.

52
00:06:48,838 --> 00:06:50,708
这些士兵们有两天的自由时间
The boys have been given two days liberty

53
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:53,408
洗劫城里的东西，据为己有
to sack the town and take personal spoils.

54
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:55,978
他们都发财了
They'll all be rich.

55
00:06:56,038 --> 00:06:58,079
而我却被关在这里
And me in here!

56
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:06,409
过来，给我进去！
Come on, get in there!

57
00:07:07,609 --> 00:07:09,940
400便士？你疯了吗？
400 denarii? Are you insane?

58
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,610
这只是底价
That's a floor price.

59
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,680
工匠，能生孩子的女人等等，这些我们还是会按老价钱付
We'll pay the usual premium for tradesmen and fertile women, et cetera.

60
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,340
庞贝·麦格纳斯的来信
From Pompey Magnus, sir.

61
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,511
把起价定在800便士左右吧
Set the floor closer to eight.

62
00:07:25,741 --> 00:07:28,841
“我亲爱的朋友和伙伴，盖乌斯
"My dear friend and partner, Gaius,

63
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:30,612
我给你带来了一个可怕的消息”
I have terrible news."

64
00:07:30,682 --> 00:07:33,512
原谅我
Forgive me.

65
00:07:33,582 --> 00:07:35,512
原谅我
Forgive me.

66
00:07:35,582 --> 00:07:38,882
我原谅你，我原谅你
I forgive you. I forgive you.

67
00:07:40,382 --> 00:07:43,113
 对我的奴隶好点  我会的
 Be good to my slaves.  I will.

68
00:07:43,183 --> 00:07:45,043
还有我的父亲
And to my father.

69
00:07:45,113 --> 00:07:46,743
我会的
I will.

70
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:55,084
吻我
Kiss me.

71
00:08:03,245 --> 00:08:04,915
你的头发
Your hair.

72
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:08,445
真有趣
Funny.

73
00:08:27,017 --> 00:08:29,417
这些人不是东部穷苦的农民
This isn't miserable Eastern peasantry.

74
00:08:29,487 --> 00:08:31,587
这些可是高卢国的贵族
This is the creme of the Gallic nations.

75
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:34,117
等市场上这样的货色多了你就卖不出去
A glut on the market. You won't be able to give them away.

76
00:08:34,187 --> 00:08:36,618
 700便士，不要讨价还价了  还送货到马赛去吗？
 Seven, and be done with it.  On delivery to Masilia?

77
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:39,788
 哦，你想得也太美了！  同意，你去负责细节
 Oh, please!  Agreed. See to the details.

78
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:45,148
希望你把那些寄生虫卖了个好价钱
I hope you got a decent price off those parasites.

79
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,889
够不错了
Good enough.

80
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:54,689
有从罗马来的消息？
News from Rome?

81
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,450
庞贝写信来了
Pompey writes.

82
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,720
我女儿朱莉亚死于难产
My daughter Julia has died in childbirth.

83
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:18,221
我和你一起默哀
I grieve with you.

84
00:09:22,192 --> 00:09:24,222
孩子呢？
The child?

85
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:26,722
是个女孩，保住了
Agirl--stillborn.

86
00:09:37,653 --> 00:09:40,724
庞贝需要一位新夫人了
Pompey will be needing a new wife.

87
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,747
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

88
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:54,425
恺撒又运来了更多的从高卢得到的战利品
More of Caesar's spoils from Gaul.

89
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,895
恺撒！恺撒！
Caesar! Caesar!

90
00:10:27,598 --> 00:10:30,728
老百姓高兴的时候搞出来的这些噪音是多可怕啊！
What a dreadful noise plebs make when they're happy.

91
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,058
这可是天籁之音
This is music.

92
00:10:33,128 --> 00:10:37,059
等到恺撒煽动这些平民诛杀我们，他们嚎叫着要我喝我们的血的声音
Wait until Caesar starts them howling for our blood.

93
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:39,459
才会让你觉得真的可怕呢
Then you'll hear something dreadful.

94
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:30,004
凡是把女奴找回来的人
Afine reward isoffered

95
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,104
都将给予重金酬谢
for the return of a slavewoman,

96
00:11:32,164 --> 00:11:38,564
不论这些女奴是被人从马略·多拉倍拉家偷走的还是自己潜逃的
stolen or absconded from the house of Marius Dolabella.

97
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:41,800
在庞贝·麦格纳斯和优利乌斯·恺撒的护卫下
Under the protection of Pompey Magnus

98
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,703
元老院明天会开会
and Julius Caesar, Senate sits tomorrow.

99
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:47,665
请大家注意了！
Be aware!

100
00:11:47,735 --> 00:11:50,506
不允许有任何违反秩序的行为
No disorder will be tolerated.

101
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:35,070
好极了，泰门
That was lovely, Timon.

102
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,310
今天两匹种马被送到罗马来了
Two stallions have come to Rome today.

103
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,740
当然
Of course,

104
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,871
我太天真了
how childish of me.

105
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:47,041
 你想要马  是的
 You want the horse.  I do.

106
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:48,841
但你也别不高兴
But don't be sullen now.

107
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:50,611
我又没说和你做爱是件坏事
This was not a hardship for me.

108
00:12:50,671 --> 00:12:53,311
我总是发觉象你这样的
I've always found something perversely erotic

109
00:12:53,371 --> 00:12:55,572
好色小男人身上有些东西很诱人
about goaty little men.

110
00:13:04,812 --> 00:13:07,813
别躲在那里，屋大维，进来
Do please don't lurk, Octavian. Come in.

111
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:14,273
别像个呆子一样，过来
Don't be a goose. Come in.

112
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:29,015
我买了一匹马
I've bought a horse.

113
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,915
是吗？
Have you?

114
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:34,575
据说是罗马最好的马
The best horse in Rome by all accounts.

115
00:13:34,645 --> 00:13:36,415
我替你高兴
I'm very happy for you.

116
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:38,216
这是给你舅公的礼物
It's a gift for your great-uncle.

117
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,646
我想要你把它送到高卢去
I want you to take the animal to Gaul

118
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:42,946
亲自交给你舅公
and give it to him in person.

119
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:46,616
 为什么？  因为等他回到罗马
 Why?  Well, when he's back in Rome,

120
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:49,877
每个人都会争着给他送礼，所以我们必须作第一个
everyone will be giving him gifts. We must be first.

121
00:13:50,147 --> 00:13:52,277
我想他短时间内不会回罗马的
I doubt he will return to Rome anytime soon.

122
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:54,017
元老院对他颇有敌意
The Senate's hostility will prevent him.

123
00:13:54,077 --> 00:13:57,277
 从法律上说，这不是…  哦，别跟我说什么法律
 Legally speaking, it is not-  Please don't start speaking legally.

124
00:13:57,347 --> 00:13:59,948
 你知道我有多烦它  去高卢，路很远啊
 You know how it bores me.  It's a long way to Gaul.

125
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:02,448
正是，你不过是个小男孩
Exactly. While yet a mere boy,

126
00:14:02,518 --> 00:14:05,378
可你敢于冒着生命危险去给你敬爱的舅公献礼
you would risk your life to honor your beloved great-uncle.

127
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:09,278
你能独自一人骑着那高贵的白马去到恺撒的营地
You ride into Caesar's camp alone, on a noble white stallion.

128
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,419
这样的礼物，他可不会轻易忘记
That's a gift he won't soon forget.

129
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:13,749
 独自一人？  是啊，会有很多奴隶跟着你
 Alone?  Well, you'll have plenty of slaves.

130
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,549
你会很安全的
You'll be perfectly safe.

131
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:19,579
而且你也会让你的妈妈十分骄傲和开心
And you'll make your mamma very proud and happy.

132
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,250
卡托，元老院听你发言
Cato, the Senate hears you.

133
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,881
庞贝·麦格纳斯…
Pompey Magnus...

134
00:14:33,951 --> 00:14:37,351
我有个问题关于你的朋友，你的共同执政官…
I have a question concerning your friend and co-consul--

135
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:41,251
维纳斯的爱人盖乌斯·优利乌斯·恺撒
the darling of venus, Gaius Julius Caesar.

136
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:43,522
他的座位为什么仍然是空着的？
Why does his chair remain empty?

137
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,852
他为什么还不返回罗马来？他的非法战争已经结束了
Why does he not come home? His illegal war is over.

138
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:50,652
高卢人早就下跪投降了
Gaul is long since on it's knees.

139
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:54,523
恺撒为什么还不让他英勇的将士们
Why does Caesar keep his brave soldiers

140
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,983
与他们的家人和朋友团聚
from their families and friends?

141
00:15:01,353 --> 00:15:03,153
在长达八年的时间里
For eight long years,

142
00:15:03,223 --> 00:15:05,324
他就像一匹狼一样
he has gorged himself like a wolf

143
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:07,284
饱食着高卢人的血肉
on the blood of Gaul,

144
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:10,454
也由此变得富可敌国
and thereby made himself monstrously rich.

145
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:12,554
 为什么？  坐下！
 Why?  Sit down!

146
00:15:12,624 --> 00:15:16,885
为什么他出钱给那些暴民搞比赛和角斗，还给他们开筵席？
Why does he ply the mob with races and fights and gaudy feasts?

147
00:15:16,955 --> 00:15:19,285
为什么他帮这个元老院里的
Why has he paid the debts

148
00:15:19,355 --> 00:15:23,985
每个无耻之徒偿还他们的债务？
of every reprobate fool in this Senate house?

149
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:25,826
为什么？
Why?!

150
00:15:28,786 --> 00:15:31,456
让我来告诉你们为什么他做这些事情
I'll tell you why he does these things.

151
00:15:31,526 --> 00:15:33,456
是想给他自己买皇冠
He wants to buy himself a crown.

152
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:36,487
他想破坏共和
He wants to destroy the Republic

153
00:15:36,557 --> 00:15:39,787
然后统治罗马，作个血腥独裁者！
and rule Rome as a bloody tyrant!

154
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,987
这就是原因！
That's why!

155
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:49,328
因此，我提议…
Therefore, I move...

156
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:53,528
立即终止恺撒在高卢的行政权
that Caesar's governorship in Gaul be terminated immediately,

157
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:55,688
解散他的军队
that his armies be disbanded

158
00:15:55,758 --> 00:15:57,658
召他回罗马来等候制裁
and that he be recalled to Rome to answer charges

159
00:15:57,729 --> 00:15:59,689
要指控他发动非法战争
of illegal warfare,

160
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,989
偷窃，行贿，和叛国罪！
theft, bribery and treason!

161
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,760
很精彩，卡托
very good, Cato.

162
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,461
你还是一如既往充满活力和热情啊
Full of vim and verve, as usual.

163
00:16:19,531 --> 00:16:21,991
恺撒…
Caesar...

164
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:24,261
对广大民众一直非常慷慨
has been generous to the people

165
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:27,831
因为他像我一样热爱这些人民
because he loves the people as I do.

166
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:33,962
这个国家是由人民自己当家作主的，而不是你们这些高级的贵族
It is the people that rule, not you fine nobleman.

167
00:16:34,032 --> 00:16:36,332
是庞贝的军队在作主
It is Pompey's soldiers that rule,

168
00:16:36,392 --> 00:16:38,292
不是我们这些高级的贵族
not we fine nobleman.

169
00:16:38,362 --> 00:16:42,463
我来为大家节省点时间，不用再无谓地争吵
I'm going to save us all hours of useless clamor

170
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:45,663
我用我的执政官否决权，否决你的提议
and use my consular veto on your motion.

171
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:48,263
 好  我不…
 Yes!  I do not--

172
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,433
 我不…  静一静！
 I do not-  Silence!

173
00:16:53,694 --> 00:16:56,834
我们不是小孩，让执政官把话说完
Are we children? Let the consul speak.

174
00:16:56,894 --> 00:16:58,434
谢谢你，西赛罗
Thank you, Cicero.

175
00:16:58,494 --> 00:17:00,364
 我不…  可是…
 I do not-  However...

176
00:17:00,434 --> 00:17:03,095
在你继续之前请允许我先说两句
if I might say a few words before you continue.

177
00:17:06,295 --> 00:17:09,035
当你面对一只饿狼的时候
When confronted by a hungry wolf,

178
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,495
去刺激这头野兽是很不明智的
it is unwise to goad the beast,

179
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:13,696
如果照卡托说的做，就是去刺激它
as Cato would have us do.

180
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:17,336
但是同样不明智的
But it is equally unwise

181
00:17:17,396 --> 00:17:19,596
是把这只咆哮的野兽看成
to imagine the snarling animal

182
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,236
是朋友而伸出援手
a friend and offer your hand

183
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:23,796
就好像庞贝这样
as Pompey does.

184
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:26,267
那你是不是要建议我们爬到树上去啊
Perhaps you would have us climb a tree.

185
00:17:31,697 --> 00:17:34,797
恺撒是我发圣誓结义的兄弟
Caesar is my brother by sacred oath.

186
00:17:34,868 --> 00:17:38,368
我清楚他的心意，他是我的朋友
I know his heart. He is my friend

187
00:17:38,438 --> 00:17:41,038
也是共和国忠实的儿子
and a faithful son of the Republic.

188
00:17:41,098 --> 00:17:43,668
除非有人有证据说他不是
And until anyone proves that he is not,

189
00:17:43,738 --> 00:17:45,338
否则我永远不会背叛他
I will never betray him.

190
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:14,141
庞贝·麦格纳斯，我亲爱的朋友，见到你真高兴
Pompey Magnus, my dear fellow, you're well met.

191
00:18:14,201 --> 00:18:16,141
西比乌，卡托
Scipio, Cato.

192
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:18,842
我想你们不是笑剧的爱好者吧
I would not take you for lovers of the mime.

193
00:18:18,902 --> 00:18:22,002
介绍我女儿给你认识，科妮莉娅
You know my daughter, Cornelia.

194
00:18:22,072 --> 00:18:25,472
贵族普布利乌斯的遗孀，他战死在卡雷了
Widow of noble Publius who died at Carrhae.

195
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:29,303
科妮莉娅，你丈夫是个杰出的罗马战士
Cornelia, your husband was a fine Roman.

196
00:18:29,873 --> 00:18:30,873
谢谢你
I thank you.

197
00:18:32,843 --> 00:18:35,003
父亲，我不应该在这样的场合出现
Father, my presence is not appropriate.

198
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:37,703
舞台上有个淫荡的女人
There's a lewd woman on the stage.

199
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:40,374
我没注意
I had no notion.

200
00:18:40,444 --> 00:18:41,974
那我们就不久留了
We will not linger then.

201
00:18:42,044 --> 00:18:45,144
庞贝，祝你有个愉快的夜晚
Pompey, a pleasant good night.

202
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:52,345
如果你不介意，我们可以单独谈谈吗？
If it please you, might we speak alone?

203
00:18:55,645 --> 00:18:57,875
仅仅是靠贵族们
Neither we aristocrats alone

204
00:18:57,945 --> 00:19:00,345
或光靠你和你的将士们都不可能打败恺撒
nor you and your soldiers alone can crush Caesar.

205
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,006
别说了
Stop there.

206
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:04,206
我没说你想搞垮恺撒
I do not say that you wish to crush Caesar,

207
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,006
我就是说，如果你真想的话，你自己一个人干不来
I only say that if you did wish it, you could not do it alone.

208
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:10,546
我不需要你的贵族
I have no need of you noble gentleman.

209
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:12,577
只要我一跺脚
I have only to stamp my feet

210
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:15,207
我的军团就会崛起，遍布于整个意大利
and legions will spring up all over ltaly!

211
00:19:15,277 --> 00:19:18,207
把恺撒像只虫子一样地辗死
I can squash Caesar like an insect

212
00:19:18,277 --> 00:19:20,247
只要我想这样做
if I wished it so.

213
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:22,147
可是我不想这样
I do not wish it.

214
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:25,078
和他断绝关系，庞贝！
Renounce him, Pompey!

215
00:19:25,148 --> 00:19:27,008
罢免恺撒！
Renounce Caesar!

216
00:19:27,078 --> 00:19:30,448
和我们结盟，他的兵力自然就会减弱了
Ally yourself with us and his strength will wither away.

217
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:32,778
你才是真正的掌权者
It is you who is the real power.

218
00:19:32,848 --> 00:19:35,609
你才是人民真正爱戴的人
It is you the people truly love.

219
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,149
你以为当恺撒没有了
Think you they will still shout Caesar's name

220
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:40,709
高卢的小玩意扔给街上的人的时候，他们还会高呼他的名字吗？
when he runs out of Gallic trinkets to throw to them?

221
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:44,049
你以为我会在意街上的人叫谁的名字吗？
Think you I care what names are shouted in the streets?

222
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:47,350
没有比这个更重要的了
Nothing is more important.

223
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:53,210
你要我公然背叛朋友
You ask me to openly betray a friend.

224
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,150
这个我做不到
I cannot do it.

225
00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:56,811
晚安
Good night.

226
00:20:25,453 --> 00:20:30,454
噢，我的小傻弟弟
Oh, silly baby brother.

227
00:20:31,484 --> 00:20:33,684
不会有事的
Everything will be all right.

228
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:42,855
他很完美对不对？体面的小战士
Is he not perfect? Proper little soldier.

229
00:20:42,915 --> 00:20:44,855
 他很害怕  胡说
 He's scared.  Nonsense.

230
00:20:44,915 --> 00:20:46,585
罗马男人从来不害怕
Roman men are never scared.

231
00:20:46,655 --> 00:20:48,115
他就是有点舍不得离开妈妈
He's just sad to be leaving his mamma.

232
00:20:48,185 --> 00:20:50,386
你不是害怕了吧，屋大维？
You're not scared, are you, Octavian?

233
00:20:50,456 --> 00:20:52,556
你当然不会，很快就到了
Of course you're not. Time flies.

234
00:20:52,616 --> 00:20:55,116
亲爱的，给我一个吻
Give me a kiss, my love.

235
00:20:57,986 --> 00:21:00,457
安德鲁斯…
Andros...

236
00:21:00,517 --> 00:21:02,617
给我把他安全地带回来，不让我就把你小孩的眼珠
bring him back safe or I'll use the eyes

237
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:04,957
挖出来当珠子串
of your children for beads.

238
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:34,160
莱科，那匹马…不是很贵吧，我希望
Lyco, the horse- not too expensive I hope.

239
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,290
对不起，先生，那匹马已经卖掉了
I'm sorry, sir, the horse was sold already.

240
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,790
 卖给优利亚家的阿提娅了  阿提娅？
 To Atia of the Julii.  Atia?

241
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,820
她把马送到高卢去了…
She's sending it to Gaul--

242
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,821
作为给恺撒的礼物
a gift for Caesar.

243
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,791
他真该死！
Damn him!

244
00:21:51,861 --> 00:21:53,962
他非要什么都抢去吗？
Must he have everything?

245
00:21:57,122 --> 00:22:00,022
反正也要派你到高卢去
As you were going to be in Gaul anyway,

246
00:22:00,092 --> 00:22:03,922
我不如一石二鸟
I might kill two birds with one stone.

247
00:23:40,101 --> 00:23:41,731
让我看看你
Let me look at you.

248
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:43,572
还是那么丑，我怕你要这么说吧
As ugly as ever, I'm afraid.

249
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:45,772
一点也不，你成熟多了，布鲁图斯
Not at all. Age suits you, Brutus.

250
00:23:45,832 --> 00:23:47,532
我们有多久没见了
How long has it been?

251
00:23:47,602 --> 00:23:50,332
 五年？  不，六年
 Five years?  No, six.

252
00:23:50,402 --> 00:23:52,532
哈，真有创意啊
Oh, how clever.

253
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:54,733
这简直就是个像样的房子嘛
It's almost like a proper house.

254
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,860
Oh...

255
00:23:58,033 --> 00:24:00,573
我为你的所失深表遗憾
I deeply regret your loss.

256
00:24:02,103 --> 00:24:04,674
朱莉娅的事情，太可惜了
Julia and so forth. Horrible business.

257
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,604
向你哀悼，真的
Condolences, really.

258
00:24:10,204 --> 00:24:12,174
跟我说说，你妈妈怎么样了？
Now tell me, how's your mother?

259
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:14,134
和从前一样
The same as ever.

260
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:16,175
她要我向你问好，还要我问你
She sends her love, demands to know

261
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:18,205
为什么你几个月都没给她写信了
why you haven't written to her in months.

262
00:24:18,275 --> 00:24:20,805
只要你作我的信使，我补救还来得及吧
I can remedy that if you'll be my courier.

263
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:23,675
我有好几封信要你帮我送
I have several letters to send.

264
00:24:23,735 --> 00:24:26,336
只要我有力气坐到马背上去
If I can ever bring myself to get on another horse.

265
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:28,676
来这之前，我不知道高卢居然有这么远
I had no conception that Gaul was so far away.

266
00:24:28,736 --> 00:24:30,736
布鲁图斯，我的老伙计…
Brutus, me old cock...

267
00:24:30,806 --> 00:24:32,706
你到这儿干什么来了？
what on earth are you doing here?

268
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:34,476
马克·安东尼，你好啊
Mark Antony, how nice.

269
00:24:34,536 --> 00:24:36,677
我到纳贝看我的堂兄来了
I've been visiting my cousin in Narbo.

270
00:24:36,937 --> 00:24:39,037
哦？你那个傻子堂兄怎么样了？
Oh? How is that idiot cousin of yours?

271
00:24:39,107 --> 00:24:41,977
 他…  事实上，对不起，我有点急事
 He was-  Actually, I'm in a bit of a rush.

272
00:24:42,037 --> 00:24:44,637
我需要，大概半塔兰特的黄金
I need, say, a half talent of gold.

273
00:24:45,107 --> 00:24:48,338
 是吗？  让你看看他有多信任我
 Do you?  See how he trusts me.

274
00:24:48,408 --> 00:24:51,408
 是为鹰旗要的  当然，斯特雷波
 For the eagle.  Of course. Strabo!

275
00:24:52,678 --> 00:24:55,638
给马克·安东尼大人半塔兰特的黄金
Give his honor Mark Antony a half talent of gold.

276
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:58,879
 半塔兰特的黄金？  一分也不要多给
 A half talent of gold.  And not a penny more.

277
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:00,879
上帝啊
 Dominus.

278
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:07,239
我不知道你怎么能容忍那个人
I don't know how you tolerate that man.

279
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:09,310
他就是喜欢斗嘴
He likes to fight.

280
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:12,310
他的举止行为，让人觉得他一点家教都没有
The way he carries on, one might think he came from no family at all.

281
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,140
他是有点粗俗的一面，不过我不介意
He does have a vulgarian streak. I don't mind it.

282
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,380
那个鹰旗是怎么回事？
What is this about the eagle?

283
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:26,241
是我的军队标志被强盗偷去了
My personal standard was stolen by brigands.

284
00:25:26,311 --> 00:25:27,911
很麻烦
Abad business.

285
00:25:27,911 --> 00:25:30,982
军团士兵已经很想家，士气很低沉了
The legions were already homesick and surly when the eagle was taken,

286
00:25:31,012 --> 00:25:32,942
加上鹰旗再被偷走，他们肯定要造反了
now they're positively mutinous.

287
00:25:33,012 --> 00:25:35,142
他们认为这是我厄运的征兆
The men think it's a sure sign of my doom,

288
00:25:35,212 --> 00:25:38,212
就像一群鹅一样叫嚷着要解散军队
and they're clamoring like geese for disbandment.

289
00:25:38,282 --> 00:25:41,013
他们看起来倒不像不高兴的样子
They did not seem so unhappy.

290
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:44,413
他们从来不会表现出不满，不然是会挨鞭子的
Well, they never flaunt their discontent. Gets them whipped.

291
00:25:44,483 --> 00:25:46,713
我告诉你，布鲁图斯
I tell you, Brutus,

292
00:25:46,783 --> 00:25:48,613
我已经没有办法了
I'm at my wits end.

293
00:26:06,615 --> 00:26:08,145
屋大维少爷…
Master Octavian...

294
00:26:09,815 --> 00:26:11,415
离瓦西欧只有几里路了
vasio is only a few more miles.

295
00:26:11,485 --> 00:26:13,716
没有我的允许，不许碰我
Do not touch me without permission.

296
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:16,686
给我水
Water.

297
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:57,150
卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯
Lucius Vorenus.

298
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,950
你是个聪明人
You have a brain.

299
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,591
那些护民官是这么说的
So the tribunes say.

300
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:11,251
那么告诉我，如果要你去把恺撒的鹰旗找回来
So tell me, if it were you who had to retrieve Caesar's eagle,

301
00:27:11,321 --> 00:27:12,991
你打算怎么做？
how would you go about it?

302
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:17,752
我会把从高卢各个部落抓来的俘虏
Uh, I'd take captives from every tribe in Gaul

303
00:27:17,822 --> 00:27:19,422
一个一个地钉在十字架上
and crucify them one by one

304
00:27:19,492 --> 00:27:21,752
直到有人说出鹰旗的下落为止
until someone tells me where the eagle is.

305
00:27:21,822 --> 00:27:24,722
然后，我就会火速地悄悄派一到两个人
Then, I would go in quick and quiet with one or two men

306
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:26,892
然后…去把它偷回来
and... steal it back.

307
00:27:26,952 --> 00:27:29,723
好，我们想到一起去了
Good. We are of one mind.

308
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:31,953
 照做  照做，长官？
 Do it.  Do it, sir?

309
00:27:32,023 --> 00:27:34,123
我记得第三军团有个分队专门负责拷问俘虏
Well, I believe there's a torture detachment with the third,

310
00:27:34,193 --> 00:27:37,153
但你也可以选自己的人去做，只要你愿意
but you may choose your own men if you wish.

311
00:27:44,394 --> 00:27:47,624
这里是四分之一塔兰特的黄金，给你作行贿之类的事情用
There's a quarter talent there, for bribes and such.

312
00:27:47,694 --> 00:27:50,895
 好好利用  是，长官
 Spend it wisely.  Sir.

313
00:28:04,526 --> 00:28:06,856
不！请把我放下来！
No! Please let me down!

314
00:28:06,926 --> 00:28:09,726
让我下来！
Let me down!

315
00:28:13,227 --> 00:28:16,297
放我下来，我知道…我知道鹰旗的下落
Let me down! I know- I know where the eagle is.

316
00:28:16,357 --> 00:28:18,727
 说  是那些蓝色的西班牙人偷去的
 Speak.  The Blue Spaniards,

317
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,527
他们来呆了一晚上…
they came to stay for one night...

318
00:28:21,597 --> 00:28:24,258
然后就骑马朝卡达西去了
and then rode to the Cadurci lands.

319
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:27,258
求求你！求求你！放我下来！
Please! Please please. Let me down.

320
00:28:27,528 --> 00:28:30,228
卡达西
Cadurci.

321
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:32,998
我真是倒霉透了
Fortune pisses on me.

322
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:35,659
 请让我下来！  放他们下来
 Please let me down!  Take them down.

323
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:41,199
门神，佛克琉斯
Forculus,

324
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:43,929
如果你在天有灵的话
if you be the right god for the business here,

325
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:45,600
我乞求你帮助我
I call on you to help me.

326
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,660
如果你能打开这扇门
If you will open this door,

327
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,630
我就杀一头白色的羊羔祭奉你
then I will kill for you a fine white lamb,

328
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,030
或者，要是我买不到便宜的羊
or, failing that, if I couldn't get a good one at a decent price,

329
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,331
我就杀六只乳鸽给你
then six pigeons.

330
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,401
门神佛克琉斯，我向你发誓
This, Forculus, I vow to you.

331
00:28:57,461 --> 00:28:59,731
兵团士兵泰特斯·波罗，起立
Legionary Titus Pullo, stand up.

332
00:29:07,502 --> 00:29:08,502
他来这干什么？
 What's he doing here?  You are to be released

333
00:29:08,502 --> 00:29:10,202
你被释放了
to the command of Second Spear Centurion Lucius vorenus.

334
00:29:10,562 --> 00:29:12,802
这是第二箭枪队百夫长卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯的旨意

335
00:29:12,862 --> 00:29:16,032
按照他说的去做，只要你让他满意，就可以饶你不用去角斗场上被人打死
Do your duty to his satisfaction, and you'll be spared damnation in the arena.

336
00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:19,363
我连站在这个臭狗屎矮子旁边都不乐意，更别说帮他做事了
I won't even stand next to this short-assed shit,

337
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:20,933
我还是呆在这吧，谢谢你了
Ieave alone serve under him. I'll stay here, thanks very much.

338
00:29:21,003 --> 00:29:23,663
这命令是直接来自于马克·安东尼阁下的
These orders come direct from his Excellency Mark Antony himself.

339
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:25,963
要你去找回恺撒的鹰旗
You are to retrieve Caesar's eagle.

340
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,434
要我，去找回恺撒的鹰旗？
Me, retrieve Caesar's eagle?

341
00:29:40,305 --> 00:29:41,965
 布鲁图斯  妈妈！
 Brutus?  Mamma!

342
00:29:45,805 --> 00:29:49,206
你不知道回到家的感觉有多好
You can't imagine how good it is to be home.

343
00:29:49,266 --> 00:29:50,836
你晒得跟豆子一样黑了
You're as brown as a bean.

344
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:53,536
不过这让我看起来英气风发
It makes me look quite soldierly though.

345
00:29:53,606 --> 00:29:56,136
是啊，是啊
It does, it does.

346
00:29:56,206 --> 00:29:59,336
 你堂兄马赛琉斯好不好？  他很枯燥乏味，不过身体还不错
 How is cousin Marcellus?  Tedious but healthy.

347
00:29:59,406 --> 00:30:01,037
 恺撒呢？  谁？
 And Caesar?  Who?

348
00:30:01,107 --> 00:30:02,907
别跟我兜圈子
Don't be cruel.

349
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,967
他还好吗？他问起我了吗？
Is he well? Did he ask of me?

350
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:07,867
他有吗？我记不起来了
Did he? I can't recall.

351
00:30:07,937 --> 00:30:09,537
我想是没有
I think not.

352
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:11,668
不过他倒的确写了封信给你
He did write you a letter though.

353
00:30:11,738 --> 00:30:13,938
哦，你这个坏家伙
Oh, you beast.

354
00:30:14,008 --> 00:30:17,338
“最亲爱的赛维莉娅，原谅我长时间没有给你写信
"Dearest Servilia, forgive my long silence.

355
00:30:17,408 --> 00:30:20,838
最近的这几个月里全是血雨腥风，金戈铁马
These last long months were all blood and iron and mud,

356
00:30:20,908 --> 00:30:23,109
没有时间给朋友写信
and no time for letters to friends.

357
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:26,469
但我的确一直在想念着你，带着深深的情意
Be sure that I have been thinking of you with great affection.

358
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:29,809
我渴望和你在一起和你独处”
I long to be together and alone with you."

359
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,370
“深深的情意”
"Great affection."

360
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,440
渴望和你独处
Longs to be alone with you.

361
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:41,710
你认为他跟他的妻子也这么说吗？
You think he says such things to his wife?

362
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,341
“情意”？是什么？
"Affection"? What's that?

363
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:46,911
他不可能说“爱”
He could not say "love."

364
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:50,011
你难道还想让他为你弹竖琴吗？
Would you have him pluck a harp?

365
00:30:50,071 --> 00:30:51,611
他是个军人，不是诗人
He's a soldier, not a poet.

366
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:53,471
天色渐晚了
The day dwindles.

367
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:55,612
我们的客人要到了
Our guests will be arriving.

368
00:31:10,113 --> 00:31:13,443
你马骑地不错啊，几乎和我差不多好了
You ride well, almost as well as me.

369
00:31:13,513 --> 00:31:15,344
波罗，注意你对我的称呼
Pullo, you will address me correctly.

370
00:31:15,414 --> 00:31:17,614
几乎和我差不多好了，长官
Almost as well as me, sir.

371
00:31:17,674 --> 00:31:20,474
我是天生的，我猜我父亲大概是个努比亚人
Me, I'm a natural. My father was a Ubian probably.

372
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:22,614
你从哪儿学的骑术，这么好？
Where did you learn to ride so nice?

373
00:31:24,614 --> 00:31:27,775
你爱说不说吧，我只不过是想气氛融洽点
Please yourself. Only trying to be pleasant.

374
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:30,645
我母亲家那边的人在穆提那养马
My mother's people raised horses in Mutina.

375
00:31:30,715 --> 00:31:32,875
穆提那，靠近瑞吉姆？在它北边附近？
Mutina, near Reggium? Up round there?

376
00:31:32,945 --> 00:31:35,845
 在北边  好地方
 Up there.  Good country.

377
00:31:37,346 --> 00:31:40,146
听着，长官，谢谢你带我来干这个差事
Listen, sir, thank you, for taking me on this job.

378
00:31:40,216 --> 00:31:43,216
 这是个很大度道歉的办法  道什么歉？
 A noble way to make amends.  Amends?

379
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,216
我被关进监狱是拜你所赐啊
For getting me into this cac by calling me names.

380
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:48,017
 不客气  不，我不会忘记的
 Think nothing of it.  Never. I won't forget.

381
00:31:48,077 --> 00:31:50,617
泰图斯·波罗从不忘恩
Titus Pullo never forgets a favor.

382
00:31:50,877 --> 00:31:52,547
 哈！  你“哈”是什么意思？
 Hah!  What you mean, "Hah"?

383
00:31:52,617 --> 00:31:55,677
你觉得我们找到鹰旗的机会有多大？
What do you think our chances are of finding the eagle?

384
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,517
13军从不辱命，不是吗？
13th never fails, eh?

385
00:31:57,577 --> 00:32:00,318
几乎没有机会，鹰旗可能在任何地方
Little or no chance. The eagle might be anywhere.

386
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:03,278
被焚烧了，熔化了或者是被沉到海底了
Buried, melted down, sunk to bottom of the sea.

387
00:32:03,348 --> 00:32:05,478
我们等于是在黑夜里追踪一只黑狗
We are hunting a black dog in the night.

388
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,878
然而找不到鹰旗和把鹰旗搞丢了差不多是同罪的
And not finding the eagle is much the same as losing it.

389
00:32:07,948 --> 00:32:09,849
我们会颜面尽失的，所以，我选择你
We will be disgraced. Now, I chose you

390
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,719
你因为你已经够丢脸了，而且你有死罪在身
because you are disgraced already and condemned to die.

391
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:14,279
那么是说你根本就不是在赔礼道歉喽？
So you weren't making amends at all, then?

392
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,919
波罗，事实上你已经是死路一条了
Pullo, in effect, you're dead already.

393
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:21,620
死一个酒鬼蠢货对军团来说根本不算是损失
The loss of one drunken fool does little damage to the legion.

394
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,420
如果我已经死路一条了，长官
If I'm dead already then, sir,

395
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,480
你得要注意跟我说话的语气
you should take care how you speak to me.

396
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,280
如果我已经一无所有了
If I've got nothing to lose,

397
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,920
那又有什么能阻止我把你剁成肉酱
what's to stop me cutting you into little gobs

398
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,221
然后骑马而去的呢？
and riding off, eh?

399
00:32:32,281 --> 00:32:33,981
有什么能阻止我的，长官？
What's to stop me, sir?

400
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:37,021
要是作为一个第13军团的战士的荣誉感还不足以阻止你的话
Well, if your honor as a soldier of the 1 3th isn't enough,

401
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:39,621
那么我就要靠自己高超的博斗技巧了
then I'll have to rely on my superior fighting skills.

402
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:42,352
 高超的博斗技巧？  嗯
 Superior fighting skills?  Mmm.

403
00:32:42,722 --> 00:32:44,222
很好
very good.

404
00:32:46,122 --> 00:32:49,252
当然，你们还要想象一下，这么长的头发
And of course, you have to imagine long hair down to here,

405
00:32:49,322 --> 00:32:51,982
浓密的胡须，最让人恶心的臭味
huge moustaches, the most horrific stench.

406
00:32:52,052 --> 00:32:53,983
他们只吃生肉，而且从不洗澡
They eat only raw meat and never wash.

407
00:32:54,053 --> 00:32:56,623
哦，他们的确有个令人钦佩的风俗
Oh, they do have one admirable custom.

408
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,483
他们解决政治争端的方法
They settle their political disputes

409
00:32:58,553 --> 00:33:01,323
是靠一场生死格斗
by single combat to the death.

410
00:33:01,383 --> 00:33:04,124
 绝妙的办法  不是吗？
 Excellent idea.  lsn't it?

411
00:33:04,184 --> 00:33:07,084
妈妈总是唠叨要我参与政治
Mother is always nagging me to attend politics.

412
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:09,684
这是我们家族的传统
Well, it's been our family's tradition

413
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,424
还有责任…
and duty for...

414
00:33:11,484 --> 00:33:12,924
五百年了
500 years.

415
00:33:12,984 --> 00:33:14,855
都是些枯燥的可怕的东西
It is such dreadfully dull stuff.

416
00:33:14,925 --> 00:33:17,725
你看，如果我们的元老院也按日耳曼风格来办事
Now you see, if our Senate conducted business in the German style,

417
00:33:17,785 --> 00:33:19,385
那我就肯定会去看的
I should certainly go and watch.

418
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,525
是啊，没有冗长的诉讼和无止境的争辩
Yeah, no tedious lawsuits and endless debates,

419
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:23,785
只有剑和匕首…
just swords, daggers--

420
00:33:23,855 --> 00:33:26,086
 那就有趣多了  布鲁图斯，过来说句话
 much more entertaining.  Brutus, a word.

421
00:33:27,926 --> 00:33:32,656
告诉我，你是个好裁判
Tell me, you are a good judge.

422
00:33:32,726 --> 00:33:36,487
我亲爱的朋友恺撒如何？
How is my dear friend Caesar?

423
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,887
呃，他…
Well, he is--

424
00:33:38,957 --> 00:33:40,627
他还不错，我觉得
he's been better, I think.

425
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:45,187
很…很疲倦，老实说
very- very weary, to be honest.

426
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,588
 有点意志消沉  恺撒，意志消沉？
 A little demoralized.  Caesar demoralized?

427
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,628
 绝不会  他的军旗被偷了
 Never.  His standard was stolen.

428
00:33:49,688 --> 00:33:51,558
他怎么会让这样的蠢事发生？
How did he let a foolish thing like that happen?

429
00:33:51,688 --> 00:33:54,758
我不知道，但他对这件事的态度还有这件事引起来的骚动…
I don't know, but his manner and uproar about it--

430
00:33:54,828 --> 00:33:57,689
你知道那些庶民们对这样的事会有什么样的反应…
you know how plebeians can be about such things--

431
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:00,089
不顾一切地想回家，都很想造反了
desperate to come home, mutinous.

432
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,459
我听说了那里有些不满情绪
I have heard there was some discontent,

433
00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:05,829
但造反？难以置信
but mutinous? Hard to believe.

434
00:34:05,889 --> 00:34:07,789
你可以想象嘛
Can you imagine?

435
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:10,290
毕竟，他这样对他的将士
After all he has done for them,

436
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,390
他也不敢肯定他们会不会…
he is not sure whether they will--

437
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,330
再继续替他卖命打仗了
will fight for him anymore.

438
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:18,390
而且这些下等阶层的人也没有什么所谓忠心耿耿的意识
And the lower classes have a very very crude sense of loyalty.

439
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,661
 我无冒犯之意  啊？
 No offense.  Eh?

440
00:34:21,731 --> 00:34:23,961
我不是说你，你也是来自下层社会的人
I don't mean you. You are lower class,

441
00:34:24,031 --> 00:34:26,861
不过，我是说下等阶层的人，一般而言
but that is to say, the lower class in general, however.

442
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:30,262
都没有什么忠心的意识
A very crude sense of loyalty.

443
00:34:30,332 --> 00:34:31,932
失陪一下
Excuse me.

444
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:35,292
“我亲爱的侄女
"My dear niece,

445
00:34:35,362 --> 00:34:37,262
我希望你和孩子们都过地好
I hope you and the children are well.

446
00:34:37,332 --> 00:34:38,862
我有个任务给你
I have a task for you.

447
00:34:38,932 --> 00:34:41,763
政策上我应该给庞贝找位新夫人
Policy dictates I give a new wife to Pompey,

448
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:44,593
但我走了太久，所以不知道
but I have been gone too long to know who among the females

449
00:34:44,663 --> 00:34:46,263
我们家族里的女性，哪个合适
of our family would be suitable.

450
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,793
我可以去问卡尔普蕊娜，尽管她是个出色的妻子
I would ask Calpurnia, but though an excellent wife,

451
00:34:48,863 --> 00:34:51,694
可是办这样的事，她却没什么眼力
she has no eye for this kind of business.

452
00:34:51,764 --> 00:34:54,064
帮我个忙，挑选任何一个
Do me the favor of selecting whichever girl

453
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,864
只要是你认为最能取悦庞贝的人
you think most likely to please

454
00:34:55,934 --> 00:34:58,564
然后以我的名义把她送给他”
and offer her to him in my name."

455
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:04,035
哦，对不起，我想事情想得出神了
Excuse me, I was far away.

456
00:35:04,095 --> 00:35:06,065
我希望，恺撒没带给你什么坏消息吧
Caesar has no bad news for you, I hope.

457
00:35:06,135 --> 00:35:08,235
不，一点也没有，一点也没有
No, not at all. Not at all.

458
00:35:08,295 --> 00:35:10,395
 多美好的宴会啊  谢谢你
 What a lovely party.  Thank you.

459
00:35:10,465 --> 00:35:13,236
还是不及你穿着这条裙子那么美好
Not as lovely as you look in that dress.

460
00:35:13,296 --> 00:35:15,496
嘘
Shh.

461
00:35:15,566 --> 00:35:19,666
还有奥克塔维娅…真漂亮
And Octavia- beautiful.

462
00:35:19,736 --> 00:35:21,896
这是我的努力的结果
Well, I try.

463
00:35:21,966 --> 00:35:25,137
她自己总是很懒散，不修边幅的
She will insist on slouching.

464
00:35:25,197 --> 00:35:27,197
屋大维呢？
Where's Octavian?

465
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:30,067
他去高卢了
 He's in Gaul.  Oh.

466
00:36:47,644 --> 00:36:51,305
圣母说你的儿子不会有危险的
Great Mother says no harm shall come to your boy.

467
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,405
那就好
Good.

468
00:36:56,845 --> 00:36:59,745
跟我说说，你的婚姻如何？
Tell me now, how goes your marriage?

469
00:36:59,805 --> 00:37:01,446
格雷毕斯是个好男人
Glabius is a good man.

470
00:37:01,506 --> 00:37:04,946
你这么说我很惊讶，我一直以为你们俩之间有问题呢
You surprise me. I always thought there were difficulties between you.

471
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:07,206
你一定总要这样一针见血吗？
Must you always have a needle in hand?

472
00:37:07,276 --> 00:37:09,676
我只不过是问问，原谅我的好奇
I was only asking. Excuse my curiosity.

473
00:37:09,746 --> 00:37:11,547
过去是有些困难
There was some difficulties in the past,

474
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:13,477
但是我们已经克服了
but we overcame them.

475
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:15,677
我们很相爱
We love each other very much.

476
00:37:15,747 --> 00:37:17,407
哦，真遗憾，现在我觉得不安了
Well, that's a shame. Now I feel bad.

477
00:37:17,477 --> 00:37:20,007
我原以为你会很高兴的
I thought you'd be overjoyed.

478
00:37:20,077 --> 00:37:22,107
你什么意思？
What do you mean?

479
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,348
舅公优利乌斯打算把你嫁给
Uncle Julius intends to marry you

480
00:37:26,408 --> 00:37:29,008
庞贝·麦格纳斯
to Pompey Magnus.

481
00:37:30,608 --> 00:37:33,349
 舅公优利乌斯打算…  我知道庞贝的品位是有点低
 Uncle Julius intends-  Pompey is a touch low in manner,

482
00:37:33,409 --> 00:37:35,309
但我听人说，他是个完美无缺的爱人
but I'm told he's a perfectly adequate lover.

483
00:37:36,009 --> 00:37:38,679
而且你就是罗马的第一夫人了
And you shall be the first woman in Rome.

484
00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:42,449
明摆着，我们得让你和格雷毕斯离婚
We shall have to get you divorced from Glabius, obviously.

485
00:37:42,509 --> 00:37:43,209
越快越好
Quick as poss.

486
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,150
我不会这么做的
I will not do it. I love my husband.

487
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,450
我爱我的丈夫
If you do not divorce Glabius willingly,

488
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,180
如果你不心甘情愿地和格雷毕斯离婚

489
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,350
那么恺撒就会要格雷毕斯和你离婚
then Caesar will ask Glabius to divorce you.

490
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:55,281
 格雷毕斯会拒绝的  当然，但他就会被杀死
 And Glabius will refuse.  Doubtless, and then he'll be killed.

491
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:57,211
有人会愿意这样的事发生吗？
And does anybody want that to happen?

492
00:37:58,511 --> 00:38:00,611
恺撒不会这么做的
Caesar would not do that.

493
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:03,951
那个男人在高卢呆了八年了
The man's been in Gaul for eight years.

494
00:38:04,011 --> 00:38:05,912
他就是一头凶残的野兽
He's practically a wild beast.

495
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:21,983
那个男人眼中含着泪
The man has tears in his eyes.

496
00:38:22,053 --> 00:38:24,413
眼泪
Tears.

497
00:38:24,483 --> 00:38:26,653
他爱我
He loves me.

498
00:38:26,713 --> 00:38:29,284
一个娘娘腔的丈夫有什么用
A womanish husband is no use to anyone.

499
00:38:29,354 --> 00:38:31,354
还有你的那些仆人！有什么好大惊小怪的！
And your servants! What a fuss!

500
00:38:31,414 --> 00:38:33,684
我看你把他们喂的太好了
I think you feed them too much.

501
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:38,615
我看再多上点砒霜，盖娅
A little more arsenic, I think, Gaia.

502
00:38:38,685 --> 00:38:42,055
高兴点，奥克塔维娅
Try to look a little more cheerful, Octavia.

503
00:38:42,115 --> 00:38:44,485
 这是为了我们家庭的利益  我不在乎
 It's for the good of the family.  I don't care.

504
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:47,315
你和我，还有你弟弟在这个世界上相依为命
You and I and your brother are alone in the world.

505
00:38:47,355 --> 00:38:49,356
 我们要坚强  不是只有我们三个
 We have to be strong.  We are not alone.

506
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:51,756
 恺撒是…  恺撒在高卢
 Caesar is-  Caesar is in Gaul.

507
00:38:51,816 --> 00:38:53,816
庞贝在这里
Pompey is here.

508
00:38:55,486 --> 00:38:57,556
勇敢点，我亲爱的
Courage, my love.

509
00:39:04,987 --> 00:39:08,257
帕提亚人威胁着我的左侧
The Parthian were threatening my left flank.

510
00:39:08,317 --> 00:39:11,758
如此一来，我并没有按照惯例
And so, rather than shorten the line

511
00:39:11,818 --> 00:39:13,758
缩短战线
as would be conventional,

512
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:18,618
而是把我的后备骑兵送到翼侧反而包围了在我左侧的部队
I sent in my cavalry reserve and outflanked the flankers.

513
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:24,519
好极了，麦格纳斯，真精彩
Bravo, Magnus. Masterly.

514
00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:27,519
他是不是很棒，奥克塔维娅？
Is he not, Octavia, masterly?

515
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:30,759
很棒
Masterly.

516
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:32,960
麦格纳斯，告诉我，说实话
Magnus, tell me something, and be honest.

517
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,860
你喜欢我的女儿吗？
Does my daughter please you?

518
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,860
非常喜欢，毋须置疑
very pleasing, no doubt.

519
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,660
那么我告诉你，恺撒
Then I can tell you that Caesar,

520
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,820
作为他对你长久友谊的象征
as a token of his abiding friendship,

521
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,961
愿意把她送给你作妻子
would like to offer her to you in marriage.

522
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,276
Ah.Ahem.

523
00:39:50,861 --> 00:39:53,221
她不是嫁给年轻的格雷毕斯了吗？
She is not married to young Glabius?

524
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:55,462
离婚了
Divorced.

525
00:39:57,622 --> 00:40:00,292
 也许你需要时间考虑  不好意思
 Perhaps you need time to think.  Excuse me,

526
00:40:00,362 --> 00:40:03,292
我没有心理准备
I was taken unawares.

527
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:07,563
我怎能拒绝这样一个可敬又高贵的新娘呢？
How could I refuse such a worthy and dignified bride?

528
00:40:07,923 --> 00:40:11,063
 恺撒太慷慨了  太好了
 Caesar is far too generous.  Excellent.

529
00:40:11,123 --> 00:40:13,363
我们要等到下个月
We would have to wait until next month

530
00:40:13,423 --> 00:40:15,324
再办一个正式的仪式
for an actual ceremony, of course,

531
00:40:15,394 --> 00:40:17,694
是要等朱莉娅的丧期过了以后
when Julia's mourning days are over.

532
00:40:17,764 --> 00:40:19,894
当然，当然，不过你可以
Of course, of course. But you may take

533
00:40:19,964 --> 00:40:22,524
在任何时候履行丈夫的权利
your betrothal privileges any time you wish.

534
00:40:25,194 --> 00:40:26,625
要是你愿意，现在就可以
Now, if you like.

535
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:31,325
 这个就真的不需要了  别傻了
 Really, that's not necessary.  Don't be silly.

536
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:34,065
奥克塔维娅会乐意的
Octavia would love to.

537
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:36,395
不用不好意思
There's no need for shyness.

538
00:40:36,466 --> 00:40:39,526
毕竟，我们现在都是一家人了
We're all family now, after all.

539
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:09,269
英国女人…都是些野蛮的婊子
British women- now, that's savage cunny.

540
00:41:09,329 --> 00:41:11,329
你得像猎鹿一样对她们穷追不舍
You have to hunt them down like deer.

541
00:41:11,399 --> 00:41:13,169
记住，一旦你把她们搞到手了
Mind, once you get them under you,

542
00:41:13,229 --> 00:41:15,029
想怎么马虎她们都行
slack as your best Narbo scortum.

543
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:17,029
除了女人你就不能想点别的？
Do you care for nothing but women?

544
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,429
还有什么？哦，还有吃的？
What else is there? Food, I suppose.

545
00:41:19,499 --> 00:41:21,170
你不喜欢女人？
You don't like women?

546
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,230
我当然喜欢
Of course I do.

547
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,070
我结婚了
I'm married to one.

548
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:29,330
 我妻子叫内奥比  我明白了，百夫长可以结婚？
 I have a wife, Niobe.  I see. Centurions can marry then?

549
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,071
我有特许
I received a special dispensation.

550
00:41:31,131 --> 00:41:34,631
特许？那她肯定是个什么不赖的…
A special dispensation? She must be some good...

551
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:39,201
女人
woman.

552
00:41:41,071 --> 00:41:43,032
她是
She is.

553
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,832
你有很长时间没见她了吧
Been awhile since you've seen her then.

554
00:41:46,902 --> 00:41:49,772
7年零140天
Seven years, 140 days.

555
00:41:49,832 --> 00:41:53,473
挺不容易的，祝你好运
That's hard. May fortune smile on you.

556
00:41:53,533 --> 00:41:55,233
我，我的要求很简单
Me, I have simpler tastes.

557
00:41:55,303 --> 00:41:57,573
我就想杀死我的敌人拿走他们的黄金
I like to kill my enemy, take their gold

558
00:41:57,633 --> 00:41:59,273
享受他们的女人
and enjoy their women.

559
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:02,133
就这么简单，为什么要在吊在一棵树上呢？
That's it. Why tie yourself to one?

560
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:04,234
那还有什么滋味？有什么乐子？
Where's the flavor? Where's the joy?

561
00:42:04,304 --> 00:42:06,534
你最近一次和女人睡完觉后
When was the last time you had a woman

562
00:42:06,604 --> 00:42:08,704
他们没有哭着嚷着找你要钱，是在什么时候？
who wasn't crying or wanting payment?

563
00:42:11,934 --> 00:42:14,605
你站第一班岗，等月亮当顶的时候叫醒我
You're on first watch. Wake me when the moon's at the zenith.

564
00:42:14,675 --> 00:42:16,975
遵命，长官
Right you are, sir.

565
00:42:26,476 --> 00:42:27,106
站住！
Halt!

566
00:42:28,236 --> 00:42:30,036
站住！
Halt!

567
00:42:35,507 --> 00:42:37,307
见他妈的鬼！
Sons of Dis!

568
00:42:45,537 --> 00:42:47,308
反正那些也不是什么好马
They weren't such good horses anyway.

569
00:42:47,378 --> 00:42:49,278
我手下的士兵曾在扎马和麦格尼西亚作战
My people fought at Zama and Magnesia,

570
00:42:49,338 --> 00:42:51,708
我的父亲曾和苏拉同骑，而我却落到这样的境地…
my father rode with Sulla, and I'm reduced to this--

571
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:53,908
没有马骑，还被几个小鬼给抢了
unhorsed and robbed by children.

572
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,809
好漂亮的马
Nice horse.

573
00:43:28,241 --> 00:43:31,342
看过来，战神，看过来，战神
Look here, Mars. Look here, Mars.

574
00:43:31,412 --> 00:43:34,782
我是泰图斯·波罗，这些血淋淋的人是我给您的礼物
I am Titus Pullo. These bloody men, my gift to you.

575
00:43:36,442 --> 00:43:39,812
感谢上帝你的出现，我非常感激你
Thank the gods you came. I am extremely grateful to you.

576
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:42,178
Aye!

577
00:43:43,543 --> 00:43:47,083
听着，我命令你马上给我松绑
Listen to me. I order you to release me this instant.

578
00:43:47,143 --> 00:43:50,183
一个奴隶还敢这样说话啊，凭你这张嘴，你休想活得长
Fine way for a slave to talk. You won't get far with a mouth on you.

579
00:43:50,243 --> 00:43:54,444
我不是奴隶，我是优利亚家的盖乌斯·屋大维
I'm no slave. I'm Gaius Octavian of the Julii.

580
00:43:54,514 --> 00:43:56,784
 优利乌斯·恺撒的孙外甥  盖乌斯什么？
 Great-nephew of Julius Caesar.  Gaius who?

581
00:43:56,844 --> 00:43:59,014
我是罗马贵族公民
I am a Roman citizen of noble birth,

582
00:43:59,084 --> 00:44:01,244
我命令你割断这些绳子
and I order you to cut these ropes.

583
00:44:01,314 --> 00:44:02,915
说“请”
Say please.

584
00:44:03,915 --> 00:44:05,015
请你
Please.

585
00:44:36,748 --> 00:44:38,948
我保证你们会得到丰厚的酬谢
Be assured you will be amply rewarded

586
00:44:39,018 --> 00:44:41,048
作为你们为我效劳的奖赏
for your services to me.

587
00:44:41,118 --> 00:44:42,918
看到他多会说话啊
See how good he talks?

588
00:44:42,988 --> 00:44:44,949
他说的挺像真的，我相信他
He's convincing, I'll give him that.

589
00:44:45,019 --> 00:44:47,089
恺撒会证明我是谁的，带我去见他
Caesar will prove who I am. Take me to him.

590
00:44:47,149 --> 00:44:49,719
现在还不行
We cannot do that as yet.

591
00:44:49,789 --> 00:44:50,019
我们有命令在身  什么命令？
 We have orders.  What orders?

592
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:52,021
我们要找回恺撒被盗走的鹰旗
We are to retrieve Caesar's stolen eagle.

593
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:54,049
恺撒才不会在意他的鹰旗呢
Caesar wouldn't pull a hair for his eagle.

594
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:55,650
你们干的这是个徒劳的差事
You're on a fool's errand.

595
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,890
如果恺撒不在意鹰旗，那他为什么派我们去找？
If Caesar doesn't care about the eagle, why did he send us to find it?

596
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,590
如果不花一点气力去找，那他就看起来太奇怪了
It would look strange if he made no efforts.

597
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:03,520
实际上，鹰旗不见了对恺撒是有好处的
Actually, losing the eagle is useful to Caesar.

598
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:05,320
为什么这对恺撒有好处？
Why would that be useful to Caesar?

599
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:07,921
因为庞贝不是个深奥的哲人
Because Pompey is no deep philosopher.

600
00:45:07,991 --> 00:45:10,191
他会把这个象征性的损失当作是真实的弱像
He will take a symbolic loss for a real weakness.

601
00:45:10,251 --> 00:45:11,591
解释给我听
Explain.

602
00:45:13,191 --> 00:45:16,491
恺撒不想首先出击对付自己的老友
Caesar doesn't want to strike the first blow against an old friend,

603
00:45:16,551 --> 00:45:19,492
所以他想引诱庞贝先来攻击他
so he wishes to lure Pompey into attacking him first.

604
00:45:19,552 --> 00:45:22,222
而只有让庞贝相信恺撒变弱了他才会这么做
Pompey will only do this if he believes Caesar is weak.

605
00:45:22,292 --> 00:45:24,822
不，他们两个好得像亲兄弟一样
No. They're as good as brothers, those two.

606
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:28,053
朱莉娅死了之后，他们俩之间最后一条真实的纽带就断了
When Julia died, the last true bond between them was cut.

607
00:45:28,123 --> 00:45:31,153
恺撒把普通大众的爱戴都从庞贝那里赢了过去
Caesar has taken the love of the common people from Pompey,

608
00:45:31,223 --> 00:45:34,653
这就是他最有价值的财富，战争是不可避免的了
and that was his most prized possession. A battle is inevitable.

609
00:45:47,154 --> 00:45:48,854
波罗！
Pullo.

610
00:45:50,895 --> 00:45:52,795
蓝色的西班牙人！
Blue Spaniards!

611
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:52,430
早上好，舅公
Good morning, Uncle!

612
00:46:54,501 --> 00:46:56,701
屋大维？
Octavian?

613
00:47:03,231 --> 00:47:06,362
这是庞贝的人，我错看了他
One of Pompey's men. I misjudged him.

614
00:47:06,402 --> 00:47:08,832
我原以为还要些计谋才能让他反我
I thought it would take strategy to turn him against me,

615
00:47:08,902 --> 00:47:11,402
他肯定是在朱莉娅死的时候就决心与我为敌了
but he must have turned the moment Julia died.

616
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:13,832
亏他这段时间还在元老院维护你
And all the while he was defending you in the Senate.

617
00:47:13,902 --> 00:47:17,463
他滑的像条沙丁鱼，可怜的傻瓜
He has the cunning of a sardine, poor fool.

618
00:47:18,803 --> 00:47:20,703
斗争开始了
The battle begins.

619
00:47:21,733 --> 00:47:23,863
是时候了
Abouttime.

620
00:47:40,635 --> 00:47:42,705
是波卡·朱诺
Porca Juno.

621
00:47:44,735 --> 00:47:46,405
“最亲爱的庞贝
"Dearest Pompey,

622
00:47:46,465 --> 00:47:49,306
我想这个是你的人
I believe the enclosed man belongs to you.

623
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,736
事先告诉你，我已决定
A quick note to tell you I have decided to winter

624
00:47:51,806 --> 00:47:54,906
带13军团驻扎到靠近家乡的拉文纳过冬
the 13th Legion closer to home, at Ravenna,

625
00:47:54,966 --> 00:47:59,307
所以很快我就能当面问候你了”
so I shall soon have the pleasure of paying you homage in person."

626
00:48:02,867 --> 00:48:04,447
庞贝！庞贝！

627
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:33,910
各位，这是我的新夫人，科妮莉亚
All of you, this is my new wife, Cornelia.

628
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:43,571
如果你能施展一点魅力
Maybe if you'd summoned a little charm

629
00:48:43,641 --> 00:48:46,611
而不是像头迟钝的老母牛一样老苦着一张脸
instead of moping about like some torpid old she-cow,

630
00:48:46,671 --> 00:48:48,711
 这种事就不会发生  哦，我的天哪！
 this would never have happened.  Oh, my dear!

631
00:48:58,512 --> 00:49:02,912
别这样，我只是在说气话
Please, I was only speaking in anger.

632
00:49:02,912 --> 00:49:05,513
每个人都知道你被拒绝是出于政治上的原因
Everyone knows it's a political repudiation on account

633
00:49:05,573 --> 00:49:08,073
庞贝和恺撒现在是敌人了
Pompey and Caesar are enemies now.

634
00:49:09,273 --> 00:49:11,273
看看我的科妮莉娅
One only has to look at Cornelia.

635
00:49:11,343 --> 00:49:13,473
她像只可怜的伤心的小鸡，被人拔了毛，煮了
Poor sad chicken, plucked and boiled.

636
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:18,074
也许格雷毕斯还会要我
Maybe Glabius will take me back.

637
00:49:19,844 --> 00:49:22,374
我们好不容易把他甩掉了
we are well rid of him.

638
00:49:22,744 --> 00:49:26,015
我们要给你找个比格雷毕斯的利用价值大得多的人
We're going to find you somebody much more worthwhile than Glabius.

639
00:49:26,075 --> 00:49:29,245
我已经在全城人面前够丢脸，蒙羞的了
I've been dishonored and shamed before the whole city!

640
00:49:29,315 --> 00:49:31,115
胡说！
Nonsense!

641
00:49:31,115 --> 00:49:33,175
一个上等家庭出生的女孩子的好名声
A girl from a good family can never be dishonored

642
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:35,615
决不会被一个像庞贝那样的险恶的下等人所玷污
by a villainous little pleb like Pompey!

643
00:49:35,675 --> 00:49:37,516
决不…
No...

644
00:49:37,576 --> 00:49:41,176
整件事在别人眼里看起来像个傻子一样的人，是我！
it is I who has been made to look foolish.

645
00:49:41,246 --> 00:49:45,576
 丢脸的人是我！  我想让他死
 It is I who have lost face!  I want him dead.

646
00:49:45,646 --> 00:49:47,217
我想他死
I want him dead.

647
00:49:51,017 --> 00:49:53,247
你的心愿一定会实现的
And that you shall have.

648
00:49:57,748 --> 00:50:00,548
庞贝要为此付出代价
Pompey will eat sand for this.

649
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:06,548

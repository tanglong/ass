1
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:53,784
又有三个人今早跑了
Three more gone this morning.

2
00:01:54,974 --> 00:01:57,513
都是贱民
Outcasts and idiots.

3
00:01:57,543 --> 00:02:00,202
他们都变得躁动不安，在战争结束的时候
They all get restless. With the fighting done,

4
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:01,962
他们都想满载金币回家
they want to be home with money in their pockets,

5
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:05,371
而不是静坐在这种令人消沉的寒冷又潮湿的地方
not sitting in this dismal cold and wet.

6
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:07,361
优良的战士都没有跑
None of the good men have run.

7
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:09,050
他们也不会
Nor will they.

8
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,620
他们也不会跟随你到罗马
Nor will they follow you to Rome.

9
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,329
只是时候未到
Not yet.

10
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:15,339
时间不多了
Time is running out.

11
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:18,718
我们不能永远等在这里
We cannot wait here forever.

12
00:02:18,798 --> 00:02:21,777
现在是非常时期
This is a very precarious position.

13
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:25,916
当一月份到来，你任职期限到期时，会发生什么？
What happens in January when your term runs out

14
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:28,986
难道我们还坐在这里？
and we're still sitting here?

15
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:34,614
去鼓动战士们打仗是一件微妙的事情，波卡
The business of motivating men to fight is a tricky matter, Posca.

16
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,683
我不期望一个奴隶能够明白其中的奥秘
I would not expect a slave to understand the subtleties.

17
00:02:38,763 --> 00:02:43,952
我相信他们很快就会懂了
I trust an education in these subtleties will begin shortly.

18
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:49,071
500,000？这是什么？
500,000? What's this?

19
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:51,610
我提名马克·安东尼竞选护民官
I put Mark Antony up for election as People's Tribune.

20
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,470
所以需要买很多人的选票
There were a lot of votes needed buying.

21
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,079
让马克·安东尼当护民管？
Mark Antony for People's Tribune?

22
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:59,718
但他
But he is--

23
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:02,128
尽管说
 um...  You may speak.

24
00:03:02,188 --> 00:03:04,807
我明白护民管是一个很神圣的职位
I had understood the Tribune to be a sacred office

25
00:03:04,857 --> 00:03:07,137
拥有否决元老院的权利
with the power of veto over the Senate.

26
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:11,586
当然，一个非常高贵庄严的职位
So it is. An office of great dignity and seriousness.

27
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:13,515
可能你是对的
Perhaps you're right.

28
00:03:14,165 --> 00:03:18,934
我们将会派斯特雷波前去确定安东尼行为良好
We shall send Strabo along to make sure Antony behaves himself.

29
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:33,690
还有多远？
How far now?

30
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,470
还有三个小时的路程
Three hours at pace.

31
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,609
嘿！女孩们，我来了
Ah-hi! Here I come, girls.

32
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:39,959
我要在城里喝遍所有的酒, 吸遍所有的烟
I'm going to drink all the wine, smoke all the smoke

33
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,158
还要操遍所有的妓女
 and fuck every whore in the city.

34
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:44,338
保持一点尊严，你还不够格
  Show some dignity.  You're under the standard.

35
00:03:44,368 --> 00:03:46,387
那好，去跟他说
 Well, talk to him.

36
00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:51,076
他不在此列
He's not under the standard.

37
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:53,646
还有三小时某人就能见到八年没见面的妻子了
Three hours away from a wife he hasn't seen in eight years.

38
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:57,175
他害怕了，重聚当然是令人高兴的
 The man's terrified.  Surely a reunion is a happy event.

39
00:03:57,205 --> 00:03:58,825
 谈些其他的  害怕了吧
 Talk of something else.  Terrified.

40
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:01,764
万一她已经掉牙了？ 又或者变得骨瘦如材了？
What if she's lost her teeth? What if she's gotten skinny?

41
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:03,733
万一她有同别的男人上过床了？
What if she's been letting other men between her legs?

42
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,437
肃静！
Silence!

43
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:43,024
他们喜欢他，对吗？ 没关系
 They love him, eh?  No matter.

44
00:04:43,064 --> 00:04:45,124
我们都是有地位的人
We are all men of substance.

45
00:04:45,164 --> 00:04:48,703
让他们去拥有平民和穷人的爱戴吧
Let them have the love of the plebs and the proles.

46
00:04:58,141 --> 00:04:59,890
这不会持续很久，对吧？
This won't take long, will it?

47
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,790
希望如此，上帝
We can hope, Dominus.

48
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,989
 乌瑞纳斯，你可以解散他们了  遵命
 vorenus, you may dismiss the men.  Sir.

49
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:07,948
然后你自己也解散，直到我有任务给你
And then you may dismiss yourself until I send for you.

50
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:09,408
去找点乐子
Have some fun.

51
00:05:09,438 --> 00:05:12,717
但首先，带着个男孩回
But first, take the boy back to Atia.

52
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:14,917
拿回你们的报酬
Get your reward, eh?

53
00:05:14,957 --> 00:05:19,416
孩子，告诉你可爱的母亲，我呆会儿会去见她
Boy, tell your lovely mother I will see her later.

54
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:22,755
让我们把这些办完
Let's get this over with.

55
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,256
Shh!

56
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:40,461
你，现在马上离开这屋！
You, leave this house this moment.

57
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:42,730
我不会，屋大维是我名正言顺的妻子
I will not. Octavia is my rightful wife.

58
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,010
 你敢违抗恺撒？  恺撒算什么！
 You defy Caesar?  A fig for Caesar!

59
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,359
以五复仇女神的名义，如果我不是一位上流社会的女士
By the five furies, if I were not a genteel woman,

60
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,908
我会将你的皮剥掉，然后吊起来挂在门上
I would have you flayed and hung from a bracket at the door!

61
00:05:50,938 --> 00:05:52,518
卡斯特？ 什么事，主人？
 Castor?  Domina?

62
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:54,817
把狗牵来
Fetch the dogs!

63
00:05:58,347 --> 00:06:00,806
傲慢无耻的卑鄙小人！
Insolent wretch!

64
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:03,425
我告诉你，亲爱的，你已经和那人没有任何关系了
I tell you, my honey, you are well rid of that one.

65
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:04,665
我恨你
I hate you.

66
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:06,955
我恨你！我恨你！
I hate you! I hate you!

67
00:06:07,674 --> 00:06:09,684
愚蠢的女孩
Silly girl.

68
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:23,951
我仅仅是尽全力为她着想，为什么她不明白？
I'm only trying to do my best for her. Why can't she see that?

69
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:24,840
她还小
She is young.

70
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,810
屋大维主人驾到！ 我亲爱的孩子！
 Master Octavian!  Baby boy!

71
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,109
我可怜的小兔崽子！
My poor rabbit!

72
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,214
Oh!

73
00:06:33,808 --> 00:06:37,757
真瘦，旅途很艰辛吧！
So thin. Was it very horrible?

74
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,357
当然，我想都不敢想
Of course it was, I can't even imagine.

75
00:06:39,387 --> 00:06:40,847
我们不要再谈论这个了
We shan't even talk about it.

76
00:06:40,877 --> 00:06:43,626
就把旅途的事完完全全的抛在脑后
We should just put it totally out of our minds.

77
00:06:43,676 --> 00:06:46,215
现在的安全到家就好了
You're back safe at home now.

78
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:50,784
那些人是谁？
But who are those?

79
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:52,594
你应该对他们非常好，母亲
You are to be very good to them, Mother.

80
00:06:52,624 --> 00:06:54,793
他们是我特殊的朋友
They are particular friends of mine.

81
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:57,233
朋友？怎样特殊？
Friends? In what particular?

82
00:06:57,463 --> 00:07:00,062
是他们把被囚禁的我给解救出来的
These are the men that took me from captivity.

83
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:03,321
首先是枪兵百夫长，卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯
First Spear Centurion Lucius Vorenus.

84
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:06,411
这位是兵团士兵，泰特斯·波罗
And LegionaryTitus Pullo.

85
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,650
我们欢迎你们
So, we embrace you.

86
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,679
你们真叫人敬畏
Good fearsome specimens you are.

87
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:14,769
我想你们征服那些讨厌的高卢人一定花了很长时间吧
I wonder it took you so long to subdue those odious Gauls.

88
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,838
他们人数非常多，夫人
There was a great many of them, ma'am.

89
00:07:16,878 --> 00:07:19,458
非常多…不错
Great many- very good.

90
00:07:19,508 --> 00:07:20,677
那我们就走了，女士
We'll be away then, sir.

91
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,647
噢，但在你们走之前，你们一定要接受嘉赏
Oh, but you must be rewarded before you go.

92
00:07:22,677 --> 00:07:25,116
 卡斯特，把我的钱包拿来  那不必要
 Castor, bring me my purse.  That won't be necessary.

93
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,976
不行吗？我没有破坏你们的纪律
Will it not? I don't want to break any regulations--

94
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:28,295
他们应该留下来吃点东西，母亲
They shall stay and eat, Mother.

95
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:30,435
当然，面包和肉都在厨房里面
Of course! There shall be bread and meat put out in the kitchen.

96
00:07:30,475 --> 00:07:32,155
我指他们应该和我们一同进餐
I mean, they shall eat with us.

97
00:07:32,474 --> 00:07:36,154
遵命，先生，但我要去找我的妻子
Obliged, sir, but I must go to my wife.

98
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:38,953
你妻子已经等了八年，可以多等一下
Your wife has waited eight years. She can wait a little longer.

99
00:07:39,143 --> 00:07:41,112
凯撒已经给了他们荣誉坐骑
Caesar has given them honorary horses,

100
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:42,632
他们还骑着马，拿着军旗回来
and they ride with the standard.

101
00:07:42,652 --> 00:07:45,451
和他们一同进餐是完全可以接受的
It's perfectly acceptable to eat with them.

102
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:47,461
真是绝妙的主意
Splendid idea.

103
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:52,400
值得纪念，我们今晚将平等的享受晚餐
It's symbolic. We shall all dine together as equals.

104
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:58,888
那是什么声音？ 哦，那是你妹妹
 What's that?  Oh, it's just your sister.

105
00:07:58,908 --> 00:08:01,138
 他没事吧？  妇女之事
 Is she all right?  Women's troubles.

106
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:03,497
哭哭就好了
Nothing a good leeching won't cure.

107
00:08:12,185 --> 00:08:16,484
朱庇特·凡尔格神啊，我们请求你指引并保护这个人
Jupiter Fulgor, we ask you to guide and protect this man,

108
00:08:16,514 --> 00:08:20,543
马克·安东尼，新任护民管
Marcus Antonius, newly elected Tribune of plebs,

109
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:23,093
以及人民的英雄
champion of the people.

110
00:08:23,143 --> 00:08:24,982
总共杀了多少人？
How many dead altogether?

111
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:29,041
我不知道，早就数不清了
I don't know. I lost count ages ago.

112
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:31,071
不过很多
Lots though.

113
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:32,230
那你喃，卢西尔斯？
And you, Lucius?

114
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,350
309个战士，没有算过有多少平民
309 fighting men. I don't keep count on civilians.

115
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,619
你记得真清楚 战争神殿需要你在
 You're very exact.  The war temple requires

116
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:39,599
供奉时给一个具体的数目
an exact number when you make an offering.

117
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:41,908
那就意味着要捐很多的酒和羊
That's a lot of wine and goats.

118
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:46,367
如果你超过100,牧师们会给你些折扣
The priests offer a discount when you pass 100.

119
00:08:46,397 --> 00:08:48,377
牧师！他们多数都是骗子
Priests! Crooks, many of them.

120
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:51,056
要是我，我就直接同上帝对话
I just talk direct to whatever God I'm doing business with.

121
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:53,076
作呕的牧师！
Bugger the priests!

122
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,145
很少有人会在意
Too few people can be bothered to do things

123
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:57,545
以正统的罗马方式来处理事情
the proper, all-Roman way.

124
00:08:57,585 --> 00:09:00,814
我对你的做法表示欣赏，卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯是位严格的卡托追随者
 I commend you, Lucius.  vorenus is a strict Catonian.

125
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:02,673
我相信共和国的神灵
I believe in the divinity of the Republic.

126
00:09:02,703 --> 00:09:06,612
如果卡托和我的信仰一样，那我想我应该就是他的追随者
If Cato believes the same, then I suppose I am a Catonian.

127
00:09:06,652 --> 00:09:09,272
但卡托代表的是贵族们的权利
But Cato represents the rights of the nobility.

128
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:13,151
像你这样的平民肯定希望能发生一些改变
Surely a plebian like yourself would like to see some changes made.

129
00:09:13,211 --> 00:09:16,220
在共和国成立时是什么样，现在就应该是什么样
It should remain as it was at the founding of the Republic.

130
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,449
为什么要改变它？
Why should that change?

131
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,048
因为罗马人民在受苦
Because the Roman people are suffering.

132
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,419
因为奴隶们要做所有的活
Because slaves have taken all the work.

133
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:23,708
因为贵族们占有了所有的地
Because nobles have taken all the land,

134
00:09:23,738 --> 00:09:26,158
而且遍街都是无家可归和饥饿的人们
and the streets are full of the homeless and the starving.

135
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,397
噢，我还不知道我的孩子是这样的一个煽动者
Well, I had no idea my son was such a firebrand.

136
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:30,547
贵族们说凯撒是个战犯
The nobles say that Caesar is a war criminal.

137
00:09:30,577 --> 00:09:33,146
他们说他想要踏步走回罗马封自己为王
They say that he wishes to march on Rome and make himself king.

138
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,926
那是亵渎神灵的行为，没人会跟随他的
That is sacrilege. No man of honor would follow him.

139
00:09:35,956 --> 00:09:39,665
恩，那我就失礼了，我会说凯撒应该骑着大象冲回这里
Well, I'm no man of honor then, 'cause I say that Caesar should ride in here

140
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:43,614
把庞贝、卡托以及其他那些相当国王的人给压扁
with elephants and squash Pompey and Cato and anybody else that wants it.

141
00:09:43,644 --> 00:09:45,563
去他的法律，我就这样认为
Never mind the law. That's what I say.

142
00:09:45,593 --> 00:09:47,163
你这样说是应为你不仅理智有问题
You say that because you govern your reason

143
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:49,352
还管不住你的嘴
no better than you govern your tongue.

144
00:09:49,392 --> 00:09:52,772
不好意思，是我的错，让大家在喝酒时讨论政治
Forgive me, it's my fault for mixing politics and wine.

145
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:55,951
还要多些丁鲷吗？或来只榛睡鼠？
More tench? A dormouse perhaps?

146
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:57,161
谢谢，我够了
Thank you, I won't.

147
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:58,570
别把我说的放在心上
Don't mind my saying it,

148
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,159
但你们确实不是志同道合的朋友
but you two make unlikely friends.

149
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:04,329
我们不是朋友关系，我是他的上司
We are not friends. I am his superior officer.

150
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:05,848
只是从等级划分来看
By virtue of rank, if nothing else.

151
00:10:05,878 --> 00:10:08,728
你已经说够了！
That is enough from you!

152
00:10:10,897 --> 00:10:12,257
请原谅我们鲁莽的行为，夫人
Please forgive our vulgar ways, madam.

153
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:14,337
我们在你面前显得很不得体
We are not fit for your presence.

154
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:16,896
没关系，和你们的相处让我感到无比高兴
Not at all. I've enjoyed your company immensely.

155
00:10:16,926 --> 00:10:18,675
非常与众不同
It's been most refreshing.

156
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:21,125
如果你同意，我们就…
And with your permission, we shall...

157
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:22,994
离开了
Ieave you.

158
00:10:24,914 --> 00:10:26,674
有空再来玩
Do come and visit us again.

159
00:10:26,714 --> 00:10:29,143
屋大维需要可信赖的朋友
Octavian needs reliable friends.

160
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:30,843
他可能得依靠你们，我相信
He may depend on you, I trust.

161
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:32,702
如你所愿，夫人
As you say, madam.

162
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,299
 再说一次？  我什么都没说
 Say again?  I did not speak.

163
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:46,719
我走这边
I go this way.

164
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,618
我的家就在那条染色坊街的后面，如果你有什么需要…
My home is behind the street of the cloth dyers, if you--

165
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:51,888
祝你好运，长官
Go with fortune, sir.

166
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,427
比较干净点的妓院
The cleaner brothels are in the Suburra,

167
00:10:56,477 --> 00:10:58,716
在性爱神殿旁
next to the venereal Temple.

168
00:11:31,748 --> 00:11:33,228
内奥比
Niobe.

169
00:11:45,295 --> 00:11:47,165
你还活着
You're alive.

170
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:51,824
那是谁的孩子？
What child is that?

171
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:53,973
回答我
Answer me.

172
00:11:54,143 --> 00:11:57,772
那是谁的孩子？
What child is that?

173
00:11:59,242 --> 00:12:00,072
他是你的孙子
He's your grandson.

174
00:12:00,112 --> 00:12:03,161
说话要有逻辑，妓女
Speak sense, whore.

175
00:12:03,441 --> 00:12:05,300
别动
Wait, now.

176
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,020
你的孙子…你女儿的孩子
Your grandson- the son of your daughter.

177
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,039
 我女儿只有…  她都13了，快14了
 My daughter is only-  She's 13, near 14.

178
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:15,478
孩子的父亲是谁？ 一个家禽商人的孩子
 A son by who?  Crito, a Drover's boy.

179
00:12:15,698 --> 00:12:18,977
他的名字是卢西尔斯
His name is Lucius.

180
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:20,887
内奥比，站住
Niobe, stop.

181
00:12:20,927 --> 00:12:23,976
我命令你站住！
I order you to stop!

182
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:30,025
你们的父亲回来了
Your father's home.

183
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,342
女儿们，他就是你们的父亲
Girls, this is your father.

184
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:48,710
女儿们，我真高兴你们这么健康漂亮
Daughters, I'm very pleased to find you healthy and good looking.

185
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,130
你们都喜欢跟你们的妈妈在一起吧，恩？
A benefice you favor your mother, eh?

186
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,009
你们的父亲却如此丑陋
Now you see how ugly your father is.

187
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:55,349
来
Come here.

188
00:12:57,368 --> 00:13:00,118
她不轻信别人，对吧？
She's not simple, is she?

189
00:13:00,188 --> 00:13:03,827
向你们的父亲问好，就像我教你们的那样
Greet your father properly as you've been taught to do.

190
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:48,376
你的薪水一年前就不再寄过来了
Your pay stopped coming a year ago.

191
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:49,796
发钱的人说你一定是挂了
The paymaster said you must be dead.

192
00:13:49,836 --> 00:13:52,595
他们说他们从来不会错
They said they don't make mistakes.

193
00:13:52,835 --> 00:13:56,594
该死的家伙们，我有叫他们寄的
Damned fools! I'll have it seen to.

194
00:13:58,424 --> 00:14:01,463
那见到我一定有点吃惊吧？
A bit of a surprise to see me then?

195
00:14:01,713 --> 00:14:04,942
被叫妓女的却有点吃惊
A bit surprised to be called "whore."

196
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:09,821
我说错了
That was... wrong.

197
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:11,321
对不起
I am sorry for it.

198
00:14:11,371 --> 00:14:15,240
 在大家面前叫我妓女  我说了，对不起
 A whore in front of everybody.  I said sorry.

199
00:14:31,856 --> 00:14:35,725
好吃吗？ 下次少放点盐
 Is it as you like it?  Less salt next time.

200
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:42,744
那，你们怎么挣钱的？
So, how did you manage for money?

201
00:14:42,804 --> 00:14:46,873
我妹妹莱蒂和她丈夫帮助了我们
My sister Lyde and her husband helped us out.

202
00:14:46,923 --> 00:14:50,622
你们不必再靠他们的帮助了
Well, you won't need their help anymore.

203
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,270
那些巨大的阴茎是我从
The big phallus is off a Suevi I killed in the Rhinelands--

204
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,854
强壮的野人身上割下来的
a very strong and fierce people.

205
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,789
不错
Nice.

206
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:05,298
正式的工资都换成奴隶了
My official spoils I've put into slaves.

207
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:07,758
都在市场
They're at the market.

208
00:15:07,898 --> 00:15:11,157
我净赚了10,000便士
I should clear 10,000 denarii.

209
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:14,236
这是个好消息
That's good news.

210
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,423
Come with me, sir.

211
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:02,795
以罗马的恩惠，十二个月亮的名义
By grace of Roma, for twelve moons hence,

212
00:16:02,825 --> 00:16:06,004
在此赋予你护民管的职位
thou art Tribune of Plebs.

213
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:08,898
终于好了
Abouttime.

214
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:12,393
我需要喝些酒 当然，长官
 I need a drink.  lndeed, sir.

215
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:14,972
不过可能得先开会
Perhaps after the meeting.

216
00:16:15,012 --> 00:16:15,992
西赛罗
Cicero.

217
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:19,981
我亲爱的阿提娅，真荣幸
My dear Atia, a pleasure.

218
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,940
原谅我们选择这样不恰当的时间
Forgive us for imposing at such a ludicrous hour.

219
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:27,429
没关系，我非常喜欢这种神秘的气氛 十分令人激动
Not at all, I adore it. The secrecy, the intrigue- it's most thrilling.

220
00:16:27,469 --> 00:16:31,048
请明白，女人，这是一次机密的会议
Comprehend, woman, this meeting is invisible.

221
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:34,467
请放心，卡托，我看不见你
Be assured, Cato, I do not see you.

222
00:16:38,726 --> 00:16:39,976
安东尼将军，我们正…
General Antony, we are--

223
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:43,635
噢，上帝啊，你的美丽真叫人痛苦
Oh God, your beauty is painful.

224
00:16:43,685 --> 00:16:47,134
你是将维纳斯钉死的十字架
You are the crucifix of venus.

225
00:16:48,284 --> 00:16:50,504
让我在你怀中死去吧
Let me die in your arms.

226
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:52,853
安东尼
'Sist, Antony.

227
00:16:52,963 --> 00:16:55,652
大家晚上好，安东尼将军？
 Good evening to you all.  General Antony.

228
00:16:55,692 --> 00:16:58,342
请叫我安东尼护民管
Tribune Antony, if you please.

229
00:16:58,382 --> 00:17:01,321
你现在身处罗马里神圣的地方
You're inside the sacred precincts of Rome,

230
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:04,070
但你却仍然披着你那件血红的战士披风
but yet you wear the bloody red cloak of a soldier.

231
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,380
Che brutta figura!

232
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,089
我完全没有注意到
It completely fell from my mind.

233
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:13,478
我向你们致以最深厚的歉意 你们会原谅我吗，我的好友卡托？
I'm most extremely sorry. Will you forgive me, friend Cato?

234
00:17:14,128 --> 00:17:16,747
阿提娅，请把这个拿去烧掉
Atia, please, will you take this and burn it?

235
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:20,387
没这个必要，是吗？
 That's not necessary.  Is it not? Oh, bene.

236
00:17:20,437 --> 00:17:24,486
那我们不要再说废话，直接切入正题吧
Then let's stop all this blathering and get down to business.

237
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:26,365
你说那些是废话？
Blathering you say?

238
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:29,694
真是有活力的英雄！
What a congerie of heroes. Such vim!

239
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:32,004
我感觉自己就像特洛伊的海伦
I feel like Helen of Troy.

240
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:34,173
你们改到庭院中开会，怎样？
Would you adjourn to the courtyard?

241
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:37,063
说吧，年轻的马克，你有什么可以告诉我们的？
Speak, young Marcus. What have you to tell us?

242
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:40,842
我被凯撒任命前来谈判妥协条约
I have been delegated by Caesar to negotiate a compromise.

243
00:17:40,882 --> 00:17:42,801
凯撒希望避免发生流血冲突
Caesar wishes to avoid bloodshed.

244
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:46,281
他希望别人觉得他是个和情合理的人
He wishes to be seen as a man of reason and probity.

245
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:49,310
所以，当他在高卢的统制任期结束时
Therefore, when his present term as governor of Gaul has ended,

246
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,189
他愿意接受统制一个军团省份的权利
he is willing to accept command of a single legion province.

247
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:55,538
优先考虑伊利里亚
Illyria, by preference.

248
00:17:55,568 --> 00:17:59,627
 我不明白  统制一个省份
 I don't understand.  Command of a province--

249
00:17:59,657 --> 00:18:01,417
这样他才会有合法的豁免权
so he will have legal immunity.

250
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:05,536
才不至于被你们这些下贱小人给拖到法庭去
So that none of you rascals can go dragging him through the courts.

251
00:18:05,576 --> 00:18:11,825
我们在这里谈论的是凯撒辞职的条件
We're here to discuss the terms of Caesar's resignation.

252
00:18:11,855 --> 00:18:14,364
他可以避免受到起诉
He could have avoided prosecution

253
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,693
只要他肯接受几年时间的流放
by accepting a few years banishment.

254
00:18:16,743 --> 00:18:18,373
为什么而流放？
Banishment for what?

255
00:18:18,403 --> 00:18:19,963
为鼓动专治政权
For fomenting a tyranny.

256
00:18:19,993 --> 00:18:22,512
违法战争，偷窃
Illegal warfare, theft,

257
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:24,761
谋杀，以及叛国！
murder, treason!

258
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:27,271
那你会受到什么惩罚，庞贝？
And what shall be your punishment, Pompey,

259
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:28,901
背弃朋友
for betraying a friend,

260
00:18:28,931 --> 00:18:30,510
抛弃你的人民的利益
for deserting the cause of your people,

261
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,260
还有和这些所谓的贵族结盟
for allying yourself with these so-called noblemen.

262
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:37,349
你会为这些受到怎样的惩罚喃？ 放肆，狗崽子！
 What punishment for you?  lmpudent whelp!

263
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:40,828
凯撒的任职期还有两周到期
The man's term of office ends in two weeks.

264
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:44,167
 我们说还有六个月  两周！
 We say six months.  Two weeks!

265
00:18:44,217 --> 00:18:46,076
他独自一人坐在拉文纳
He sits alone in Ravenna

266
00:18:46,096 --> 00:18:48,696
陪伴他的是一群反叛军团
with one mutinous skeleton of a legion

267
00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:51,215
他居然还敢向我谈条件？！
and he dares to dictate terms to me?!

268
00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:54,145
凯撒不止只有第十三军团
Caesar has many more legions than the 1 3th.

269
00:18:54,185 --> 00:18:56,134
在阿尔卑斯山遥远的另一边
On the far side of the Alps.

270
00:18:56,174 --> 00:18:58,254
冬季不会持续太久
Winter does not last forever.

271
00:18:58,284 --> 00:19:01,153
春天到来，雪便融化
Spring comes, snows melt.

272
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,922
 这是在威胁！  请放心，这不是威胁
 That's a threat!  I assure you, it is no threat.

273
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:07,541
雪总会融化
Snows always melt.

274
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:09,411
如果他得不到他的省
If he does not get a province?

275
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:13,850
那凯撒就会采取一切必要措施
Caesar will take all measures required

276
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,019
来保护他自己的
to protect both his interests

277
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:17,659
以及共和国的利益
and those of the Republic.

278
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,069
我真为此感到难过惊讶
I am grieved and surprised.

279
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:24,038
我还以为这次会是一次合情合理的谈判
I had hoped we would have a rational negotiation.

280
00:19:24,088 --> 00:19:27,797
如果他没有其他要说的了，那我们就走了
If that is his last word, we shall go.

281
00:19:31,376 --> 00:19:33,385
那我们已没什么可谈的了
Then we have no more business.

282
00:19:33,425 --> 00:19:34,805
凯撒只是在虚张声势
Caesar is bluffing.

283
00:19:34,855 --> 00:19:37,784
他只不过装作极度自信
He wishes to appear supremely confident.

284
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:40,514
很明显他现在已经绝望般的虚弱了，比我们想象的还弱
Evidently he is desperately weak, weaker than we'd thought.

285
00:19:40,544 --> 00:19:44,043
这是他最后一次仗着还有操纵军队的权利企图恐吓我们，让我们做出让步
This is a last ditch attempt to frighten us into making concessions,

286
00:19:44,073 --> 00:19:46,232
虽然它还有军队在虚张声势
while he still has the semblance of an army.

287
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:48,522
他现在很虚弱，西赛罗，濒临死亡
He's weak, Cicero. Dying.

288
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:52,101
那现在不正是所有谚语提醒我们该谨慎的时候吗？
Is that not when all the proverbs tell us to be wary?

289
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:56,270
临死的毒蛇不是咬得最狠吗？
Does not the dying serpent bite deepest?

290
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:15,745
让我们来玩吧
Let's play.

291
00:20:15,785 --> 00:20:18,495
 你从那里来，朋友？  第十三军团
 Where are you from, friend?  1 3th.

292
00:20:18,525 --> 00:20:20,734
你最好不要到处宣扬
Better keep that quiet.

293
00:20:20,774 --> 00:20:23,204
这里庞贝的地盘
This is deep Pompeian territory.

294
00:20:23,234 --> 00:20:26,083
我们不都是罗马人吗？
So, we're all Romans, eh?

295
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:37,350
来啊，女士们，现在起听我的
Come on, ladies, hear me now.

296
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,350
复仇女神和河神，来个五
Furies and River Gods for five.

297
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:28,558
你会高兴的听到
"You will be pleased to hear

298
00:21:28,598 --> 00:21:31,908
安东尼将军还是如人们所想象的一样傲慢
that General Antony was as blithely arrogant

299
00:21:31,948 --> 00:21:35,957
具有挑衅性
and provocative as one could hope for.

300
00:21:36,886 --> 00:21:39,746
你的谈判立场把庞贝和卡托
And Pompey and Cato were deeply offended

301
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:42,655
给深深地得罪了
by your negotiating position."

302
00:21:43,555 --> 00:21:46,544
聪明的希腊人保佑我，四点！
Wise Men and Graces on four!

303
00:21:48,164 --> 00:21:50,003
我想希腊人不喜欢你
Those Graces don't like you, I think.

304
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:53,802
 他们在你脸上撒尿  他们在我脸上撒尿？
 They piss on your face.  They piss on my face?

305
00:21:53,932 --> 00:21:57,332
 他们在我脸上撒尿？！  冷静，兄弟
 They piss on my face?!  Calm, brother.

306
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,621
他没有被人好好管教过
Man has an ill way with him.

307
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:03,760
他输了很多钱，他没有冒犯的意思
He's lost a lot of money. He means no offense...

308
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,350
是吧？ 一点都没有
 do you?  None at all.

309
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:11,158
孪生河神啊，一对二
Twin River Gods over two.

310
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:13,858
来吧，你这个滑头！
Come on, you mumping cunnies!

311
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:24,425
一对四
Graces... over four.

312
00:22:28,744 --> 00:22:32,643
现在感觉怎么样，士兵？感觉不错？
How do you feel now, soldier? Feel good?

313
00:23:49,115 --> 00:23:51,405
 这人是谁？  快去叫医生！
 Who is this man?  Run and get a doctor!

314
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:52,834
 我不希望有人在这屋里死去！
I don't want people dying in my house!

315
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,422
 照我说的做，女人！
Do as I say, woman!

316
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:17,586
Oh!

317
00:25:17,635 --> 00:25:22,254
会有很多浓汁，首先是腐烂的，流完后便会康复
There will be copious pus- first putrid, then wholesome--

318
00:25:22,304 --> 00:25:24,833
可能还有些坏脾气
and mayhap fits of the spleen,

319
00:25:24,863 --> 00:25:27,722
但都是有好处的
but that will be all to the good.

320
00:25:27,782 --> 00:25:30,932
跟着会清除
A purging of the malignancy will follow.

321
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:33,101
这个是铜币
This is brass.

322
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,200
来
Come.

323
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,980
他什么时候会醒？
When will he wake up?

324
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,119
今天，明天，也许再也不会了
Today, tomorrow, maybe never.

325
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:47,918
你应该试试去供奉
You might try an offering to Spes.

326
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:50,657
供奉小白兔常常有用
A white rabbit often works.

327
00:25:50,707 --> 00:25:54,386
我明天会派我的徒弟来检查药剂
I'll send my boy tomorrow to check the dressings.

328
00:25:57,335 --> 00:25:59,535
真是不幸！ 不过是血
 What misery!  It's only blood.

329
00:25:59,575 --> 00:26:01,554
洗洗就干净了
It'll wash.

330
00:26:02,384 --> 00:26:03,604
你上哪去？
Where are you going?

331
00:26:03,654 --> 00:26:05,593
我有正事要办
I have business.

332
00:26:05,653 --> 00:26:08,123
正事？什么正事？
Business? What business?

333
00:26:09,163 --> 00:26:11,172
我明白你很焦虑，但我要求你
I understand that you are upset, but I will ask you

334
00:26:11,212 --> 00:26:14,291
不要以这种语气询问我
do not question me in that tone.

335
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,090
语气
Tone.

336
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,439
我爸的公鸡！
My father's cock!

337
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,959
用它的音调怎么样！
How's that for tone?!

338
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,708
50, 50. 55.

339
00:26:28,758 --> 00:26:31,707
55, 55. 60.

340
00:26:31,747 --> 00:26:33,811
60,60…成交！
60, 60- sold!

341
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:37,283
40. 40, 40, 45.

342
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,924
45, 45, 45. 50.

343
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,333
50. 50, 50. 55.

344
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:49,073
这是一个好市场，但都是些骨瘦如材的
This is bona stock, but it's all skin and bone, eh?

345
00:26:49,113 --> 00:26:51,043
你想想要个好价钱
You want a good price.

346
00:26:51,113 --> 00:26:54,262
让我们给他们食物吃，给他们增点肥
Let us feed them up, put some fat on them.

347
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:58,351
只需要几周的小康生活，这些奴隶就会卖得和鹅心一样好
Couple weeks of easy living, and these puppies will sell like duck hearts.

348
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:00,351
买食物以及储存食物会很贵吗？
Is that expensive, fodder and storage?

349
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:04,010
不！你会赚回你花在食物上的钱的两倍
No! You'll recoup feed and storage double.

350
00:27:10,578 --> 00:27:13,328
漂亮，对吧？一个真实的表演者
Beautiful, neh? A real showman.

351
00:27:13,358 --> 00:27:16,097
我虽然不是万能的
I am no judge of the sand,

352
00:27:16,157 --> 00:27:18,836
但肯定每个人都能看到
but sure, anyone can see

353
00:27:18,876 --> 00:27:23,765
他是稀有的强壮，充满攻击性
he is rare large and aggressive.

354
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,524
当明天的元老院会议召开
When the Senate meets tomorrow,

355
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:32,283
西比乌会提议一项对凯撒的终结方案
Scipio will propose an ultimatum be put to Caesar.

356
00:27:32,323 --> 00:27:35,642
我以朋友的身份，希望你明天支持这项方案
I ask you as a friend to support the proposal

357
00:27:35,692 --> 00:27:38,072
并吩咐你的朋友们都来支持
and to enjoin your many friends to do the same.

358
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,331
哦，我并没有多少朋友
Oh, I have not so many friends as all that.

359
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:44,040
啊，温和派像绵羊一样跟随你
Ah, the moderates follow you like sheep.

360
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,630
你的选票非常关键，最终方案是？
 Your vote is critical.  The ultimatum is?

361
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,999
凯撒的任职期一结束
Caesar's term of office is over.

362
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,209
他必须马上解散他的军队
He must immediately disband his men,

363
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:53,938
辞去他的指挥权，并回来接受审判…
resign his command, and return for trial--

364
00:27:53,968 --> 00:27:57,997
不然的话，他就被当作是元老院和人民的敌人
else be considered an Enemy of the Senate and People of Rome.

365
00:27:58,027 --> 00:28:00,526
但他不会接受的
But he cannot accept that.

366
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:01,906
那让他身败名裂
Not without dishonor.

367
00:28:01,936 --> 00:28:05,755
一但宣布敌对，他便没有什么可以失去的了…他便会不顾一切的战斗
Once declared hostile, he has nothing to lose- he will fight at any cost.

368
00:28:05,795 --> 00:28:07,385
他会宣布战争！
You are declaring war!

369
00:28:07,425 --> 00:28:11,104
轮不到凯撒决定
Caesar will not have to accept or refuse the terms,

370
00:28:11,134 --> 00:28:15,083
马克·安东尼会直接否决
because Mark Antony will immediately use Tribune's veto.

371
00:28:15,113 --> 00:28:16,483
你的意图是？
But then, what is your purpose?

372
00:28:16,523 --> 00:28:18,452
如果议会反对他
If the Senate votes against him,

373
00:28:18,492 --> 00:28:20,952
恺撒会明白
Caesar will finally understand

374
00:28:20,992 --> 00:28:24,011
他只有孤身一人
that he is alone against all.

375
00:28:24,051 --> 00:28:26,400
除了一张否决票
Of course, anything but an overwhelming vote

376
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,030
让恺撒觉得还有希望
encourages Caesar to think he still has friends and hope.

377
00:28:35,698 --> 00:28:38,518
我不是恺撒的朋友
I am no friend to Caesar, nor any tyrant,

378
00:28:38,548 --> 00:28:40,377
谈我不会否决提议
but I cannot vote for a proposal

379
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:44,066
那样太没有信仰了
I do not wish to see realized. It would be highly irreligious.

380
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,016
我向朱庇特宣过誓
I have made a vow to Jupiter.

381
00:28:46,046 --> 00:28:49,165
除非明天我能获得全部议员的支持
Unless I get the full backing of the Senate tomorrow,

382
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:52,284
否则我就把我全部的军团带去西班牙
I and all my legions will sail for Spain

383
00:28:52,324 --> 00:28:56,463
让你们这帮绅士自生自灭
and leave you gentlemen to your own defenses.

384
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:08,501
这就是他？
This is he? Crito?

385
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:10,600
他是个好孩子
He's a good boy from good family.

386
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:13,099
好到让大爷我的
Good enough to seed a child of the vorenii

387
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:15,179
女儿怀孕？
who fought at Magnesia and Zama?

388
00:29:15,209 --> 00:29:17,878
我不知道，先生 你不知道？！
 I don't rightly know, sir.  You don't rightly know?!

389
00:29:17,908 --> 00:29:20,218
你不知道她是我的？
Do you know that this girl is my property?

390
00:29:20,248 --> 00:29:21,937
应该先征得我的同意
That you should have asked my permission

391
00:29:21,977 --> 00:29:23,587
在你们乱搞之前？
before you coupled with her?

392
00:29:23,627 --> 00:29:27,746
对不起  我现在就有杀你的权利
 I'm sorry, sir.  I am within my rights to kill you here and now.

393
00:29:27,786 --> 00:29:30,445
爸爸，别，别现在才这样
 Papa, please.  Don't you start sniffling.

394
00:29:30,485 --> 00:29:32,485
你被搞之前应该先想到这些
You should have thought of this before you spread your legs.

395
00:29:32,515 --> 00:29:34,854
他们没有要侮辱你
They meant you no disrespect.

396
00:29:34,924 --> 00:29:36,084
他们做的很正常
What they did was only natural.

397
00:29:36,124 --> 00:29:37,964
他们年轻，又相爱着对方
They're young and they love each other.

398
00:29:37,994 --> 00:29:39,453
还是不可容忍
That's no excuse.

399
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:42,183
他妈妈家里很有钱
His mother's family are well-found in Ostia for many generations,

400
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:45,482
他爸爸又是很成功的商人
and his father is a successful drover.

401
00:29:46,482 --> 00:29:48,481
他们家就在街对面
They have a house in the southern crossroads.

402
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:50,591
房间里肯定都是牛粪
A house built from cattle dung no doubt.

403
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:53,560
那里很干净，一点味道都没有
It's very hygienic, sir. There's no smell.

404
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,760
Huh!

405
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:58,169
至少家畜商还有钱赚
There's money in droving, at least.

406
00:29:58,199 --> 00:29:59,729
很多钱
Good money, sir.

407
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:02,118
对于我来说…
I'm on the Capua run mostly--

408
00:30:02,148 --> 00:30:05,637
一星期至少5,000
that's 5,000 head a week sometimes, sir.

409
00:30:06,327 --> 00:30:08,946
不可思议，你什么时候成人？
He cannot be but what he is. When are you a man?

410
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:12,256
下个月，先生 下个月
 Next month, sir.  Next month.

411
00:30:15,395 --> 00:30:17,844
很好，下个月你和我女儿成婚
very well, you may marry my daughter.

412
00:30:17,884 --> 00:30:22,573
和你家人讲准备好嫁妆
Assure your good people that the dowry will be appropriate.

413
00:30:31,451 --> 00:30:33,170
他是个好孩子
He really is a good boy.

414
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:36,131
你应该感到高兴
You should be pleased.

415
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,699
我女儿失去童贞
My daughter's virginity has been taken

416
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:43,918
我第一个孙子居然是穷人的孩子
and my first grandson spawned, by an ill-favored prole.

417
00:30:43,978 --> 00:30:45,828
我怎么能高兴？
How can I be pleased?

418
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:47,657
 他让她开心  她真是个傻瓜
 He makes her happy.  She's an idiot then.

419
00:30:47,687 --> 00:30:49,987
你真残忍！
What a brute you are!

420
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:31,337
议员们，听马赛琉斯说
The Senate will hear Metullus Scipio.

421
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,417
说吧！
Speak! Speak!

422
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:38,315
议员们，我提议
Conscript fathers, I propose a formal motion.

423
00:31:38,345 --> 00:31:41,755
除非盖乌斯·优利乌斯·恺撒
Unless Gaius Julius Caesar

424
00:31:41,795 --> 00:31:44,874
立刻放弃他的指挥权
immediately lays down his command,

425
00:31:44,914 --> 00:31:49,163
解散他的军队然后回罗马
disbands his legions and returns to Rome for trial,

426
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:53,582
否则议会将宣布他是个公敌
this sacred assembly will declare him a public enemy

427
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:56,341
罗马人民的敌人！
of the Senate and People of Rome!

428
00:31:56,381 --> 00:32:00,140
在那之后
After which time it will be the duty

429
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:04,169
那将是所有罗马人的义务
and the obligation of every Roman to do him harm

430
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:07,709
去杀掉他！
or to kill him if they are able!

431
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:19,226
议案已经提出了
A motion is proposed.

432
00:32:19,256 --> 00:32:22,855
同意的请表态
Those in favor, make it known.

433
00:32:55,407 --> 00:33:01,206
议案通过
The motion is carried by clear numbers.

434
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:04,425
安东尼！
Antony!

435
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,825
否决它！
veto the motion!

436
00:33:06,925 --> 00:33:10,554
快否决！
Stand up! veto the motion!

437
00:33:11,903 --> 00:33:16,162
大家安静！大家注意！
I demand the floor! I demand the floor!

438
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,822
听他说！ 我否议案！
 Give him the floor!  I veto the motion!

439
00:33:18,882 --> 00:33:21,751
护民管否决议案！
Tribune vetoes the motion!

440
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,650
西比乌的议案反对凯撒
Scipio's motion against Caesar--

441
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,969
立不住脚，对吗？
it doesn't stand, does it?

442
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:30,579
立的住脚
Stands.

443
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:33,198
记入年报
Entered in the annals.

444
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:37,417
护民官反对也不行？
Despite that Tribune raised his veto?

445
00:33:37,437 --> 00:33:42,026
反对没有成立
Not heard, not fully admitted.

446
00:33:42,206 --> 00:33:43,956
分量不够
No weight.

447
00:33:44,006 --> 00:33:46,775
议案通过
The motion stands.

448
00:33:46,855 --> 00:33:48,925
我跟你讲清楚
Let me be clear with you.

449
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,594
我不希望
I do not wish

450
00:33:50,644 --> 00:33:52,514
这样重要的议案
that a motion as important as this

451
00:33:52,554 --> 00:33:55,493
用这种诡计通过
should stand on a mere trick of procedure.

452
00:33:55,543 --> 00:33:57,623
你说诡计？
Trick, you say?

453
00:33:57,663 --> 00:34:00,162
这是宗教的方式
This is a religious matter.

454
00:34:00,232 --> 00:34:03,711
宗教里容不得诡计
There are no tricks in religion.

455
00:34:05,201 --> 00:34:09,300
会议还没正式结束，对吗？
Session was not formally ended, correct?

456
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:13,929
对，当复会后
 Correct.  So, when we reconvene,

457
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:17,218
还是一样
it will formally be the same session.

458
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:21,454
护民官安东尼可以否决
Then Tribune Antony may use veto on the motion.

459
00:34:28,256 --> 00:34:30,685
是的
That is so.

460
00:34:30,865 --> 00:34:34,594
天后朱庇特！ 老笨蛋
Juno lnferna! Senile old fool,

461
00:34:34,634 --> 00:34:36,544
为什么你一开始不说？
why didn't you say so to begin with?

462
00:34:36,594 --> 00:34:40,753
马克·安东尼不可以收到任何伤害
Mark Antony must not be harmed or hindered in any way.

463
00:34:40,903 --> 00:34:41,512
但是…无论如何
 But-  In any way!

464
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:45,292
让他能否决这个提议，这一点很重要
It is vitally important that he be allowed to veto the motion.

465
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,418
否则，凯撒就成叛国者了
If he does not, Caesar is declared a traitor.

466
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:50,820
他就不得不反对我了
Then he has no choice but to oppose me openly,

467
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:54,229
然后就是战争，马克·安东尼不可以收到任何伤害
which means civil war. Antony must not be harmed!

468
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:56,569
好消息
Dominus, good news.

469
00:34:56,609 --> 00:34:59,678
议会明天复会
The Senate will reconvene tomorrow.

470
00:34:59,718 --> 00:35:01,818
和上次一样
Formally, it is the same session,

471
00:35:01,878 --> 00:35:04,927
所以你明天还可以否决
so you may yet exercise your veto on the motion.

472
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,896
除非庞贝要阻止我
Hmm. Unless Pompey tries to stop me.

473
00:35:07,926 --> 00:35:11,076
很可能
True, he may very well try.

474
00:35:11,405 --> 00:35:13,875
把人们叫齐
Rally the men together.

475
00:35:14,535 --> 00:35:16,364
乌瑞纳斯
vorenus...

476
00:35:16,544 --> 00:35:18,824
所有的人
all of them.

477
00:35:19,633 --> 00:35:22,333
捉迷藏
& Run and hide&

478
00:35:22,643 --> 00:35:25,092
捉迷藏
& Run and hide&

479
00:35:25,622 --> 00:35:28,781
第十三个来了
&The 13th arecoming&

480
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:32,870
你的人都死了！
& And your men are all dead! &

481
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,330
我多加了些肉豆
I put extra nutmeg in, as you like it.

482
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,889
嫁给我吧，女神
Oh, marry me, goddess.

483
00:35:37,939 --> 00:35:41,058
像你这样的肥猪？
What, a porcine object like you?

484
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:44,338
谢天谢地，我已经够惨了
Besides, I am already wed, thanks be to evil spirits.

485
00:35:44,378 --> 00:35:47,657
你错了，他是个好人
You are wrong, friend-wife. He is a good man, your man.

486
00:35:47,747 --> 00:35:49,566
好人？
A good man you say?

487
00:35:49,616 --> 00:35:51,456
这些年来，我每晚都在祈祷
For years and years, I'd lie awake at night

488
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:54,075
让神把他送回来
and beg all the Gods to send him home.

489
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:57,185
我听到这场那场战役
I'd hear of this battle or that battle and...

490
00:35:57,485 --> 00:35:59,244
我能清清楚楚地看到他
I'd see him, clear as a glass,

491
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:02,513
满身血污的躺在地上
Iying dead and bloody in the mud somewhere.

492
00:36:05,113 --> 00:36:06,812
我很孤独
I was lonely.

493
00:36:06,872 --> 00:36:08,962
很孤独
I was so lonely.

494
00:36:09,022 --> 00:36:11,031
八年来我一直哭泣
For eight years I wept.

495
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:15,670
每天孩子们都问，爸爸什么时候回家？
Every day, the girls asking, "When is Papa coming home?

496
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,580
今天吗？
Is it today? When?"

497
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,399
现在他回来了，我却希望他还在高卢
And now he's home, and I wish he was in Gaul.

498
00:36:22,469 --> 00:36:24,178
他真无情无义
He's a cold, mean brute.

499
00:36:24,218 --> 00:36:27,008
对我们连一句亲切的话都不说
Not one loving word to me or his daughters,

500
00:36:27,038 --> 00:36:28,147
一次都没有
not once since he has been home.

501
00:36:28,197 --> 00:36:31,677
他不会哄女人
He is no skilled hand with the women.

502
00:36:31,747 --> 00:36:35,346
不过这些年我跟着他，他一个女人也没动过
But in all these years I fought with him, he never took a woman.

503
00:36:35,386 --> 00:36:38,195
波罗，他对我说：“我的老朋友
"Pullo," he'd say to me, "Pullo, my old friend,

504
00:36:38,235 --> 00:36:40,385
我有个妻子叫内奥比
I have a wife back home, Niobe is her name

505
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:44,124
她比所有高卢的女人都珍贵”
and she's worth more to me than all the women of Gaul."

506
00:36:44,694 --> 00:36:49,003
谢谢你的好心话，但我知道你在说谎
I thank you for your kind words, but I know you lie.

507
00:36:50,142 --> 00:36:52,522
他不是你的朋友，他告诉我了
He's no friend of yours. He told me so.

508
00:36:52,572 --> 00:36:55,421
他脾气不好
Why, he has a- an ill temper, him.

509
00:36:55,461 --> 00:36:57,291
什么都说
He'd say anything.

510
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,780
安东尼需要所有人
Antony needs every man.

511
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,869
如果你能走，去阿提娅集合
If you can walk, we rendezvous at the house of Atia.

512
00:37:12,037 --> 00:37:13,537
就这么多了
This is all I have left.

513
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:16,316
卖掉奴隶后还会有些
There will be more when I sell the slaves.

514
00:37:16,366 --> 00:37:20,475
让孩子们回家，呆在家中知道你认为安全了
Get the girls indoors and stay indoors until you know it's safe.

515
00:37:27,104 --> 00:37:29,773
你不高兴让我很伤心
It saddens me that you are unhappy,

516
00:37:29,823 --> 00:37:32,602
因为我很爱你
because I have a deep affection for you.

517
00:37:33,682 --> 00:37:36,211
我回来后再说吧
When I return, we will talk.

518
00:37:48,978 --> 00:37:52,048
这是件喜事
Well, this is a merry do.

519
00:37:53,877 --> 00:37:57,027
奥克塔维娅，你又有精神了
Octavia, my honey, look alive at least.

520
00:37:57,077 --> 00:38:00,496
可怜的安东尼一定认为自己被忘记了
Poor Antony must think himself dead and swimming in Lethe water.

521
00:38:00,536 --> 00:38:04,735
跟这个可怜的家伙讲讲话
Talk to the poor man, ask him questions.

522
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:07,324
别人还以为你被德国人养大
One would think she'd been raised by Germans.

523
00:38:07,364 --> 00:38:11,773
安东尼，我妈妈的尖叫让你烦吗？
General Antony, does my mother's screaming irritate you?

524
00:38:12,193 --> 00:38:13,302
 你说什么？
Excuse me?

525
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:15,717
 当你们性交的时候
When you and my mother are in coitus,

526
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,402
尖叫声不断
there is a deal of screaming.

527
00:38:17,452 --> 00:38:20,401
我觉得很烦
I find it extremely irritating.

528
00:38:20,441 --> 00:38:23,110
我向你会不会也这样认为呢？
I wondered whether you did also.

529
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,620
也许你很喜欢？
Or perhaps you like it?

530
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,620
证明你的本领
A testament to your skills.

531
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,259
真可恶
So spiteful, and for what?

532
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:30,749
你自己侮辱自己
You shame only yourself.

533
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:59,122
正让她说中了
She has you exact.

534
00:39:00,392 --> 00:39:01,881
让他们见识我们的力量
We show our strength.

535
00:39:01,921 --> 00:39:03,821
告诉他们这儿谁说了算
We show them who owns the Forum,

536
00:39:03,871 --> 00:39:05,780
但不要碰他们
but we do not touch them.

537
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,870
不可以碰安东尼
Antony must not be touched!

538
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,550
 把他们全杀了  不行
 Kill them all, I say.  None of that!

539
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,719
庞贝的命令
Pompey's strict orders.

540
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:15,408
谁找麻烦就会被钉死

让路！我说让开路！
Make a lane there! Make a lane there, I said!

00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,429
你有你想要的了，卡托
You have what you wanted, Cato.

549
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:38,149
凯撒没选择了
Caesar has no choice now.

550
00:40:38,209 --> 00:40:40,628
明年春天，他会翻过阿尔贝斯
Come the spring, he will cross the Alps

551
00:40:40,658 --> 00:40:44,887
带大军向罗马进发

552
00:40:53,915 --> 00:40:57,054
五个死了

马克·安东尼在你后面多远？

561
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,569
不到一小时
No more than an hour, sir.

562
00:41:25,238 --> 00:41:28,287
 集合！  是，长官！
 Sound assembly!  Sir!

563
00:41:28,757 --> 00:41:30,577
以议会的名义
By order of the Senate,

564
00:41:30,626 --> 00:41:32,916
盖乌斯·优利乌斯·恺撒
Gaius Julius Caesar

565
00:41:32,966 --> 00:41:35,885
成为罗马公敌

566
00:41:35,935 --> 00:41:37,345
所有公民
All good citizens are bound

567
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:40,904
有义务去杀掉他
to do him harm if they are able.

568
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,679
我来
I've got him.

569
00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:07,718
这么多年后，庞贝让我吃惊

570
00:42:08,558 --> 00:42:11,147
我曾想主动进攻

571
00:42:11,187 --> 00:42:14,516
但试图在议会谋杀
but to try and kill a Tribune?

572
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:16,636
护民官？
In the Forum?

573
00:42:17,056 --> 00:42:20,245
The man's found some hard black iron in his soul.

574
00:42:20,285 --> 00:42:24,234
我确定是你那精神错乱的卡托让他做的
I'm sure it was yon demented little worm Cato who put him up to it.

575
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:27,093
很好，对吗？
It's excellent, this.

576
00:42:27,263 --> 00:42:28,573
接下来？
So, what next?

我们看他还要说什么
Let's see what the men have to say.

578

别！
Oh, don't do that!

579
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,670
你看上去很好
You look just right as you are.

580
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:43,559
就像塞莫波莱的里昂纳达

581
00:42:44,509 --> 00:42:46,599
注意！

泰特斯·波罗

他们说我是战犯
They have declared that I am a criminal.

591
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,130
他们公布了，实际上

592
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:27,319
你们都是战犯！

不！
No!

594
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:32,658
护民官的否决权无效

595
00:43:32,698 --> 00:43:35,007
护民官马克·安东尼

596
00:43:35,047 --> 00:43:37,307
和13队的50人

597
00:43:37,347 --> 00:43:41,386
被1,000庞贝的杂种攻击

人民的护民官

被攻击！

602
00:43:54,613 --> 00:43:57,072
你们还能想到更严重的亵渎神灵吗？
Can you imagine a more terrible sacrilege?

603
00:43:57,112 --> 00:44:00,921
我们亲爱的共和国正被疯子操纵着

604
00:44:00,961 --> 00:44:03,081
现在是黑暗时期

605

我站在路中央

606
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,429
我可以向议会投降
I can abide the law and surrender my arms to the Senate

607
00:44:08,489 --> 00:44:10,219
眼睁睁的看着共和国灭亡
and watch the Republic fall

608
00:44:10,259 --> 00:44:12,059
在暴政和混乱中！

或者，我回罗马

卢比肯河，冷静

You're a rebel whether you like it or not.

他没选择

庞贝要杀马克·安东尼

643
00:46:50,671 --> 00:46:52,741

什么？ 你知道谁被攻击

645
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,629
什么意思？

646
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:02,139
现在没关系了
It doesn't matter now.

647

我们都死了

648
00:47:04,018 --> 00:47:07,577
这星期内我们就会被定在十字架上

653
00:47:22,844 --> 00:47:23,634

不可能
Caesar is in ltaly!

655
00:47:24,563 --> 00:47:28,713

1
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,475
怎么了，妈妈？
 What's wrong, Mother?   Ruined.

2
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:53,895
毁了！毁了！
Ruined!

3
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:55,935
那个白痴把我们全都毁了！
That idiot has ruined us all!

4
00:01:56,005 --> 00:01:57,875
我们将不得不离开罗马！
We shall have to leave Rome!

5
00:01:57,935 --> 00:02:00,275
恺撒已经渡过了卢比肯河
Caesar has crossed the Rubicon.

6
00:02:00,335 --> 00:02:02,835
他带着兵马踏上了意大利的土地
He's on ltalian soil under arms.

7
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:04,835
这可是叛国的行径
It's an act of gross treason.

8
00:02:04,905 --> 00:02:07,135
只带一个军团…如果你不介意的话
With a single legion, if you please.

9
00:02:07,205 --> 00:02:11,305
就不仅仅是叛国，而是自取灭亡的叛国之道
So not merely treason, but suicidal treason.

10
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:15,835
打完了吗，主人？
Will that be all, Domina?

11
00:02:17,575 --> 00:02:21,274
  你听说了吗？   嗯，很奇怪
  Have you heard?   Mmm. Strange.

12
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:23,104
做出如此蠢的一件事
Afoolishthingtodo.

13
00:02:23,174 --> 00:02:25,004
一个军团
One legion.

14
00:02:25,074 --> 00:02:27,834
我很想知道恺撒在想什么
I wonder what he's thinking.

15
00:02:27,904 --> 00:02:32,174
我不由得回想起当年我消灭那些伊利里亚人海盗的时候
I remember back when I destroyed the lllyrian pirates,

16
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:35,004
其中有个很特别的经验老道的…
there was one particular old sea snake

17
00:02:35,074 --> 00:02:36,774
小型三层桨战船，如果我没记错的话
a Liburnian, if I recall.

18
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:38,474
别说那些伊利里亚人海盗了
Never mind the lllyrian pirates.

19
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:40,304
我们该怎么办？
What is to be done?

20
00:02:40,374 --> 00:02:42,204
我已经发布命令了
I have already given word.

21
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:43,704
我的军团在集结
My legions are gathering.

22
00:02:43,774 --> 00:02:45,534
你会把恺撒他们给捻碎，对吧？
And you'll crush him, yeah?

23
00:02:45,604 --> 00:02:48,173
毫无疑问，那个可怜人死定了
Without question. The poor man is dead.

24
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:53,873
你将带领尤比恩骑兵，侦察
You are to take our Ubian cavalry and scout

25
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:56,803
由此到城市之间的路况以及防御的战略要点
all roads and defensive strongpoints between here and the city.

26
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,383
向前推进直到遇到抵抗
Advance until resistance is met.

27
00:02:58,403 --> 00:03:00,103
如果遇到了公民
If and when civilians are encountered,

28
00:03:00,143 --> 00:03:02,553
就把我们的这份布告递交给他们
deliver the enclosed proclamation.

29
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:06,633
如果没有遇到抵抗就直接把这份布告
If you encounter no resistance, go directly to the Forum

30
00:03:06,643 --> 00:03:09,893
钉到元老会论坛的门上
and nail it to the Senate door.

31
00:03:09,993 --> 00:03:10,793
长官
Sir.

32
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:14,273
不允许进行烧杀掠夺
There will be no rapine, pillage or burning.

33
00:03:14,832 --> 00:03:18,472
  有问题吗？   没有，长官
  Any questions?   None, sir.

34
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:20,182
执行命令吧
That will be all.

35
00:03:27,472 --> 00:03:30,272
你手下的这个乌瑞纳斯怎么这么闷？
What makes your man vorenus so morose?

36
00:03:30,342 --> 00:03:32,172
他只是对此有所抵触
He is stonewall Catonian.

37
00:03:32,242 --> 00:03:34,342
他认为我们犯了滔天大罪
He thinks we've committed a terrible crime,

38
00:03:34,402 --> 00:03:36,202
是逆天而行
a mighty sacrilege,

39
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:38,272
应该被神严厉的惩罚
and shall be severely punished by the Gods.

40
00:03:38,342 --> 00:03:40,972
  他没准是对的   只有我们失败了才有罪
  He may be right.   It's a crime if we lose.

41
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:42,971
而胜利者是无罪的
If we win, it isn't.

42
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,771
我不过是在要求我的合法权利，安东尼
I am merely pursuing my legitimate rights, Antony.

43
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:47,771
  当然   你认为我们可以信任他吗？
  Of course.   Do you think we can trust him?

44
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:49,901
  谁？   卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯
  Who?   Lucius vorenus.

45
00:03:49,971 --> 00:03:53,601
噢，他是老13军团的人了
Oh. Deep 13th, him.

46
00:03:53,671 --> 00:03:56,501
鹰旗就是他奋不顾身找回来的
He'd follow the eagle up Pluto's ass.

47
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,140
我跟你说过别来这里的
I told you not to come here.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,740
我很想看看我的儿子
I had to see my son.

49
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,200
你已经看到了，马上离开
You've seen him. Now go.

50
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,370
再也别回来了
And stay away.

51
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,019
帮帮我，内奥比
Help me, Niobe.

52
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,469
我都快要疯狂了
I'm going insane.

53
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,669
你不能就如此抛弃我
You can't forsake me.

54
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,185
我可以的
I do.

55
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:49,000
我不会放弃的
I won't give up. Don't think I will.

56
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,786
你爱过我一次，就会再次爱上我的
You loved me once, you will love me again.

57
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:54,559
我从来就没有爱上过你
I never loved you.

58
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:56,909
你可以试着欺骗自己，但不要欺骗我
Lie to yourself if you want, but don't lie to me.

59
00:04:56,969 --> 00:04:58,789
离开吧
Stay away.

60
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:01,029
你知道你将永远无法见到你的丈夫
You know you will never see your husband now,

61
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:02,669
你知道的，对吗？
you know that, eh?

62
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:04,769
他跟那些人都死定了
Him and all the rest of them are doomed.

63
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,869
你别那么肯定
You don't know that.

64
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,438
大家都知道会这样
Everybody knows that.

65
00:05:10,998 --> 00:05:13,098
或许会吧，但是我立过誓言（结婚时）
That may be, but I made a vow.

66
00:05:14,138 --> 00:05:15,598
离开
Go.

67
00:05:17,268 --> 00:05:18,898
离开
Go.

68
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,898
我向冥神发誓，如果你不离开
I swear to Dis, if you don't go

69
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:29,908
没什么事，他就走
It's all right. He's going.

70
00:05:29,968 --> 00:05:31,708
快离开吧
Just go.

71
00:05:34,308 --> 00:05:36,737
你答应过你不在见他
You promised you would never see him again.

72
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:38,887
我没叫他来，我让他走
I didn't want him here. I told him to go.

73
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:41,037
看起来可不像是这样
It didn't look like that.

74
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:46,607
你可以跟爸爸说出真相，不是你的错
You could tell Papa the truth. It's not your fault.

75
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,567
如果你跟我向他说…
If you and I spoke to him

76
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:50,927
永远不要，你发过誓的
Never. You have sworn.

77
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:53,617
你以为他战死了，爸爸会理解的
You thought he was dead. Papa will understand.

78
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:55,777
他会把我们全杀了
He will kill us all.

79
00:06:08,306 --> 00:06:13,136
你常说你是花丛中的老手
You   you often say that you are adept with women.

80
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,966
可不是闲谈时的自夸
No idle boast neither.

81
00:06:15,036 --> 00:06:18,266
从纳波到底比斯都有女孩子在晚上尖叫着我的名字
There are girls from Nabo to Thebes that scream my name by night.

82
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:20,266
我不需要你的床上技巧
I have no need of your coital expertise.

83
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:24,826
我问的是有关爱情的东西
My question more concerns their... affections.

84
00:06:24,876 --> 00:06:27,636
我可以在这方面给你一些指导
I'm your man for that to boot.

85
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:33,005
我老婆，她…
My wife, she...

86
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,560
你听到过她说，她恨我
You heard what she said, she hates me.

87
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:38,825
你到底想问什么？
What's your question?

88
00:06:38,855 --> 00:06:41,195
非常明显，我如何能够让她不恨我？
How do I stop her from hating me, obviously?

89
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:42,985
这可不是显而易见的问题
It's not obvious.

90
00:06:43,015 --> 00:06:45,005
我以为你特意的让她恨你呢
I thought you were making her hate you with a purpose.

91
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:47,135
那根本不是我的目的，我为什么要那么做？
That was not my intent at all. Why would I do that?

92
00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:49,475
我怎么知道，你是个聪明人
I don't know. You're the clever one, you.

93
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,475
你可能会有无数个理由这么作
There might have been 1,000 reasons.

94
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:53,975
我爱她，希望她也爱我，
I love her, and I require

95
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,314
而不是仅仅把我当成一个劳动力
that she love me also, else I am merely her slave.

96
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:58,795
对此我无法容忍
I cannot tolerate that.

97
00:07:00,494 --> 00:07:01,594
那么，是什么让你关心她怎么看待你
Well, what care you what she feels for you

98
00:07:01,614 --> 00:07:03,524
如果我们在这一两个礼拜内就会死掉
if we're all going to die this week or next?

99
00:07:03,554 --> 00:07:07,004
我们很可能会死掉，但是我死后谁来祭奠我的名字
And so we are, but who will honor my name when I am gone?

100
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:09,554
谁能为我向地狱女神跟冥王献上祭品？
Who will pay Proserpina and Pluto for my keep?

101
00:07:09,584 --> 00:07:12,074
谁会为我的墓碑撒上红酒？
Who will pour wine upon my grave?

102
00:07:12,614 --> 00:07:14,784
如果真的变成那样的话，我会做的
If it comes to that, I shall do the honors.

103
00:07:14,844 --> 00:07:17,044
这是最起码我可以做的
It's the least I could do.

104
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:18,734
谢谢
Thank you.

105
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:21,954
但是这不是一回事
But it's not the same thing.

106
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:23,654
此外…
Besides...

107
00:07:23,714 --> 00:07:26,274
你也会一起死掉的
you'll be dead too.

108
00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:36,443
我在计划今晚的一个小聚会，我需要你…
I'm planning on having a small party this evening and I'll need you to

109
00:07:38,193 --> 00:07:41,023
你用香水了？
Are you wearing perfume?

110
00:07:41,123 --> 00:07:43,353
一点点而已
Just a dab.

111
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:45,173
真是让人讨厌
It's horrid.

112
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:47,533
马粪味更适合你
Horseshit suits you much better.

113
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:50,043
现在我需要更多的人在外面守卫
Now I need you to get more men to stand guard outside

114
00:07:50,063 --> 00:07:52,213
当我的客人来得时候向他们问候
to greet my guests when they arrive.

115
00:07:52,213 --> 00:07:54,713
一个聚会？ 现在举行聚会是一个明智的举动吗？
A party? Is that wise, given how things are?

116
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:57,212
香水的建议？ 还想有点什么建议？
Perfume, advice   whatever next?

117
00:07:57,392 --> 00:08:00,362
我只想说庞贝的手下正蠢蠢欲动
I'm just saying Pompey's mob is out for blood.

118
00:08:00,402 --> 00:08:02,422
  最好低调点   低调？
  It's best to lay low.   Lay low?

119
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:05,162
我可不是一头蜥蜴，我永远不会被威胁
I'm not a lizard. I will not be intimidated.

120
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:07,992
如你所愿，不过价格高点
As you like. Cost you extra though.

121
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:11,012
你的报酬已经足够好了
You've been paid quite adequately already.

122
00:08:11,072 --> 00:08:13,512
更多的人手需要花费的更多
More men cost more.

123
00:08:15,652 --> 00:08:17,582
我会让卡斯特跟你谈的
I will tell Castor to speak with you.

124
00:08:17,612 --> 00:08:19,212
我并不是想要更多的钱
I don't want more money.

125
00:08:19,252 --> 00:08:21,232
那么，你想要什么呢？
Well, what do you want then?

126
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,711
你知道我想要什么
You know what I want.

127
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:29,451
就是像这样的…
Something like that.

128
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:32,941
  你忘记你的地位了   我的地位是来自于我的家族的
  You forget your place.   My place is with my family.

129
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:36,021
给个命令，我就会发动他们
Say the word, and I'll go to them.

130
00:08:40,901 --> 00:08:43,951
把你的事情做到我满意，然后…
Do your job to my satisfaction and...

131
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:48,621
我想你是会得到适当的回报的
I'll see that you're properly rewarded.

132
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:54,920
谢谢，主人
Thank you, Domina.

133
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,790
庞贝的先锋
Pompey's outriders.

134
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,580
他的军团应该也不远了
His legions won't be far behind.

135
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,760
我们跟剩下的13军团的弟兄们在市集日就会被钉在十字架上
Us and the rest of the 13th will be on crosses by market day.

136
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,460
感谢神，我父亲没有活着看见他的儿子以叛国者的身份而死去
Thank the Gods my father didn't live to see his son die a traitor.

137
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,339
最后现在就去死，嗯？ 走！
Best to die now then, eh? Go on.

138
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:23,679
等等，我们不是来交锋的
Wait! We're not here to fight.

139
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,649
“向前推进直到遇到抵抗”
"Advance until resistance is met."

140
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,639
这是我们的命令，也是我们所要做的
That is our orders. That is what we do.

141
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:29,729
为什么不呢？ 弟兄们都准备好了，对吧
Why not? The boys are ready, aren't you, boys?

142
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,109
让我们冲吧，来吧
Let's have a go. Come on!

143
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,019
不准交战！
No fight!

144
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:38,479
不！不准交战！该死的白痴们！
No! No fight now! Damned idiot!

145
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:44,149
列队防守
Form up and defend!

146
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,639
记住你们受过的训练！
Remember your training!

147
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:49,568
摆盾牌！
Shields!

148
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,608
  坚守阵地   站稳了
  Hold your ground!   Stand tall!

149
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:01,858
站稳了
Hold positions!

150
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,698
回来，懦夫

151
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:14,038
别动，懦夫，回来！
Stay in place, you cowards!

152
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:20,747
恺撒的斥候已到罗马城30英里外
Caesar's scouts are only 30 miles from Rome.

153
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:22,167
30英里？
30 miles?

154
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:24,827
他的推进速度很惊人
His speed is uncanny.

155
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:27,357
当然，他的人手不多
Of course, he has only a very few men,

156
00:10:27,387 --> 00:10:30,107
所以能够快速推进
which makes a fast pace easier.

157
00:10:30,347 --> 00:10:33,367
他领导的与其说是军队不如说是武装的暴徒
He is not leading an army so much as an armed gang.

158
00:10:33,387 --> 00:10:36,837
是非常无规矩，无道德的，甚至
It is all highly irregular, unethical even.

159
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:39,697
现在甚至都不是战争的季节
Gods, it is not even the war season.

160
00:10:39,697 --> 00:10:42,857
他没有想要直接攻击罗马吧？
Surely he does not think to attack Rome directly?

161
00:10:42,887 --> 00:10:44,527
我认为这正是他所想要做的
I think that is exactly what he will do.

162
00:10:44,557 --> 00:10:46,246
他怎么能够期待成功呢？
How can he hope to succeed?

163
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:48,196
目前的问题是
The problem is, at this moment,

164
00:10:48,226 --> 00:10:51,766
我们只有3个武装军团能够保卫这个城市
we have only three legions in arms for the defense of the city.

165
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:53,836
当然，3个军团已经足够了
Surely, three is more than enough.

166
00:10:53,876 --> 00:10:55,826
通常的情况下是的，但是大部分战士
Normally that would be true, but most of the men

167
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:58,766
都是新征召的，就像被斥候打散了的那些一样
are raw recruits like those who fled from the scouts.

168
00:10:58,796 --> 00:11:01,156
而剩下的都是打过高卢的老兵
The rest are veterans of Gaul.

169
00:11:01,216 --> 00:11:03,166
恺撒过去的手下不能信任
Caesar's men   not reliable.

170
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,526
罗马不设防了！
Rome is undefended!

171
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:09,186
我的军团正在尽快的集结
My legions are mustering as swiftly as possible,

172
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:12,626
但是需要最少4天时间
but it will take at least four days

173
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:16,775
才能成型并且保卫这个城市
to assemble a force capable of defending the city.

174
00:11:16,785 --> 00:11:20,395
恺撒的队伍只有不到2天的路程了
Caesar is two days away.

175
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,045
你真是一针见血
You touch it with a needle.

176
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:26,310
  我们现在怎么办？
What do we do now then?

177
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,211
我们必须进行一个战术撤退到南方
We must make a tactical retreat to the south.

178
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:29,755
一个战术撤退，提醒你们
A tactical retreat, mind you.

179
00:11:29,795 --> 00:11:31,045
离开这个城市？
Leave the city?

180
00:11:31,095 --> 00:11:33,025
朱诺神后的灰孙子，难道你疯了吗？
Juno's cunt! Do you run mad?

181
00:11:33,055 --> 00:11:34,455
你不能用这种语气跟我说话
You cannot speak to me in that tone.

182
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:36,935
朋友们，还是让我们集中关注手头的麻烦吧
My friends, let us cleave to the matter at hand.

183
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:39,715
除了撤退，没有别的路可以选了吗？
Is there no alternative to retreat then?

184
00:11:39,735 --> 00:11:42,754
没有，我们应该撤到迦非尼尔
None. We shall withdraw to Corfinium

185
00:11:42,784 --> 00:11:44,614
在那里重新集结我的军团
and rally my legions there.

186
00:11:44,654 --> 00:11:46,494
一旦他们集结起来，整顿好军序
Once they are gathered and in good order,

187
00:11:46,524 --> 00:11:49,234
我们就能轻松的把罗马城夺回来
we will simply retake the city.

188
00:11:49,274 --> 00:11:53,274
恺撒在春天前都无法得到援军
Caesar has no hope of reinforcement until spring.

189
00:11:53,294 --> 00:11:56,054
意大利的城市都会对他关上大门
The towns of ltaly will close their gates to him.

190
00:11:56,084 --> 00:12:00,654
在人力跟物力资源上我们已经立于不败之地
We will have an unassailable advantage in men and resources.

191
00:12:00,694 --> 00:12:04,524
那么事实上，这根本不是个令人羞辱的溃退
So in fact, this is not a humiliating defeat at all

192
00:12:04,554 --> 00:12:06,684
而是个罕有的胜利？
but a rare species of victory?

193
00:12:06,714 --> 00:12:09,844
卡托，让你自己冷静下来，你对军事上的东西一无所知
Calm yourself, Cato. You lack understanding of things military,

194
00:12:09,844 --> 00:12:11,733
你将会看到，我的战术
else you would see that my actions

195
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,891
将是无比完美的在任何时候
have been perfectly correct at all times.

196
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:17,873
你毫不抵抗的就放弃罗马
You have lost Rome without unsheathing your sword.

197
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,223
你已经失去罗马了！
You have lost Rome!

198
00:12:34,773 --> 00:12:37,023
庞贝的手下的那些杂碎在我们的门外
Pompeian scum at our very door!

199
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:38,772
真让人无法忍受
It's intolerable.

200
00:12:38,812 --> 00:12:41,712
如果泰门跟他的手下不在这里的话，他们会把房子都烧了
If Timon and his men weren't here, they'd be burning down the house.

201
00:12:41,742 --> 00:12:43,232
哦，他们没有那么多精神
Oh, they are not that energetic.

202
00:12:43,252 --> 00:12:46,672
这场自杀式的谋反使所有人都变得跟我们敌对起来
This suicidal rebellion has turned everyone against us.

203
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:49,052
我发誓，如果恺撒现在就在这里的话
I swear, if Caesar were here now,

204
00:12:49,112 --> 00:12:51,192
我会狠狠的刺向他的脖子
I would stab him in the neck.

205
00:12:51,232 --> 00:12:53,702
  他把我们都给毁了   对此我不是很确定
  He has ruined us.   I'm not so sure of that.

206
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:56,302
但是我想庞贝的地位也不稳固了
But I think Pompey's position is deceptively weak.

207
00:12:56,332 --> 00:12:59,502
想，想，想，这就是全部你做的事情，你这个笨小孩
Think think think   that's all you do, you silly boy.

208
00:12:59,522 --> 00:13:01,822
我们所以的朋友都抛弃了我们
All our friends have abandoned us,

209
00:13:01,852 --> 00:13:05,092
那帮胆小鬼，我们优利亚家族现在人见人恶了
cowards that they are. We Julii are lepers now.

210
00:13:05,122 --> 00:13:09,601
别太夸张了，不是你所有的朋友都抛弃了你
Let us not exaggerate, not all of your friends have deserted you.

211
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:11,881
这是会被记住的
Andthatwill be remembered.

212
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:13,241
你是我们忠诚的好友
You are good loyal people.

213
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:15,831
虽然放弃恺撒非常有诱惑力
It's very tempting to abandon Caesar,

214
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:19,091
但是如果现在这么做的话，那我们就会被看成
but to do so now, well, that would look like we're mere...

215
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:21,041
顺应大潮流的奴隶
slaves to fashion.

216
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:27,901
你们留下来保护房子
You're staying to protect the house

217
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:31,061
但是想都别想我跟你们的主人无法回来
but don't think for a moment that your master and I will not return.

218
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:33,341
我们最晚下月初就回来
We will be back by the Calends at the latest.

219
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:34,871
当我回来的时候
And when I do return, those of you I find

220
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,750
如果我发现你们当中有人没有尽好自己的责任的话，他就会付出生命的代价
have not done their utmost duty will pay with their lives.

221
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,980
将军，你的卫队已经准备完毕
General, your escort is ready.

222
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,590
格涅乌斯
  Gnaeus.   Mmm?

223
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,970
多里奥，卫队准备好了吗？
Durio, is the escort ready?

224
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,210
  准备好了，长官   那么出发吧
  Ready, sir.   Away then.

225
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,960
丈夫，国库呢？
Husband, the treasury?

226
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,520
哦，对啊
Yes, of course.

227
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,269
多里奥，你必须
Durio. You must secure

228
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,899
确保国库黄金的安全
as much of the treasury gold as possible.

229
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:06,679
分遣队走，打开卡比托奈山丘神殿拱顶
Take a detachment and open up the Capitoline vaults.

230
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:09,799
时间不多了，尽你所能吧
There's not much time, so do what you can.

231
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:22,049
让我们装作是奥德修斯跟他的朋友
Let's pretend we're Odysseus and his friends,

232
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,669
偷偷摸摸的溜出独眼巨人的洞穴
creeping out of the Cyclops' cave.

233
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:28,139
我们必须像老鼠一样安静，好吗？
We must be quiet as little mice, all right?

234
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,630
Come.

235
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:39,328
  对这一切我很抱歉   别这么说
  Sorry about all this.   Do not say so.

236
00:14:39,368 --> 00:14:41,268
我不介意一点小小的刺激
I don't mind a little excitement.

237
00:14:41,318 --> 00:14:44,868
一切都会好的，我向你保证
All will be well, I assure you.

238
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:46,678
我对此毫不怀疑
I have no doubt.

239
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:56,238
出发
Let's away.

240
00:14:56,258 --> 00:15:00,077
记住，别搞出声音
And remember,, nosound.

241
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:06,317
打开它！
Break it down!

242
00:15:07,427 --> 00:15:09,017
真是仁慈
Here's a mercy.

243
00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:12,437
为了不让我们活在羞愧和不荣誉中
Instead of living out our lives in shame and disgrace,

244
00:15:12,457 --> 00:15:13,877
一群疯狂的暴徒要强奸，殴打我们
we are to be raped and beaten

245
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:16,577
要把我们撕成碎片
and torn limb from limb by a raving mob.

246
00:15:19,817 --> 00:15:22,637
这些畜生我想不会放过你们的
These brutes will not let you pass, I think.

247
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,237
你晚上可以留下，如果你想的话
You may stay the night if you want.

248
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:28,756
谢谢，我们对此很高兴
We would be delighted, thank you.

249
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:28,374
等等，走错了
Wait wait. Wrong way.

250
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,554
亚壁门在右边
The Appian gate is to the right.

251
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:32,454
我们不去亚壁
We're not going to the Appian.

252
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:34,054
什么？
What?

253
00:16:48,694 --> 00:16:51,594
当然，你取悦女人最好的方法是
Of course, your best method for pleasing a woman

254
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:53,793
敌人温暖且还在跳动的心脏
is the warm, beating heart of an enemy.

255
00:16:53,823 --> 00:16:56,063
女人们会说她们不喜欢，其实是喜欢的
Women will say they don't like it, but they do.

256
00:16:56,093 --> 00:16:57,513
会让她们像雨季那样潮湿
It makes them wet as October.

257
00:16:57,563 --> 00:16:59,183
这解决不了问题
That doesn't answer.

258
00:16:59,403 --> 00:17:01,933
那么试试这个，跟她谈谈
Well, failing that, talk to her.

259
00:17:02,513 --> 00:17:04,153
谈谈
Talk.

260
00:17:04,243 --> 00:17:06,473
  说什么？   说什么无关紧要
  But of what?   That doesn't matter.

261
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:08,903
关键在于你的声调嗓音
It's all about the tone of the voice.

262
00:17:09,043 --> 00:17:11,903
你应该就像给一匹烈马上马鞍一样
You pretend like you're putting a saddle on a skittish horse.

263
00:17:11,943 --> 00:17:14,193
“这儿宝贝，嘘，来吧”
"There, honey. Shh, come now."

264
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,023
你知道的，就像这样
You know, that sort of thing.

265
00:17:16,063 --> 00:17:19,083
  就这些？   还有什么？
  That's all?   What else?

266
00:17:19,203 --> 00:17:22,672
噢！任何时候都跟她说她很漂亮
Oh! Tell her she is beautiful all the time.

267
00:17:22,702 --> 00:17:25,302
每次你见到她的时候都跟她说她很漂亮
Tell her she's beautiful every time you see her,

268
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:27,132
即使她不是
even when she's not.

269
00:17:27,382 --> 00:17:29,212
还有什么？
And what else?

270
00:17:29,432 --> 00:17:33,592
噢！还有，非常重要的是…
Oh! Also, very important...

271
00:17:34,062 --> 00:17:37,882
当您们行周公之礼的时候，她小妹妹上方有个地方
when you couple with her, there's a spot just above her cunny

272
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:38,982
就像个小纽扣
it's like a little button.

273
00:17:39,022 --> 00:17:41,522
注意要关注到那里
Now, attend to that button,

274
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:44,272
那么她就会很享受的
and she will open up like a flower.

275
00:17:44,302 --> 00:17:46,452
你怎么知道她那里的？
How do you know this of her?

276
00:17:47,552 --> 00:17:49,631
所以的女人都有
All women havethem.

277
00:17:49,671 --> 00:17:51,831
随便问一个就知道了
Ask anyone.

278
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,805
Ho ho ho, very pretty. Come up behind!

279
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,039
  Come with us!   Sit up here!

280
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,071
You can make me happy!

281
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,208
It'll make me happy.

282
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:11,631
哦，哦哦，小美丽，跟上来
Here you go. Up you go. Come on!

283
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,340
我会杀掉奥克塔维娅，然后玛如拉来做了我
I will kill Octavia, and Merula tends to me,

284
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,520
但是如果她做不到，我被活抓了，那么你必须要杀了我
but if she cannot, and I am taken alive, then you must kill me.

285
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,610
然后你必须自杀
And then you must kill yourself.

286
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,430
你活下去将是不恰当的
Your survival would be inappropriate.

287
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,270
我不会想着活下去的，主人
I would not think of living, Domina.

288
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,230
屋大维，你喜欢谁杀你？
Octavian, who would you prefer kills you?

289
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,910
我已经大的能够照顾自己了
I am old enough to take care of myself.

290
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,799
噢，我勇敢的小男人
Oh, that's my brave little man.

291
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:47,349
赛维莉娅…
Servilia...

292
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:50,109
我的人能够给你任何协助吗？
can my people be of any assistance to you?

293
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:52,619
谢谢，但是我相信我们能够自我解决
Thank you but I'm sure we can manage by ourselves somehow.

294
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:53,779
很好
very well.

295
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:56,319
母亲，我倾向不是你来杀我
Mother, I would rather it were not you killed me

296
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,919
如果你没有异议的话
if you have no objection.

297
00:18:57,949 --> 00:19:00,459
为什么不，你不会还在生我的气吧
Why ever not? You can't still be angry with me.

298
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:02,399
  是个命令吗？   仁慈的女神啊！
  Is that an order?   Bona Dea!

299
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:03,979
我感觉你从来没有听过我说
I feel like you have never listened

300
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:07,109
冥府守门狗正在向我们嚎叫，你还在用你那些无稽
Cerberus is howling for us, and still you plague me

301
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:08,769
感觉来烦我？
with your ridiculous feelings?

302
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,779
如果你让我跟格雷毕斯再婚
If you had only let Glabius and I remarry

303
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:12,649
噢，什么都是格雷毕斯！
Oh, always Glabius!

304
00:19:12,689 --> 00:19:15,688
我唾骂格雷毕斯！我撒尿在那个可怜虫身上！
I spit on Glabius! I piss on the wretch!

305
00:19:15,728 --> 00:19:17,878
哦，没错，母亲，就像你活着那样死去
Oh, that's right, Mother, die as you have lived

306
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:19,778
  灵魂中满是恶毒   都听着！
  poison brimming in your soul.   Listen!

307
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:24,060
我不会跟你吵，卡斯特要确认割断奥克塔维娅的喉咙
I'll not argue with you. Castor, be sure to cut Octavia's throat

308
00:19:24,068 --> 00:19:25,938
在你割断我的喉咙之前    卡斯特请让我母亲来做
before you cut mine.   Please, Castor, let Mother do it.

309
00:19:25,968 --> 00:19:27,738
我不想回绝她最后一件乐事
I won't deny her one last pleasure.

310
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:31,068
  就不像个女儿了   都听着！
  It would be undaughterly.   Listen!

311
00:20:08,237 --> 00:20:13,016
执政官格涅乌斯·庞贝·麦格纳斯已经离开这个城市了
Consul Gnaeus Pompey Magnus has left the city.

312
00:20:13,036 --> 00:20:18,336
他命令所有贵族跟武士们也这么做
He commands all noblemen and knights to do likewise.

313
00:20:18,356 --> 00:20:21,136
留下来的人会被认为是
Those that remain will be considered

314
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,016
  罗马帝国的敌人   懦夫！
  enemies of Rome.   Cowards!

315
00:20:47,085 --> 00:20:48,795
你听说了
You heard, then.

316
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:50,785
真不知道那会带来什么好处
Don't know what good that will do.

317
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,105
任何人想进来，他们就能够进来
Anyone wants to get in, they'll get in.

318
00:20:53,145 --> 00:20:54,735
搭把手，好吗？
Give us a hand, will you?

319
00:20:57,195 --> 00:20:59,375
看起来，你男人总归会回来
So your man will be back after all, looks like.

320
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:00,825
看起来是
It looks like.

321
00:21:02,215 --> 00:21:03,715
你似乎对此不是很高兴
You don't sound too happy about it.

322
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:07,144
  我当然很高兴，他是我丈夫   如果你这么说的话
  Of course I'm happy. He's my husband.   If you say so.

323
00:21:10,244 --> 00:21:12,024
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

324
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:13,824
我只是说说而已
I was just talking.

325
00:21:13,924 --> 00:21:15,664
我说的太多了
I talk too much.

326
00:21:16,564 --> 00:21:18,584
我不知道，莉萨
I don't know, Rissa.

327
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:22,694
我尽最大可能去爱他，我确实是
I try my best to love him, I do.

328
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:28,054
我不知道我是否希望他回来
I don't know whether I want him to come back.

329
00:21:30,104 --> 00:21:32,984
我不会相信如果我没有亲眼见到
I would not credit it if I had not seen it myself.

330
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:36,753
庞贝的人放弃了这个城市，放弃了罗马
Pompey's men deserting the city, deserting Rome,

331
00:21:36,783 --> 00:21:38,813
一半的元老都上马跑了
half the Senate ahorse.

332
00:21:38,843 --> 00:21:40,393
毫无疑问一个滑稽的场面
A comical sight no doubt.

333
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:41,793
神们啊
Gods.

334
00:21:42,753 --> 00:21:47,923
我们处于一个该死的尴尬局面
We are in a damned awkward position.

335
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:49,493
如果我们留下…
If we stay...

336
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:53,263
我们就是拥护恺撒，拥护叛军
we are declaring for Caesar, for rebellion.

337
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:57,433
如果我们离开，我们…我们就是追随庞贝以及元老院
And if we go, we   we are with Pompey and the Senate.

338
00:21:57,433 --> 00:22:00,433
  没有可以妥协的余地   那么你的决定是什么？
  There is no middle ground.   So what is the answer?

339
00:22:00,473 --> 00:22:04,472
恺撒是我们最亲爱的朋友，但是他正在做的是…
Caesar is our dearest friend, but what he is doing is

340
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:09,692
我不知道
I do not know.

341
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:13,092
你必须决定
You must decide.

342
00:22:23,182 --> 00:22:24,242
那么就是庞贝
Pompey then.

343
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:25,832
我们必须跟庞贝走
We must go with Pompey.

344
00:22:25,862 --> 00:22:28,602
共和比任何朋友都重要
The Republic is more important than any friendship.

345
00:22:28,632 --> 00:22:31,751
  你同意吗？   那是你的决定
  Do you agree?   It's your decision.

346
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:32,991
那么就是庞贝
Pompey then.

347
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,701
那么就是庞贝
Pompey then.

348
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:37,191
我们没有时间可以浪费了
We have no time to lose.

349
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:40,561
告诉你的侍女们准备离开，越快越好
Tell your women to be ready to leave as soon as possible.

350
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,111
我不走
I'm not leaving.

351
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,021
你是什么意思？
What do you mean?

352
00:22:45,051 --> 00:22:48,131
我等恺撒等了8年
I've waited eight years for Caesar.

353
00:22:48,221 --> 00:22:49,621
我现在不能离开
I cannot leave now.

354
00:22:49,651 --> 00:22:51,951
如果我要走，你不能留下
You cannot stay, not if I go.

355
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:54,251
我当然可以留下
Of course I can stay.

356
00:22:54,301 --> 00:22:55,551
我可做我想做的事
I can do as I wish.

357
00:22:55,581 --> 00:22:59,450
目前，留下来的都是罗马的敌人
Mother, all who stay are enemies of Rome.

358
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,000
  庞贝已经这么宣布了   恺撒有可能会胜利
  Pompey has declared it.   Caesar might prevail.

359
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:05,660
是的，他可能统治罗马1个礼拜1个月，甚至1年
Yes, he might rule Rome for a week, a month, a year even,

360
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,750
但是另外一些有野心的人就会
but then some other ambitious man

361
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,650
杀了他，取代他的位置
will kill him and take his place,

362
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,460
那时你就是暴君的情妇
and you then will be the mistress of a dead tyrant.

363
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,930
母亲，我们知道什么会发生在她们身上
Mother, we know what happens to them.

364
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,510
这还是让神们来决定吧
That is for the gods decide.

365
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,730
我无法自拔的爱着他
I cannot help loving him.

366
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,380
够了，母亲！
A va, Mother!

367
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,640
你…你是彻底被你的欲望所蒙蔽了
You   you are blinded by untapped lust.

368
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,110
我会在市集上帮你买个又好又大的昔勒尼人，然后解决问题
I'll get you a good big Cyrenian at the market and have done with it.

369
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:32,489
你最好走吧
You'd better go.

370
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:36,299
别生我的气
Don't be angry with me.

371
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:40,219
我们可能要分离很长时间
We may be parted for a long time.

372
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:43,679
来
Come.

373
00:24:04,008 --> 00:24:05,408
再见，母亲
Goodbye, Mother.

374
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,778
再见，我的宝贝
Goodbye, my love.

375
00:24:26,607 --> 00:24:29,047
你的女儿离开了
Your daughter left.

376
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:30,757
什么时候？
When?

377
00:24:30,797 --> 00:24:33,457
刚刚，我找人跟着她了
Just now. I put a boy to following her.

378
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:36,517
我会中止这个没意义的事情的
I'll put a stop to this nonsense.

379
00:24:43,237 --> 00:24:45,867
  派你的人   什么？
  Fetch your men.   What?

380
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,737
现在
Now.

381
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,266
为什么你还没有离开城里
Why have you not left the city?

382
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,226
 现在不安全
I could not leave without seeing you.

383
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,218
大家都知道现在你们跟着庞贝
It's not safe for you. Everyone knows you're with Pompey.

384
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:11,166
别着急，我在日出前就走
Don't fret. I'll be gone by sunrise.

385
00:25:52,714 --> 00:25:55,124
  这是我所有的钱   谢谢
  That's all I have.   Thank you,

386
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:58,004
不过我们不是打劫
but this is not a robbery.

387
00:26:01,064 --> 00:26:03,474
  阿提娅   我会给你点时间
  Atia.   I'll give you a moment,

388
00:26:03,514 --> 00:26:06,404
如果你想跟神祷告的话
if there are gods you'd like to speak to.

389
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:10,104
一个请求…放过我的手下
One favor   let my men live.

390
00:26:10,144 --> 00:26:13,334
对不起，上头有命令
Sorry. It's orders.

391
00:26:14,624 --> 00:26:17,123
把你的剑给我
Give me your sword.

392
00:26:51,182 --> 00:26:54,262
那些星星都是什么？
What are they, the stars?

393
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:58,172
星星？ 天球上的洞而已
Stars? Holes in the celestial spheres.

394
00:26:58,222 --> 00:27:01,852
天堂的光通过那些洞照射进来
Holes through which the light of the heavens shine.

395
00:27:01,892 --> 00:27:03,272
那些洞有多大？
How big are these holes?

396
00:27:03,312 --> 00:27:05,002
非常大
They're big.

397
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:08,772
之所以看起来这么小，是因为他们离我们好几百英里远
They only seem small to us because they're hundreds of miles away.

398
00:27:08,802 --> 00:27:11,162
大的足够让男人通过？
Big enough for a man to climb through?

399
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,772
我猜是
I suppose.

400
00:27:14,021 --> 00:27:16,681
但首先人是无法到达那里的
But man would never be able to get up there in the first place.

401
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:19,241
  我看不出为什么不行   怎么去呢？
  I don't see why not.   How?

402
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:22,891
他可以抓住一只巨鸟
He could hold onto a giant bird.

403
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,421
像那样是不行的
It doesn't work like that.

404
00:27:28,471 --> 00:27:31,331
  为什么不行？   这是哲学的东西
  Why not?   It's philosophy.

405
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:33,841
很难解释的
It's hard to explain.

406
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,450
是吗，纽摩，那真是不必要的
Really, Numa, that's quite unnecessary.

407
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,360
我请求你站起来
I beg you stand.

408
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,860
这里不需要太拘谨
There shall be no formality here,

409
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,710
不是在像我们这样的老朋友之间
not between old friends like us.

410
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,700
千倍的感激，阿提娅
Athousand gratitudes, Atia.

411
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,770
我们卑谦的寻求您家族的保护以及友谊
We humbly seek the protection and friendship of your family.

412
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,560
不幸的是，有人说
Sadly, there are some people who say

413
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,130
我是庞贝那一派的人
that I am of the Pompeian faction.

414
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,380
你不是吗？
Are you not?

415
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,710
所有庞贝的党羽早已逃走了
All of Pompey's faction have long since fled.

416
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,439
你只是因为害怕你的工厂跟仓库被抢劫才留下来的吧
You stay for fear your factories and storehouses will be looted.

417
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:12,129
我向你保证，不是那样的
I assure you, that's not true

418
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:13,849
卡斯特
Castor.

419
00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:20,159
  5,000 便士   那么多？
  5,000 denarii.   That much?

420
00:28:20,219 --> 00:28:22,499
  我，我…   请不要让我们变得那么低俗
  l l     Please, let us not be vulgar.

421
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:25,479
我会立刻安排的
I'll make the arrangements immediately.

422
00:28:44,128 --> 00:28:45,938
你的那个手下多里奥在哪里？
Where is your man Durio?

423
00:28:45,978 --> 00:28:47,628
他迟到了很久了
He is long overdue now.

424
00:28:47,658 --> 00:28:49,918
多里奥是我最优秀的手下
Durio is the best man I have.

425
00:28:49,968 --> 00:28:51,608
他不会出错的
He won't fail.

426
00:28:51,638 --> 00:28:53,138
但如果有问题，那么怎么办？
But if not, what then?

427
00:28:53,178 --> 00:28:55,868
我们怎么给军团发饷，怎么喂饱他们？
How do we pay the legions? How do we feed them?

428
00:28:55,908 --> 00:28:59,408
我还没有那种想法，卡托，你像女人一样烦人
I have not the least idea. You fret like a woman, Cato.

429
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:04,348
多里奥会带着足够多的黄金来维持我们的军团
Durio will return with more than enough gold to feed and pay the legions.

430
00:29:04,388 --> 00:29:07,427
不论怎样，我们会在春天前回到罗马
By any road we'll be back in Rome before spring,

431
00:29:07,467 --> 00:29:09,687
别担心了
so stop worrying.

432
00:29:18,937 --> 00:29:20,377
真是莫名其妙
It makes no sense.

433
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:21,577
现在我们应该被阻止了
We should have been stopped by now.

434
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:23,687
为什么罗马没有防御？
Why is Rome not defended?

435
00:29:23,717 --> 00:29:25,657
我们的弟兄们把他们吓跑了，嗯？
Our boys scared 'em off, eh?

436
00:29:25,707 --> 00:29:27,637
共和国的战士是不会跑的
Soldiers of the Republic do not run,

437
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:31,727
  所以肯定是个战略或者计谋   那么肯定是个好计谋
  so it must be a stratagem or trick.   Then it's a good trick.

438
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:34,536
除非神们已经放弃了罗马
Unless the gods have abandoned Rome.

439
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:36,116
如果战神在关注
If Mars was watching,

440
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,116
他不会允许如此不荣誉的事情发生的
he would not allow such a disgrace.

441
00:29:38,156 --> 00:29:39,916
有可能他在忙着掷骰子而没有注意到这里
Well, maybe he was having a crap and missed it.

442
00:29:39,936 --> 00:29:44,186
那种无礼已经引导我们到达这个糟糕的困境
It's that sort of disrespect that has led us to this sad pass.

443
00:29:44,226 --> 00:29:48,266
如果神们不被尊敬，他们为什么要帮助我们？
If the gods are not respected, then why should they help us?

444
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,246
还是没有部队
Still no troops.

445
00:29:54,446 --> 00:29:56,016
我期待他们会从侧翼袭击我们
They will have flanked us, I expect.

446
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:58,566
或许那些赶牛车的人知道点什么
Perhaps these drovers know something.

447
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,237
Whoa.

448
00:30:12,285 --> 00:30:14,535
  神圣的公民们   队长
  Salve, citizens.   Captain.

449
00:30:14,575 --> 00:30:16,735
  你们从城里来？   是的
  You come from the city?   We do.

450
00:30:16,785 --> 00:30:19,595
  那里现在怎样？   你们是恺撒的手下
  How goes it there?   You're Caesar's men.

451
00:30:19,645 --> 00:30:22,145
  是的   财富女神已经为你们布满了金蛋
  We are.   Fortune spreads her legs for you.

452
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,755
庞贝已经逃了，城是你们的了
Pompey has fled. The city is yours.

453
00:30:24,795 --> 00:30:28,245
  庞贝为什么逃走？   对他来说你们太快了
  Why would Pompey flee?   You boys were too fast for him.

454
00:30:28,275 --> 00:30:30,225
他没有足够的时间招集他的军队
He couldn't raise his armies quick enough.

455
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,984
他跟他的手下撤向南方，元老院也跟去了
Him and his men are retreating south, and the Senate with 'em.

456
00:30:33,024 --> 00:30:34,914
看吧？ 错了一次
See? Wrong for once.

457
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:36,994
那么，嗯，享受你们的胜利吧
Well, uh, enjoy your victory boys.

458
00:30:37,034 --> 00:30:40,074
  那个女孩值多少钱？   不卖
  How much do you want for the girl?   Not for sale.

459
00:30:40,144 --> 00:30:42,024
货车里是什么？
What's in the wagon?

460
00:30:43,184 --> 00:30:44,924
  谷物   让我们看看，士兵
  Grain.   Show us, soldier.

461
00:30:44,974 --> 00:30:46,204
  这里没有士兵
There's no soldiers here.

462
00:30:46,224 --> 00:30:48,454
我的错，你们全部穿着士兵的鞋子
My mistake. You all wear the soldier's boot,

463
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,307
所以我假设你们是士兵，但是我错了
so I assumed you are soldiers, but I'm wrong.

464
00:30:50,384 --> 00:30:53,664
但是为什么会有9个士兵看着一辆装着谷物的货车？
But why would nine good soldiers be guarding a grain wagon?

465
00:30:53,684 --> 00:30:55,954
我不需要给你看什么
I don't have to show you nothing.

466
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,367
Hyah!

467
00:31:47,082 --> 00:31:50,422
我永远的忠诚，主人
My fidelity always, Domina.

468
00:31:51,762 --> 00:31:53,862
我不喜欢去怀疑你，庞帝拉丝
I do not like to doubt you, Proculus,

469
00:31:53,892 --> 00:31:57,571
但是我上一次在早晨的召集中看见你已经是年前的事了
but it's an age since I have seen you at my morning levy.

470
00:31:57,601 --> 00:31:59,931
或许你是不太舒服，大脖子病是吗？
Perhaps you have been unwell. Goiters is it?

471
00:31:59,971 --> 00:32:02,621
啊，嗯…如您所说，大脖子病
Ah, uh   goiters, as you say.

472
00:32:02,661 --> 00:32:05,191
又胖又贪婪的男人经常会发现这个
Fat, greedy men often find it so.

473
00:32:06,381 --> 00:32:09,551
我应该杀一只猫头鹰好让你的健康继续
I shall kill an owl that your good health continue.

474
00:32:18,941 --> 00:32:21,301
说明白点，你个奴才
Speak sense, you creature.

475
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,850
这是什么可怕的交易啊，把尸体运到人家的大门
What vile trade is this, bringing corpses to honest doors?!

476
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,730
把它带走
Take it away!

477
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,410
看看你们都做了什么？
See what you have done?

478
00:33:02,459 --> 00:33:03,879
这城市是不设防的
The city's unguarded.

479
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,429
是真的，共和国正在沦陷
It's true then. The Republic is fallen.

480
00:33:06,469 --> 00:33:09,039
但是天还是在上，地还是在下
Yet the sky is still above us, and the earth still below.

481
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:10,469
  真是奇怪   众神一点都不急
  Strange.   The gods are in no hurry.

482
00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:12,669
他们会花费时间慢慢的折磨我们
They will take their time in tormenting us.

483
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,839
让我们回去看看货车里有什么，顺便解开那个女孩
Let's go back and see what's in that wagon. Untie that girl.

484
00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:16,789
不是我们关心的，我们要执行命令
Not our concern. We follow orders.

485
00:33:16,819 --> 00:33:18,749
向前推进直到遇到抵抗
Advance until resistance is met.

486
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:22,118
  但是那个可怜的女孩…   你要履行你的义务
  But that poor girl     You will do your duty.

487
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:24,278
你真是个刻薄的混蛋，那就是你的问题
You are a mean bastard, that's your problem.

488
00:33:24,328 --> 00:33:26,118
你不会得到爱
You've no love in you.

489
00:33:26,168 --> 00:33:29,068
你可以向内奥比甜言蜜语，但是不会有任何作用
You can talk sweet as you like to Niobe, it won't do you any good.

490
00:33:29,098 --> 00:33:31,548
她一个字都不会相信的
She won't believe a word.

491
00:33:35,948 --> 00:33:38,268
宝贝，你终于醒了
Ercule, you wake at last.

492
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,098
我很担心
I was worried.

493
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:41,908
来点水？
Water?

494
00:33:44,488 --> 00:33:46,798
我可怜的宝贝
My poor baby.

495
00:33:46,848 --> 00:33:49,467
哦，那一切都不是梦啊
Oh, it was not a dream then.

496
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:52,767
格雷毕斯死了
Glabius is dead.

497
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:55,567
他死了
He is.

498
00:33:56,307 --> 00:33:58,617
我很难过
I'm sorry.

499
00:34:09,627 --> 00:34:11,907
你为什么那样看着我？
Why do you look at me like that?

500
00:34:11,987 --> 00:34:13,887
怎样？
Like what?

501
00:34:13,947 --> 00:34:15,497
好像是我…
As ifl

502
00:34:15,537 --> 00:34:18,596
  是你吗？   你怎么能够问我这个问题？
  Did you?   How can you ask me that question?

503
00:34:18,636 --> 00:34:20,536
是你吗？
Did you?

504
00:34:22,656 --> 00:34:25,026
我才没有！
I did not!

505
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:26,506
而且我很痛苦因为你居然有
And I'm tortured that you would harbor

506
00:34:26,546 --> 00:34:30,276
  那种可怕的想法   看着我！
  such a horrible notion.   Look at me!

507
00:34:36,376 --> 00:34:42,366
女儿，我以所有祖先的面目发誓
Daughter, I swear on the masks of all my ancestors

508
00:34:42,406 --> 00:34:43,896
我什么都没做…
that I had nothing

509
00:34:43,946 --> 00:34:47,215
我跟格雷毕斯的死毫无关系
nothing to do with the killing of Glabius.

510
00:34:49,825 --> 00:34:52,405
母亲，你认为是谁做的呢？
Who do you think did it, Mother?

511
00:34:53,815 --> 00:34:55,265
街上到处是尸体
The streets are full of corpses.

512
00:34:55,305 --> 00:34:57,935
任何人都有可能
It could have been anyone.

513
00:35:29,264 --> 00:35:32,294
“本诏告来自于盖乌斯·优利乌斯·恺撒
"These are the words of Gaius Julius Caesar,

514
00:35:32,324 --> 00:35:36,574
维纳斯的直系子孙，高卢总督
direct descendant of venus, Proconsul of Gaul,

515
00:35:36,574 --> 00:35:39,684
显赫的北方军团统帅
Glorious lmperato of the northern legions.

516
00:35:39,724 --> 00:35:41,853
公民们，我已经回到意大利
Citizens, I have returned to ltaly

517
00:35:41,893 --> 00:35:45,933
我的目的仅仅是为自己讨回合法的，道德的权利
with the sole intention of claiming my legal and moral rights.

518
00:35:45,963 --> 00:35:49,113
我并不渴求非法的权力
I have no desire for unlawful powers.

519
00:35:49,143 --> 00:35:50,933
我不会宣布任何人为敌
I will name no man an enemy

520
00:35:50,973 --> 00:35:53,433
既便他们这么做了
who does not so declare himself.

521
00:35:53,483 --> 00:35:57,533
经管如此，这些敌人的财产也不会被谋夺
Even so, the property of those enemies will not be appropriated

522
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:59,773
他们的家人也不会被涉及
and their person will remain inviolate

523
00:35:59,803 --> 00:36:02,423
只要他们的反对能够是和平进行的
as long as their opposition be peaceful.

524
00:36:02,463 --> 00:36:05,463
此外，对于任何拿起武器反对我的人
Moreover, to any man that has taken arms against me

525
00:36:05,493 --> 00:36:09,792
只要现在感到后悔，我很乐于特赦他们
and now regrets it, I gladly offer total amnesty.

526
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,982
但是，那些继续使用暴力
However, those that continue to use violence

527
00:36:12,032 --> 00:36:14,162
来反对我合法权利的人
to oppose my legal rights,

528
00:36:14,202 --> 00:36:17,322
他们会得到他们应受的惩罚
they shall receive that which they seek to give.

529
00:36:17,362 --> 00:36:20,152
在朱庇特主神的保护下
Under the auspices of Jupiter Capitolinus,

530
00:36:20,192 --> 00:36:24,202
这就是盖乌斯·优利乌斯·恺撒的诏告”
these are the words of Gaius Julius Caesar."

531
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,022
你在干吗？
What are you doing?

532
00:36:25,072 --> 00:36:27,002
我已经完成了我的任务，而且我的罪孽已经够深厚了
I have done my duty and I have sinned enough.

533
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:28,392
我离职
I resign.

534
00:36:29,092 --> 00:36:30,502
这是开小差
That's desertion.

535
00:36:31,182 --> 00:36:33,192
我已经是个叛国的造反者了
I am a traitor and a rebel,

536
00:36:33,282 --> 00:36:35,222
为什么不再加上个逃脱者的名字？
why not a deserter as well?

537
00:36:35,272 --> 00:36:37,341
你不能就这样离开13军团
You can't just leave the 13th.

538
00:36:44,711 --> 00:36:46,391
再见，波罗
Goodbye, Pullo.

539
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,041
至维纳斯，生育的主宰者，我为您献上这份祭礼
To venus, the birth giver, I make this sacrifice.

540
00:36:57,771 --> 00:37:02,161
我是乌瑞纳斯氏族的卢西尔斯，斯特拉迪纳部落
I am Lucius of the vorenian clan, tribe of Stellatina,

541
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:04,801
前任的13军团主力步兵团
formerly First Spear Centurion to the Prime Cohort

542
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:07,160
矛兵百夫长
of the 13th Legion.

543
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,750
我有一个妻子
I have a wife.

544
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,310
她的名字叫内奥比
Her name is Niobe.

545
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,150
维纳斯，请让她像我爱她那样爱我
venus, let her love me as I love her.

546
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,530
我奉献我的血，希望能够达到目的
I give my blood to make it so.

547
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:48,319
对不起，我没有吓你的意思
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

548
00:38:02,808 --> 00:38:04,888
你真漂亮
You're very beautiful.

549
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:11,498
出于无知，我想看看我是否没有
I've come to see that it may be, through ignorance,

550
00:38:11,538 --> 00:38:13,348
像我应该的那样来对待你
that I have not treated you as I should.

551
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:14,728
  像我应该的那样来对待你   请不要
  As I should treat you.   Please, don't.

552
00:38:14,768 --> 00:38:17,548
我们结婚的时候你还只有13岁
When we married you had only 13 summers,

553
00:38:17,568 --> 00:38:19,688
而且我很快的就离开了
and soon enough I was gone.

554
00:38:21,368 --> 00:38:24,818
但是你现在已经是个女人了，而我对女人一无所知
But now you are a woman, and I know nothing of women.

555
00:38:24,868 --> 00:38:26,828
我所知道的都是士兵的东西
Soldiering is all I know.

556
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:29,947
很明显是没用的
Which is not useful.

557
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:35,647
我曾经是如此的郁闷，冷淡跟不信任
I have been sullen and untrusting and cold.

558
00:38:36,757 --> 00:38:39,167
但是我不是石头做的
But I am not made of stone.

559
00:38:41,317 --> 00:38:43,517
我可以改
I can change.

560
00:38:43,577 --> 00:38:45,157
我可以用我女儿的儿子来发誓
I will swear on the life of my daughter's son.

561
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:48,577
我会改的，如果你是这么希望的话
I will change, if you would have it so.

562
00:38:48,977 --> 00:38:50,567
请告诉我如果你不愿意的话
Please, speak if you would not have it so,

563
00:38:50,597 --> 00:38:52,867
我会离开并且不会恨你
and I will leave without rancor.

564
00:38:57,986 --> 00:39:01,666
  是我做错了事   怎么呢？
  It is I have done wrong.   How so?

565
00:39:04,996 --> 00:39:06,946
我是…
I am...

566
00:39:07,756 --> 00:39:10,416
我没有能够…
I have not been...

567
00:39:16,946 --> 00:39:18,966
过去的已经过去了
The past is gone.

568
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:21,346
我们可以重新开始吗？
Can we start again?

569
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,638
Ha!

570
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,280
我不得不赞赏你
I applaud you.

571
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,480
你就要像一个血淋淋的征服者一样进入罗马了
You're about to enter Rome as a bloodstained conqueror,

572
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,470
但是你看起来就像一杯水那样平静
and yet you look as calm as a cup of water.

573
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,660
我很高兴我看起来如此
I am glad I appear so.

574
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:19,549
加咯斯，来点更高兴的音乐
Gracchus, something more cheerful.

575
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:06,548

1
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,258
白天很热
The day was hot,

2
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,018
但似乎夜晚温度降的很快
but the night turns chilly fast, it seems, for the time of year.

3
00:02:13,228 --> 00:02:16,658
 对于这个时节来说  后天我们就能到卡普阿
Day after tomorrow, we shall be in Capua

4
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,908
你就能在又大又暖和的房子里睡觉了
and you will sleep in a good warm house.

5
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:21,578
即使是山羊皮也有自己的优点
Though goatskin has its virtues.

6
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:24,488
现在好了 成了自己领土上的难民
Here we are, refugees in our own land.

7
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:28,548
我们不是难民 我们是在转移
We are not refugees. We are maneuvering.

8
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:32,008
就像你说的，我们在转移
As you say, here we are maneuvering,

9
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:34,968
那个暴君却占据了罗马
while the tyrant sits in Rome.

10
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:36,620
没错，在我自己的帐篷里
Yes, in my tent,

11
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,887
我可以熟睡的像个孩子一样
I sleep sound and deep as a child.

12
00:02:41,278 --> 00:02:45,138
 可能今晚不是  对不起让你受打扰，
 Though perhaps not tonight.  I'm sorry it bothers you.

13
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,695
他很快就结束了
He'll be finished soon enough.

14
00:02:48,088 --> 00:02:51,128
昆特斯对此比较有诀窍
Quintus has a knack for this kind of thing.

15
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:52,528
希望如此
Well, I hope so.

16
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:56,518
我不知道你儿子昆特斯和我们一起
Your son Quintus, I did not know he was with us.

17
00:02:56,548 --> 00:02:59,958
从布林迪西出发，今早到的
Arrived this morning from Brindisi.

18
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:05,428
这样好多了
Ah,that's better.

19
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:08,478
我发现尖叫声真是很差的调味料
Screaming makes poor sauce, I find.

20
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:10,768
昆特斯虽然有他的缺点
Quintus has his faults,

21
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:13,868
但他很忠诚而且毫无畏惧
but he is loyal and fearless.

22
00:03:13,888 --> 00:03:16,668
对于一个父亲来说不能要求再多了
Afathercannotaskmore.

23
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,968
我从来没听过，也没想过其他方面
I've never heard nor thought otherwise.

24
00:03:21,438 --> 00:03:23,618
那只狗终于招供了
The dog confessed at last.

25
00:03:23,658 --> 00:03:29,197
你脸上有血，去洗
 Torn up good and red.  Blood on your face. Wash yourself.

26
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:34,887
多里奥在哪里？ 金子又在哪里？
Where is Durio? Where is the gold?

27
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:38,387
就像你怀疑的那样，他把多里奥杀掉了
He killed Durio as you suspected.

28
00:03:38,437 --> 00:03:42,057
然后拿了金子沿着弗拉明大道往北走
And they took the gold north on the via Flaminia,

29
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,737
正好碰到了凯撒的巡逻兵
ran slap into Caesar's scouts.

30
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:47,127
两个罗马人，二十个尤比恩骑兵
Pair of Romans, 20 head of Ubian.

31
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:49,007
对我们的人来说太多了
Too many for our boys.

32
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:52,067
他们逃跑了，这些没用的垃圾
They ran, the filth that they are.

33
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,777
把金子留给了罗马侦察兵
Left the gold to the scouts.

34
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:57,467
这不可能 据我最近的消息
Can't be so. I've heard from Rome this last hour.

35
00:03:57,497 --> 00:03:59,127
凯撒并没有得到金子
Caesar has not got the gold.

36
00:03:59,177 --> 00:04:03,117
父亲，我的手下沃普总是能得到准确的消息
My man volpe always gets the truth, Father.

37
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:06,147
如果凯撒没得到金子 那肯定是他的侦察兵占为己有了
If Caesar does not have it, then his scouts must have kept it for themselves.

38
00:04:06,177 --> 00:04:08,147
 去找到这些侦察兵  我会的
 Go find these scouts.  I will.

39
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,397
现在！
Now!

40
00:04:14,457 --> 00:04:16,817
你看，现在形势已经在变了
You see, the tide turns already.

41
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,717
没有这些金子
Without the gold, Caesar will find Rome

42
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:22,397
凯撒会发现罗马更难被征服
a little harder to subdue.

43
00:04:22,437 --> 00:04:26,787
没有金子，我们的日子也不太好过
Without the gold, we're not very well placed, either.

44
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:30,157
没有金子，他会开始使用暴力
Without gold, he will have to use violence.

45
00:04:30,177 --> 00:04:32,047
一旦流血开始
Once he starts spilling blood,

46
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:36,047
人民会去向他复仇
the people will turn on him with a vengeance.

47
00:04:36,117 --> 00:04:40,456
没有了人民，他就什么都没有了
Without the people, he has nothing.

48
00:04:50,486 --> 00:04:53,186
戒严法现在生效
"Martial law is in effect

49
00:04:53,216 --> 00:04:56,016
为了所有公民的安全
for the safety of all citizens.

50
00:04:56,056 --> 00:04:59,346
三人以上的团体
Groups of more than three men

51
00:04:59,426 --> 00:05:02,976
不允许在公共场合聚集
shall not congregate in public spaces.

52
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:05,036
宵禁开始生效
Acurfewis in effect.

53
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:08,626
任何人天黑以后在街道上出现
Any person found on the street after dark

54
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,456
会遭到审判
will be subject to summary judgment.

55
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:15,736
盖乌斯·优利乌斯·恺撒万岁
Long live General Gaius Julius Caesar,

56
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:19,806
共和国的救世主
savior of our Republic."

57
00:05:25,056 --> 00:05:27,726
次序！立定！
Order, halt!

58
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,986
天神朱庇特
Jupiter Optimus Maximus.

59
00:05:40,036 --> 00:05:43,806
天神朱庇特
Jupiter Optimus Maximus.

60
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:47,326
天神朱庇特
Jupiter Optimus Maximus.

61
00:05:47,486 --> 00:05:51,216
天神朱庇特
Jupiter Optimus Maximus.

62
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:55,235
天神朱庇特
Jupiter Optimus Maximus.

63
00:05:57,645 --> 00:06:01,985
天神朱庇特 天神朱庇特
Jupiter Optimus Maximus. Jupiter Optimus Maximus.

64
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:14,025
公民，请称呼你自己
Name yourself, citizen.

65
00:06:14,085 --> 00:06:16,275
优利亚的盖乌斯
Gaius of the Julii,

66
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:19,635
 名字是凯撒  请讲
called Caesar. Speak then.

67
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:22,815
我恭谦的请求进行占卜
I humbly ask that auguries be taken

68
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:25,165
罗马可能已经知道
that Rome might know

69
00:06:25,195 --> 00:06:27,885
诸神赞同我的行为
that the gods favor my actions.

70
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:30,635
由于你全副武装的进入城市
You've entered the city under arms.

71
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:34,475
我必须警告你很少会有吉兆
I must warn you that seldom augurs well.

72
00:06:34,715 --> 00:06:37,845
神知道我的意图是和平的
The gods know my intentions are peaceful.

73
00:06:38,075 --> 00:06:41,685
人民也必须知道
The people must know it also.

74
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,305
那好吧
So be it.

75
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:52,665
占卜将会在第一个洁净清晨进行
Augurieswill betaken on the first clean morning.

76
00:06:52,695 --> 00:06:57,245
当鸟儿飞翔的时候
Let the birds fly where they may.

77
00:07:11,384 --> 00:07:15,534
 怎么样，老乡？  惨着呢
How be, paisan? Miserable.

78
00:07:15,654 --> 00:07:17,684
为叛乱辛勤工作的奴隶
Slave of a rebel.

79
00:07:17,744 --> 00:07:20,034
至少还是成功的叛乱
A successful rebel at least.

80
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,974
陪审团还在外面 你们怎么样？
The jury's still out. And you, my child?

81
00:07:22,004 --> 00:07:26,684
万分不幸，在给一个残忍的女人当奴役
For true misery, try bondage to a bloody-minded woman.

82
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:33,934
凯撒说今晚的宴会上不要贝类食物
This dinner tonight, Caesar asks no shellfish.

83
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,914
这个是来宾列表
Here is a guest list.

84
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:43,924
我希望你的女主人清楚 这个宴会给她带来的荣耀
I hope your lady is aware of the honor done to her.

85
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:45,784
她非常清楚
She's very aware.

86
00:07:47,644 --> 00:07:51,034
事实上 凯撒的女主人将会是罗马的第一女士
Caesar's hostess is first woman  of the city, in effect.

87
00:07:51,064 --> 00:07:52,604
除了凯撒的妻子
Excepting Caesar's wife.

88
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:55,024
卡尔普蕊娜 凯撒要求
Calpurnia. Caesar requires that she's still and handsome

89
00:07:55,064 --> 00:07:59,124
她必须安分，漂亮，尊贵大方 没其它了
and dignified and... no more.

90
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:03,224
她就像雕像那样有型
She is a species of statue.

91
00:08:07,524 --> 00:08:10,364
这个名单很奇特
A very fancy list of people.

92
00:08:10,514 --> 00:08:14,094
每一个留下来的贵族都被邀请了
Every aristo and optimate left in the city.

93
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:18,494
他不会是准备把他们都杀掉吧？
He's not planning on killing them, is he?

94
00:08:18,574 --> 00:08:21,284
我不那么想
I shouldn't think so.

95
00:08:22,114 --> 00:08:25,444
我的女主人不喜欢意外
My mistress doesn't like surprises.

96
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:30,583
赛维莉娅- 为什么邀请她？
Servilia- why invite her?

97
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,533
他们之间还藕断丝连吗？
Can there still be something between them?

98
00:08:32,573 --> 00:08:36,043
像她那样慌乱的老破鞋？ 肯定不是
A rattled old sandal like her? Surely not.

99
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,063
她还有点姿色
Some juice in her yet.

100
00:08:38,763 --> 00:08:42,513
我不会让那个女人在我和凯撒之间掺合
I'll not let that woman get between me and Caesar.

101
00:08:44,493 --> 00:08:48,253
为什么赛维莉娅也被邀请来参加晚宴？
Why is Servilia invited to the party?

102
00:08:48,523 --> 00:08:52,003
优利亚的赛维莉娅 她为什么被邀请了？
Servilia of the Junii, why is she invited?

103
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:55,393
显然是因为她的儿子
On account of her son, obviously.

104
00:08:55,913 --> 00:08:58,503
你把我叫醒就为这个？
For this, you wake me?

105
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:03,113
当然了 他需要布鲁图斯作为他象征上的朋友
Of course. He needs to keep Brutus as his symbolic friend.

106
00:09:03,173 --> 00:09:04,763
仅此而已
That's all.

107
00:09:04,803 --> 00:09:08,153
如果布鲁图斯成为他的敌人 我看上去就和他们在一起了
It would look ill with the people if Brutus were his enemy.

108
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:11,173
他们之间并没有爱情 仅仅是政治而已
There's no love there. It's just politics.

109
00:09:11,273 --> 00:09:14,593
神啊，你这个女人能不能让我睡觉？
Dear gods, woman, would you let me sleep?

110
00:09:38,823 --> 00:09:40,383
多米那，山羊睾丸
The goat's testicles, domina.

111
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,682
傻瓜，不是给我的 给屋大维
Not for me, fool, for Octavian.

112
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,262
去找得墨忒耳
Fetch Demeter.

113
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:50,272
亲爱的，快趁热吃了
Eat them while they're warm, my dear.

114
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:52,862
 它能让你的阴茎长的像橡木一样  我宁可不要
 It puts oak in your penis.  I'd rather not.

115
00:09:52,912 --> 00:09:54,792
胡说，你必须吃
Nonsense, you must.

116
00:09:54,842 --> 00:09:57,082
你现在长的越来越女性化了
You've been developing a distinctly feminine anima,

117
00:09:57,132 --> 00:09:58,762
我不喜欢那样
and I do not like it.

118
00:09:58,802 --> 00:10:00,872
我不过是个男孩 这太自然不过了--
I am only a boy. It is entirely natural--

119
00:10:00,922 --> 00:10:04,662
当我外公你这么大的时候 没有一个女孩奴隶是安全的
When my mother's father was your age, there was not a slave girl safe.

120
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:06,612
我们优利亚家族的男人都是非常有男子气概的
The men of the Julii are masculine men. Now do as I say

121
00:10:06,652 --> 00:10:09,672
 现在听我的话把它吃了  我不
 and eat them.  I will not.

122
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:12,612
你不吃了它别想离开这个房间
You'll not leave this room until you do.

123
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:16,792
得墨忒耳，今晚的宴会不要有贝类食物
Demeter, the banquet this evening,

124
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:18,682
还有确保鳗鱼不要烧过了
no shellfish. And be sure the lampreys are not overcooked.

125
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:21,572
煮到能杀掉它们就不要再烧了
Boil them long enough to kill them, no more.

126
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:26,192
我还在等
I'm waiting.

127
00:10:34,102 --> 00:10:36,642
那才是我的儿子
That's my brave boy.

128
00:10:48,592 --> 00:10:51,432
 弟弟  嗯？
 Brother.  Hmm?

129
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:54,712
是不是妈妈找人把格雷毕斯杀掉的？
Did Mother have Glabius killed?

130
00:10:54,772 --> 00:10:56,551
当然不是
Of course not.

131
00:10:56,811 --> 00:10:57,941
你确定？
You're sure?

132
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,651
我不能证明，但我想应该是的
Well, I cannot prove a negative, but I'm sure as can be.

133
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,071
你以神的名义起誓？
You swear on Jupiter's stone?

134
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:07,921
我以神的名义起誓
I swear on Jupiter's stone.

135
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:11,801
如果确实
If she did,

136
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:14,211
如果确实是她杀了他的话
if she did kill him,

137
00:11:14,911 --> 00:11:19,491
以复仇女神的名义，我会用牙齿把她的喉管咬开
by the furies, I'll open her throat with my teeth.

138
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,090
在纳波，我能开十次这样的宴会了
In Narbo, I can buy 10 feasts for this.

139
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,750
纳波不是到处是尸体和士兵吗？
Narbo isn't full of corpses and soldiers,

140
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,930
正派人因为太害怕都不敢出门
and decent people too scared to come out of their houses.

141
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,090
如果你不介意我这么说的话
No time to throw a do if you don't mind me saying.

142
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,510
我不开个宴会就没法开始做生意，是不是？
I cannot start a business without a feast, can l?

143
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,530
今天是吉日，而且非常安全
Today is auspicious, and it's perfectly safe.

144
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,510
我记得上回苏拉的士兵还在的时候
I remember the last time when Sulla had soldiers in the city.

145
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,670
 血都可以用来刷墙了  凯撒不是苏拉
 Blood, you could paint houses with it.  Caesar's not Sulla.

146
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,970
他宣布了戒严法 是为了和平而不是流血
He's declared martial law, not to spill blood, but to keep the peace.

147
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,900
等着瞧吧，是不是？
We'll see, won't we?

148
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,240
我向谷神和酒神乞灵 你不会失望的
I invoke Ceres and Bacchus, you'll not be dissatisfied.

149
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,740
你为我找只猪，我就帮你办宴会
You find me a pig, and I'll make you a feast,

150
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,380
即使是在地狱里，如果需要的话
in Hades, if need be.

151
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,690
 照样收费  那个油商的老婆缪莎
 And charge according.  Musa, the oilman's wife,

152
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,890
在她葬礼上用了海螺而不是牡蛎
served whelks instead of oysters at her womb funeral,

153
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,710
没人会让她忘记那一切
and nobody would let her forget it.

154
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,260
在街上嘲笑她
Laughed at in the street.

155
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,509
神圣的门神啊，我们把这个宴会献给你
Divine Janus, we offer this feast to you.

156
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,129
我恭谦的乞求你能对我们宽厚
I humbly beg that you will be gracious

157
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:34,429
对我和我的家展现你的仁慈
and merciful to me and my house,

158
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:36,139
你会向这个从今天开始的商业冒险微笑
and you will smile upon this new business venture

159
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,877
I begin today.

160
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:44,059
卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯 尊贵的马克·安东尼想要召见你
Lucius vorenus, his honor Mark Antony orders your presence.

161
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:47,709
 现在？  当然不是，难道是明年？
 Now?  Of course not. Next year.

162
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:54,099
乌瑞纳斯，我亲爱的同志
vorenus, my dear comrade.

163
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:57,459
你手里没了血迹斑斑的长剑 我都认不出你来了
Barely recognize you without a bloody sword in your hand.

164
00:13:57,499 --> 00:13:59,409
卡托，你可以走了
Off with you now, Cato.

165
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:03,219
很有趣，是不是？
Amusing, eh?

166
00:14:04,099 --> 00:14:06,719
 卡托  就像你说的
 Cato.  As you say.

167
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:10,089
你当然不会感到有趣
Of course you don't all find it amusing.

168
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:12,429
那么…
So...

169
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:15,729
你的平民生活过的怎么样？
how is civilian life treating you, huh?

170
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:18,009
目前为止还不错，长官
Well enough so far, sir.

171
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:20,429
对了，当然了
You know, of course,

172
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:23,409
由于你逃跑，我可以将你钉在十字架上
I could have you nailed to a cross for desertion.

173
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:26,789
我没有叛逃 我的服役结束了
I am no deserter. My time was served.

174
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:28,459
我坚守了我的誓言
I abided my sacrament.

175
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:31,099
这是你…
It is you that...

176
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:34,499
这是为什么？
It is I that what?

177
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,539
一旦越过卢比肯河 罗马人就不再是士兵而是公民了
Once over the Rubicon, Romans are citizens, not soldiers.

178
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:41,369
 我就不能再做之前做过的那些事了  傻瓜
I could not legally do other than I did. Foolish.

179
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:46,148
 就像被斗篷蒙蔽了眼睛的牧师一样
Like a priest blinded by a cowl.

180
00:14:46,188 --> 00:14:46,398
自从罗马成立…
Since the founding of Rome--

181
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,182
算了吧，乌瑞纳斯，绕了我
Oh, please, spare me the founding, vorenus.

182
00:14:49,728 --> 00:14:51,558
事物总是在变的
Things change.

183
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:53,998
生活是水，而不是石头
Life is water, not stone.

184
00:14:54,048 --> 00:14:56,078
那我想我会被淹死
Then I suppose I will drown.

185
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:59,228
你难道看不见你心中宝贵的共和国
Do you not see that your precious Republic

186
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:00,728
已经湮没很久了吗？
has long since died?

187
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:04,388
你看不见凯撒正把罗马从废墟中拯救出来吗？
Do you not see that Caesar is trying to save Rome from ruin?

188
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:06,668
我不觉得
I do not see that.

189
00:15:08,358 --> 00:15:10,618
够了
Enough.

190
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:14,218
那么什么样可怜的贸易
Andwhatwretchedtrade

191
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:16,558
是你想从事的？
is it you intend to follow then?

192
00:15:16,588 --> 00:15:19,248
从高卢进口货物 奴隶，软糖和酒
Imported goods from Gaul. Slaves, truffles, wine.

193
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:22,478
 就这些东西？  一个杂货商？
 That sort of thing.  A grocer?

194
00:15:22,908 --> 00:15:25,488
像你这样一个战士
An honest fighting man like yourself

195
00:15:25,548 --> 00:15:27,518
清点箱子
counting cartons,

196
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:29,738
乱记帐目
scribbling accounts?

197
00:15:29,988 --> 00:15:33,358
 你会发疯的  可能吧
 You will swift go mad.  That may be.

198
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,718
我需要你，乌瑞纳斯
I need you, vorenus.

199
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:41,428
凯撒需要你
Caesar needs you.

200
00:15:41,428 --> 00:15:44,948
军团里没有别人比你得到更多的尊重
There is no better man in the legion, none more respected by the men.

201
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:48,248
 在前面我们有艰苦的战斗  针对罗马人的艰苦的战斗
 We have hard fighting ahead.  Hard fighting against Romans.

202
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:50,718
血就是血
Blood is blood.

203
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:52,108
你真的想让十三军团的战士们
Would you really have the 13th

204
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:55,552
在没有你的情况下，批甲戴盔？
fasten their crest without you?

205
00:15:58,098 --> 00:16:00,367
你要回军团来
You come back to the legion,

206
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:04,887
你会变的完美
you shall be inducted into the Evocati as a prefect.

207
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:10,627
在第一等级中，你还能得到奖赏
Of the first grade, with a signing bonus.

208
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:12,327
好比…
Say, uh...

209
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:15,477
一万塞斯特斯？
10,000 sesterce.

210
00:16:19,517 --> 00:16:23,837
我选择了这条路 无论如何我都会走下去
I chose this path. I will follow where it leads.

211
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:28,457
乌瑞纳斯，你伤我的心了
You grieve me, vorenus.

212
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:32,437
你深深的伤害了我
You grieve me deeply.

213
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:35,787
算了，你走吧
Go on. Off with you.

214
00:16:37,657 --> 00:16:39,477
日安，公民
Good day, citizen.

215
00:16:40,517 --> 00:16:42,107
乌瑞纳斯
vorenus...

216
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:47,847
下次再看见你，我可能就不会这么友善了
next time I see you, I may not be so kind.

217
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,517
上面说什么？
What does it say?

218
00:17:08,547 --> 00:17:11,027
不是很确定
It's not certain,

219
00:17:11,227 --> 00:17:14,146
不过我可以看出你的秘密很安全
but I'd say your secret's safe.

220
00:17:14,186 --> 00:17:16,086
不确定？
Not certain?

221
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:18,506
征兆混在一起
The signs are mixed.

222
00:17:18,546 --> 00:17:19,441
那会怎么样？
What good is that?

223
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,540
告诉我你想掩盖什么
Tell me what it is you're hiding

224
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:25,936
我便能更准确地告诉你结果
and I can be more precise.

225
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:30,536
其中有一个孩子
There's a child involved.

226
00:17:32,576 --> 00:17:35,306
一个男孩？
Amalechild?

227
00:17:35,526 --> 00:17:37,626
婴儿？
The baby.

228
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:41,096
算了吧
Never mind. Best leave it.

229
00:17:41,136 --> 00:17:43,366
随便你
As you please.

230
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:46,866
不过如果能帮到你的话，
If it's any help,

231
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:51,528
上面显示, 你丈夫会变的很富有
it does say your husband is going to be rich.

232
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,097
就像一个大富豪
Rich as Croesus.

233
00:17:57,696 --> 00:18:00,136
总算还有点什么，是不是？
Well, that's something, isn't it?

234
00:18:02,246 --> 00:18:04,066
谢谢你
Thank you.

235
00:18:22,696 --> 00:18:25,276
好了，完成了
Good. Done.

236
00:18:29,715 --> 00:18:31,335
水
Water.

237
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:48,915
我八年前看上去如何？
What did I look like eight years ago?

238
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:51,335
和现在一模一样
Just the same.

239
00:18:51,995 --> 00:18:54,665
 八年  八年
 Eight years.  Eight years...

240
00:18:54,705 --> 00:18:57,025
在粗糙的高卢妓女中间
of leathery Gallic trollops.

241
00:18:57,065 --> 00:19:00,525
他最后是什么时候见过一个真正的女士？
When did he last see a real lady, hmm?

242
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:03,145
而且是如此漂亮的一个
And such a beautiful one?

243
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:17,065
 鲜花  盛开的？
 Flowers.  In bloom?

244
00:19:26,805 --> 00:19:30,125
给每个这些官员的书记员五万
50,000 to each of the magistrate's clerks.

245
00:19:30,195 --> 00:19:32,155
这么多？
So much?

246
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:35,645
我要把他们的忠诚彻底买断 而不是不断的去续约
I wish to buy their allegiance outright, not lease it.

247
00:19:35,685 --> 00:19:37,925
要让他们签字
Have them sign for the money.

248
00:19:37,995 --> 00:19:40,925
那么给次级执政官多少？
And how much for the sub-praetors?

249
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:42,485
零
Nil.

250
00:19:42,545 --> 00:19:45,984
当他们听说书记员拿了多少钱 他们会过来乞讨的
When they hear how much the clerks got, they'll come begging.

251
00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:49,154
这样会让我们没有任何资源来维持这个城市
And leave us penniless without means to run the city.

252
00:19:49,194 --> 00:19:52,184
我们必须杀掉一些富人然后拿走他们财产
We must kill some rich men and take their money very soon,

253
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:56,104
否则井水很快就会耗干的
else the well will run dry

254
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,114
很快
very soon.

255
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,427
 杀戮是毫无必要的
I plan on killing no one unless absolutely necessary.

256
00:20:00,164 --> 00:20:04,824
 找个贵族的策略，来点意外  毫无疑问
Afine novel strategy, an element of surprise no doubt.

257
00:20:04,894 --> 00:20:07,724
晚点再听你的唠叨
Later you may nag me.

258
00:20:15,194 --> 00:20:18,254
我相信这是合适的
I believe this is appropriate.

259
00:20:19,664 --> 00:20:21,994
没错，亲爱的
Exactly right, my dear.

260
00:20:22,064 --> 00:20:25,864
华丽，但不过分
Regal, but not excessively so.

261
00:20:25,894 --> 00:20:28,474
真是个好的开始 如果没人来的话
Fine start to a business this'll be if nobody comes.

262
00:20:28,524 --> 00:20:31,174
别担心，他们会来的
Don't worry. They will come.

263
00:20:36,574 --> 00:20:39,164
或许我该听你的再等等
Maybe I should have waited as you said.

264
00:20:39,844 --> 00:20:41,894
他们会来的
They will come.

265
00:20:44,654 --> 00:20:47,404
记得，当他们来的时候
And mind now, when they do come,

266
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,124
试着偶尔笑一下
try to smile occasionally.

267
00:20:50,324 --> 00:20:52,804
别向他们咆哮
And don'tbarkatthem.

268
00:20:53,764 --> 00:20:55,184
这是谁？
Who's this?

269
00:20:55,224 --> 00:20:58,394
伊拉斯特斯·弗尔曼 记得吗？ 我们尊贵的客人
Erastes Fulmen. Remember? Our guest of honor.

270
00:20:58,434 --> 00:21:00,483
建筑贸易，火灾保险，橄榄
Building trades, fire insurance, olives.

271
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:02,753
卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯
Lucius Vorenus.

272
00:21:05,183 --> 00:21:06,813
内奥比
Niobe.

273
00:21:07,393 --> 00:21:09,123
感谢你们能光临，尊贵的邻居
Thank you for your coming, honest neighbor.

274
00:21:09,153 --> 00:21:11,203
我知道在这样的日子里能来很不容易
I know it can't be easy on such a day.

275
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:13,403
来几个士兵又怎样？
What's a few soldiers, eh?

276
00:21:13,553 --> 00:21:15,573
菲利斯，我的妻子
Wife, Phyllis.

277
00:21:16,473 --> 00:21:17,383
请
Please.

278
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:20,623
 请坐，先喝两杯酒  好的
 Sit down and take a cup of wine.  I will.

279
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:22,803
有点渴了，呵
Thirsty road, eh?

280
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,093
姐姐
Sister.

281
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:32,603
你没事吧？
All right?

282
00:21:32,653 --> 00:21:35,213
都很好，别担心
All's right. Don't worry.

283
00:21:35,303 --> 00:21:37,683
 谢谢  这不会是我小巧的莱得吧？
 Thank you.  This can't be little Lyde.

284
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:40,993
 好久没见了  你好，卢西尔斯
 Surely not. Long time, eh?  Salve, Lucius.

285
00:21:41,563 --> 00:21:44,523
 这是我丈夫，伊万德·普契洛  欢迎，伊万德
 This is my husband, Evander Pulchio.  Evander, welcome.

286
00:21:44,563 --> 00:21:46,933
 卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯，我很荣幸  谢谢你们送的猪
 Honored, Lucius vorenus.  Thank you for the pig.

287
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:49,233
所有店都关门了 为了这点肉我们可以尽情欢呼了
With all the shops shut, we would have whistled for meat.

288
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:51,423
很高兴能帮到忙
Happy to be of service.

289
00:22:27,272 --> 00:22:29,872
 非常感谢你能邀请我  这是我的荣幸
 Thank you so much for inviting me.  My pleasure.

290
00:22:29,912 --> 00:22:31,832
我的荣幸，赛维莉娅
My pleasure, Servilia.

291
00:22:31,952 --> 00:22:34,592
我坚持说你必须要来
I insisted you come.

292
00:22:34,772 --> 00:22:37,252
不管你遇到什么样的不幸
Whatever misfortune befalls you,

293
00:22:37,302 --> 00:22:39,932
我们依然是朋友，对吗？
we're still friends, neh?

294
00:22:49,982 --> 00:22:51,792
我得承认，她有个很好的帮她化妆的奴隶
She has a good cosmetics slave, I'll grant you.

295
00:22:51,832 --> 00:22:55,842
但是作为凯撒的情人？ 荒谬
But a lover for Caesar? Absurd.

296
00:23:12,842 --> 00:23:16,932
请为高级执政官让路 盖乌斯·优利乌斯·恺撒
Make way for the pro-consul Gaius Julius Caesar,

297
00:23:16,972 --> 00:23:18,702
维纳斯的儿子
Son of venus,

298
00:23:18,752 --> 00:23:21,502
高卢军团的最高统治者
Imperator of the Gallic Legions.

299
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:24,712
退后致礼
Stand aside and open up.

300
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:41,601
别戏弄我了，我不过是你的叔叔盖乌斯 把头抬起来
Please, you mock me. It's only your Uncle Gaius. Lift your heads.

301
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:48,321
所有的人都把头抬起来
All of you, lift your heads.

302
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:54,581
我亲爱的侄女
My dear niece.

303
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:56,561
尊敬的叔叔
Revered uncle,

304
00:23:56,621 --> 00:23:59,581
欢迎回家
welcome, welcome home.

305
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:23,181
优利亚的赛维莉娅 非常荣幸
Servilia of the Junii, a pleasant honor it is.

306
00:24:24,011 --> 00:24:26,101
非常高兴
Delightful.

307
00:24:26,171 --> 00:24:28,561
这是我的荣幸
Your pleasure is mine.

308
00:24:28,891 --> 00:24:32,831
我非常遗憾你的儿子不在这里
I am very sorry your son is not here with you.

309
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:37,171
我也一样
I'm sorry also.

310
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:40,891
希望你能原谅他的缺席
I hope you will forgive his absence.

311
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:44,771
他永远是你的朋友
He is ever your friend.

312
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,700
我完全理解
I understand completely.

313
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,540
请向布鲁图斯传送我最诚挚的敬意
Please send Brutus my best regards

314
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,440
我保证他永远都不会有机会
and assure him he will never have reason

315
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,130
对我们之间的友谊后悔
to regret our friendship.

316
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:03,270
不管是谁向其他人效忠过
Nor will any of you, regardless of where your allegiances

317
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,180
都既往不咎
may have lain in the past.

318
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,550
 有武器吗？  没有，长官
 Any weapons?  None, sir.

319
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,280
 你们从哪里来的？  从安特纳姆来
 Where you coming from?  Come from Aternum, dominus.

320
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,710
 做什么贸易？  收集尸体，研磨骨头
 In what trade?  Corpse collectors, bone grinders.

321
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,100
总体上说做死人生意的
Dead business in general.

322
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,170
那你们真是来对地方了
You've come to right place then.

323
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,010
他们是谁？
What people are they?

324
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,810
是锡西厄人，长官 他们不说我们的语言
Scythians, chief. They don't speak our language.

325
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,160
那你们过去吧
On your way then.

326
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,830
让我们进去！
Please let me in!

327
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,307
你！
You!

328
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,820
告诉你的手下，离高贵的妇女们远点
Tell your brutes to stay away from decent women.

329
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,340
我会的
I'll do that.

330
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,920
这些你从高卢人那抢来的东西可真不错
Fine bit of plunder and rapine you made off them bloody Gauls,

331
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,280
 我打赌  我不会抱怨的
 I bet.  I'll not complain.

332
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,379
这种动荡的时代还真容易挣钱
Handy to have cash in these uncertain times.

333
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:05,119
男人不能离开自己的产业去逃跑
A man can't flee with his house and fields

334
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:07,689
如果他选错阵营的话
if he's chosen the wrong side.

335
00:26:08,189 --> 00:26:09,649
没错
True.

336
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:11,399
你认为谁会最终取胜？
Who do you reckon will come out on top?

337
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:13,239
这很难说
It's hard to say.

338
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:16,189
你会不会希望是你自己的人？
You'll be hoping it'll be your man though, eh?

339
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:19,429
如果你说的是凯撒的话，他已经不是自己人了
If you mean Caesar, he's not my man anymore.

340
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:24,409
所以你的战利品
So your spoils,

341
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:26,799
我期望你会出租你的收益
you'll be lending the proceeds, I expect.

342
00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:28,409
我不会的
I won't.

343
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:32,209
我把这里买下来因此不会有额外的现款
I am buying back this insula so I'll not have spare cash.

344
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:35,629
我打算把这儿的贸易空间用来做进口生意
I plan to take over the trading space for an import business.

345
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:39,569
 主要是奴隶  奴隶？
 Slaves mostly.  Slaves?

346
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:42,169
听着
Well, listen,

347
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:44,439
我有一些朋友
I have friends,

348
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:47,049
很好的朋友
bona friends.

349
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:51,869
如果你需要帮助，你来就找我
If you want any help, you come to me, eh?

350
00:26:52,449 --> 00:26:55,159
再来点酒，甜心
More wine here, sweetie.

351
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:01,069
那儿还有些很不明智的人
There are even those unwise men

352
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:04,649
说出现在南部象限仪上的一只白鸟
who say that a white bird in the southern quadrant

353
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:07,899
既不指示什么也不否定什么
is neither indicant nor negation.

354
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:11,689
这真是我们时代里野蛮的革新
Such are the barbarous innovations of our day.

355
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,429
野蛮
Barbarous.

356
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:16,199
我们可能会成为叙利亚人
We might as well be Syrian.

357
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:19,768
 我非常同意  叙利亚人，没错
 Point to pommel, I agree.  Syrians, indeed.

358
00:27:19,818 --> 00:27:21,258
甚至是锡西厄人
Scythians even.

359
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:25,028
作为首席占卜师，我很高兴听到你这么说
As Chief Augur, I'm gratified to hear you say so.

360
00:27:25,068 --> 00:27:28,218
据说你的观点都很时髦
It was heard you are a man  of modish opinion.

361
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:32,518
哦，那些都是流言
Oh, that's pure scandal.

362
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:36,498
我坚信宗教是我们杰出的教士们的职责
I believe that religion is the province of our worthy priests.

363
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:40,138
像我这样的战士最好不要去干涉
Mere soldiers like myself best not interfere.

364
00:27:40,178 --> 00:27:42,048
那真是很令人高兴
That's very gratifying.

365
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:44,338
屋大维，别像个穷人那样坐在那里
Octavian, don't sit there like a prole.

366
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:47,168
 说一些有意义的话  我没有什么好说的
 Say something witty.  I have nothing such to say.

367
00:27:47,228 --> 00:27:48,738
你知道我不能说，母亲
You know I cannot talk small, Mother.

368
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,097
那你好了
You then.

369
00:27:51,468 --> 00:27:52,948
念些诗歌如何？
Some poetry, neh?

370
00:27:52,988 --> 00:27:55,878
她能很快的背诵这些东西
She can rattle off pages of the stuff.

371
00:27:59,628 --> 00:28:02,038
“去往地狱很容易
"Easy it is to go down into Hell.

372
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:04,658
死亡的大门总是敞开着
The gates of death are ever open.

373
00:28:04,688 --> 00:28:08,798
困难的是要重新爬回”
To climb back out again, that's the difficulty."

374
00:28:13,468 --> 00:28:16,888
有点阴暗，亲爱的，不过没关系
It's a touch dark, my love, but never mind.

375
00:28:16,998 --> 00:28:20,038
她刚失去她的丈夫
She lost her husband, you know.

376
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:47,817
最好把你姐姐带走
Best get your sister gone.

377
00:28:47,867 --> 00:28:49,717
我告诉过你让她来是个错误
I told you it was a mistake to let her come.

378
00:28:49,747 --> 00:28:53,657
我必须得让她来，否则看上去会很奇怪
I had to let her come. It would look odd if she wasn't here.

379
00:28:54,647 --> 00:28:57,387
去跟伊万德说一下，好不好？
Speak to Evander, will you?

380
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,257
屠夫，该把你老婆带回去了
Butcher man, time to take your wife home.

381
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,527
她不想走F
She doesn't want to go.

382
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:06,127
最好让她走
Best make her go then, eh?

383
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,857
 是时候回家了  不
 Time to go.  Not yet.

384
00:29:12,887 --> 00:29:15,507
 我喜欢这儿  是时候走了
 I like it here.  Time to go.

385
00:29:15,557 --> 00:29:18,627
 放开我，亲爱的  莱得，不要这样
 Let me go, my love.  Lyde, please.

386
00:29:18,677 --> 00:29:20,267
放开我
Let me go

387
00:29:20,337 --> 00:29:22,987
否则我会告诉我们勇敢的战士一个非常好的故事
or I'll tell our brave soldier such a good tale.

388
00:29:23,037 --> 00:29:26,187
你要害死我们？ 这是不是你想要得？
Kill us all? Is that what you want?

389
00:29:27,377 --> 00:29:32,017
我爱你，可你为什么不爱我？
I love you. Why don't you love me?

390
00:29:32,297 --> 00:29:36,037
对不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

391
00:29:38,047 --> 00:29:41,107
 莱得，不要这样  我是你的妻子
 Lyde, please.  I'm your wife.

392
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:43,897
我们有协议的！ 你向神发过誓的！
We had an agreement! You vowed to Persephone.

393
00:29:43,937 --> 00:29:45,417
你发誓你会保持沉默
You vowed you would hold your peace!

394
00:29:45,457 --> 00:29:48,156
 我难道没有保持沉默吗？  如果我的丈夫--
 Have I not held my peace?  If my husband--

395
00:29:48,196 --> 00:29:52,126
你的丈夫是个瞎子！
Your husband is a blind fool!

396
00:29:52,186 --> 00:29:54,906
你听到了吗？ 他又瞎又傻
Did you hear me? He's a blind fool!

397
00:29:58,626 --> 00:30:01,636
放开我！ 放开我！
Get off me! Get off me!

398
00:30:02,656 --> 00:30:04,326
放开我！
Get off me!

399
00:30:17,236 --> 00:30:19,116
妻子？
Wife?

400
00:30:22,786 --> 00:30:24,936
卡西里亚
Caecilia.

401
00:30:29,856 --> 00:30:31,386
能不能告诉我
Tell me,

402
00:30:31,426 --> 00:30:33,386
卡西里亚现在怎么样？
how is Caecilia?

403
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:37,896
 她很健康，谢谢  很好
 She's healthy, I thank you.  Good.

404
00:30:37,946 --> 00:30:42,736
我想起来我忘记了你妻子上个生日
I recall I forgot her last birthday.

405
00:30:43,026 --> 00:30:44,946
 她的生日？  我知道这是我的错
 Her birthday?  Remiss of me, I know.

406
00:30:44,996 --> 00:30:48,756
她也许能原谅我如果我能再送给她些礼物
Perhaps she would forgive my rudeness were I to send her a gift.

407
00:30:48,796 --> 00:30:51,476
真的，那没必要
Really, that's not necessary.

408
00:30:51,536 --> 00:30:53,956
为女人挑礼物真的很难
Hard to find the right gift for a woman, neh?

409
00:30:54,016 --> 00:30:56,886
这个人喜欢的，又被别人亲篾
What one loves, another scorns.

410
00:30:56,946 --> 00:30:59,406
可能她会接受一点钱
Perhaps she would accept some money.

411
00:30:59,466 --> 00:31:01,496
这个注意不错
There's an idea.

412
00:31:01,976 --> 00:31:05,655
十万塞斯特斯怎么样？
100,000 sesterce, say?

413
00:31:05,705 --> 00:31:08,035
那真是非常慷慨
Oh, that's very kind of you.

414
00:31:08,095 --> 00:31:12,365
但是恐怕我的妻子的品位是很昂贵的
I'm afraid my wife is a woman of expensive tastes.

415
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:13,935
最好的女人都是这样的
The best women often are.

416
00:31:13,985 --> 00:31:15,465
十五万
1 50,000.

417
00:31:15,515 --> 00:31:19,985
如果我允许的话她甚至会让她的奴隶们穿上丝绸
She would dress her slaves in silk if I would let her.

418
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:25,615
她每天早晨都吃牡蛎
She eats oysters for breakfast daily.

419
00:31:26,505 --> 00:31:28,805
她应该小心一些
She should be most careful.

420
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,583
很多人都会被牡蛎噎到
People often choke on oysters.

421
00:31:32,255 --> 00:31:34,525
二十万
200,000.

422
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:37,005
那真是非常慷慨，我愿意说那是
That is a very generous, and I may say,

423
00:31:37,055 --> 00:31:39,875
一件非常合适的礼物
appropriate gift.

424
00:31:40,735 --> 00:31:43,245
她会深深的欠你一个人情的
She would be under great obligation to you.

425
00:31:43,305 --> 00:31:45,405
她只要能想到我就不欠我了
To think well of me would be her only obligation.

426
00:31:45,505 --> 00:31:48,555
她总是能想到你
She's always thought well of you.

427
00:31:48,935 --> 00:31:54,595
她能继续这么做不会是件不道德的事情的
It is not unethical she continue to do so.

428
00:31:55,365 --> 00:31:58,965
我们能理解对方
We understand each other.

429
00:32:02,215 --> 00:32:04,795
把这记下来
Make a note of it.

430
00:32:04,865 --> 00:32:08,275
二十万给首席占卜师
200 to the Chief Augur.

431
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:11,455
那个笨蛋猜他自己是个财主
Thinks he's Midas, the loon.

432
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,565
 Go past the cloth works.  Thank you very much.

433
00:32:21,294 --> 00:32:23,564
明早第一件事我们得去拜访门神的牧师们
We'll go to the priests of Janus tomorrow first thing,

434
00:32:23,614 --> 00:32:26,694
希望今天的事能得到宽恕 这很昂贵，但是…
and have the day absolved. It's costly, but--

435
00:32:26,724 --> 00:32:28,844
征兆就是征兆，不好的时候它们总是会来
An omen is an omen. And this is as bad as they come.

436
00:32:28,904 --> 00:32:31,544
没必要往里面扔钱
No point throwing money at it.

437
00:32:33,554 --> 00:32:36,774
你姐姐和她丈夫以后不允许再来了
Your sister and her husband can never come here again.

438
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:38,214
就照你说的吧
As you say.

439
00:32:38,274 --> 00:32:39,734
不能够屈服
Must not bend.

440
00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:44,134
你好啊，平民
Salve, pleb.

441
00:32:45,484 --> 00:32:47,824
百夫长卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯？
Centurion Lucius vorenus?

442
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:49,214
你是谁？
Who asks?

443
00:32:49,274 --> 00:32:51,574
尊贵的昆特斯·庞贝阁下
His honor Quintus Pompey.

444
00:32:51,624 --> 00:32:53,694
你最好对此有个解释
You best have good reason for this insult.

445
00:32:53,744 --> 00:32:56,684
你这只狗最好快点告诉我金子在哪里？
Tell me where the gold is, and quick about it, dog.

446
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,254
什么金子？ 说点有意义的话
What gold? Speak sense.

447
00:33:01,634 --> 00:33:04,164
 这样够不够有意义？  不够
 Sense enough?  Not near.

448
00:33:04,214 --> 00:33:09,044
 我再问一遍，什么金子？  他是不是很顽固？
 I ask again, what gold?  Stubborn is he?

449
00:33:10,774 --> 00:33:15,534
我猜这个婊子是你老婆
This trollop we can assume is your wife.

450
00:33:16,724 --> 00:33:18,584
抓住她
Hold her.

451
00:33:21,504 --> 00:33:23,204
我没法说我不知道的事情
I cannot speak what I do not know.

452
00:33:23,264 --> 00:33:24,624
我不知道任何关于金子的事
I do not know of any gold.

453
00:33:24,664 --> 00:33:27,774
你知道的很清楚我是在找国库黄金
You know very well I seek the treasury gold

454
00:33:27,804 --> 00:33:30,024
你从我父亲手下那里抢去的
you took from my father's men.

455
00:33:30,064 --> 00:33:33,164
我没有从任何人那里抢走金子 你被误导了
I took no gold from any man. You are misinformed.

456
00:33:33,214 --> 00:33:35,373
误导
Misinformed.

457
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:40,153
你难道不是第十三军团侦察兵的头么？
You are not chief of scouts 13th legion?

458
00:33:40,843 --> 00:33:41,463
曾经是
I was.

459
00:33:41,523 --> 00:33:44,753
上周你是不是截住了一辆装运谷物的马车
And last week, did you not stop a grain wagon

460
00:33:44,793 --> 00:33:48,073
 在弗拉明大道上？  是的
 on the via Flaminia?  We did.

461
00:33:48,343 --> 00:33:49,793
赶车的人是由士兵伪装的
Driven by soldiers disguised.

462
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,160
是那些士兵把马车丢下的
We chased the soldiers and left the wagon.

463
00:33:53,443 --> 00:33:54,733
你就没想过要看看里面是什么？
You never thought to look inside?

464
00:33:54,793 --> 00:33:57,863
我们有命令在身，没有时间
There was no time. We had orders.

465
00:33:57,943 --> 00:34:01,023
我所知道的是，你们的马车还在那里
Your wagon is still there for all I know.

466
00:34:01,053 --> 00:34:03,773
撒谎。割了她的喉咙
Lies. Cut her.

467
00:34:06,013 --> 00:34:07,513
快点，把它给我
Come on, give it to me!

468
00:34:07,563 --> 00:34:10,453
来给我亲爱的朋友卢西尔斯造点噪音
Boys, a clamor for my beloved friend Lucius.

469
00:34:13,853 --> 00:34:16,373
怎么看上去这么忧郁？
Why so glum and gloomy?

470
00:34:25,013 --> 00:34:26,123
他是谁？
Who's this then?

471
00:34:26,163 --> 00:34:30,013
尊贵的昆特斯·庞贝阁下，特鲁里亚舰队的指挥官
His noble honor Quintus Pompey, commander of Tyrrhenian fleet.

472
00:34:30,053 --> 00:34:31,543
海王星苦难的根源
Neptune's scourge.

473
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:34,423
哦，海王星苦难的根源
Oh, Neptune's scourge.

474
00:34:34,483 --> 00:34:36,613
他们在寻找一马车的国库黄金
Looking for a wagon of treasury gold.

475
00:34:36,643 --> 00:34:40,373
国库黄金？
Treasury gold?

476
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,623
听上去真令人兴奋
How exciting!

477
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:46,983
别再测试我的耐心，乡巴佬
Do not test my patience, peasant.

478
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,323
快滚吧，笨蛋
You be off now, short ass.

479
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:49,876
别忘了带走这些渣滓
Take these scum with you.

480
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:08,672
我的看法是
The way I see it,

481
00:35:08,722 --> 00:35:11,492
我们把昆特斯丢到台伯河中淹死
we put little Quintus here in the Tiber right off,

482
00:35:11,522 --> 00:35:15,382
然后找辆四轮马车偷偷的去埋金子的地方
get us a wagon, sneak out to where the gold's buried.

483
00:35:15,422 --> 00:35:18,732
把金子挖出来，然后像风一样赶到海岸
Dig it up, ride like Zephyrus for the coast,

484
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:21,902
 趁着第一波潮水去西班牙  我在试着思考
 and get the first tide for Spain.  I'm trying to think.

485
00:35:21,932 --> 00:35:25,172
 那样做有什么不好？  怎么不好？
 What was wrong with that?  What's wrong?

486
00:35:25,212 --> 00:35:27,802
即使我不荒谬到
Even if it were not a monstrous sin

487
00:35:27,842 --> 00:35:29,992
去偷罗马的神圣财产…
to steal sacred property of Rome...

488
00:35:30,032 --> 00:35:31,852
 我不是不知道么，是不是？
I wasn't to know, was l?

489
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:34,159
 …然后躺在担架上穿越大街
...you then ride through the streets on a litter,

490
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:37,622
不停的叫喊，唱歌，广播你的偷盗行为
shouting and singing and broadcasting your theft

491
00:35:37,662 --> 00:35:39,472
给所有的人知道
to all and sundry.

492
00:35:39,502 --> 00:35:42,752
到明天日出的时候，所有的罗马人都会知道 你做了什么，还有你在哪里
By sunrise, everyone in Rome will know what you did and where you are.

493
00:35:42,782 --> 00:35:45,152
就在这里，我的房子里
Here, in my house.

494
00:35:48,082 --> 00:35:49,172
那我们该怎么办？
So what's to be done then?

495
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:52,205
你必须把金子交出去
You will have to give it back.

496
00:35:52,882 --> 00:35:54,612
如果你现在直接去找凯撒
If you go direct to Caesar now,

497
00:35:54,662 --> 00:35:58,312
把庞贝的儿子作为甜点带给他 他可能会对你额外开恩
bring him Pompey's son as a sweetener, he might show mercy.

498
00:35:58,352 --> 00:36:00,622
交出去？ 我不这么认为
Give it back? I don't think so.

499
00:36:00,672 --> 00:36:03,342
这不是建议 这是命令
That's not advice. That's an order.

500
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:05,741
我来和你分享神送来的礼物…
Here's me come to share a god-sent gift--

501
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:07,341
命令！
An order!

502
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:09,661
真该死！ 我的家被人入侵了
Damn you. My home was invaded

503
00:36:09,691 --> 00:36:13,421
因为你，我妻子差点被杀掉
and my wife near killed on your account.

504
00:36:16,811 --> 00:36:18,461
好吧
All right.

505
00:36:18,521 --> 00:36:20,791
好吧
All right.

506
00:36:21,941 --> 00:36:23,321
你会和我一起去，是吧？
But you'll come with me though, eh?

507
00:36:23,361 --> 00:36:27,611
这是你自己搞出来的乱子 你自己去处理
This is your mess. You get yourself out of it.

508
00:36:28,401 --> 00:36:30,361
那好吧
Fine then.

509
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,431
我这就去
I'll be off then.

510
00:36:39,101 --> 00:36:41,151
祝你好运，长官
Good luck to you, sir.

511
00:36:59,531 --> 00:37:02,951
原谅我，我很快就回来
Forgive me. I will try to return swiftly.

512
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:07,551
对不起，亲爱的
Excuse me, my dear.

513
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,940
波罗，你这个无赖
Pullo, you scoundrel.

514
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,820
你这次做了什么？
What have you done now?

515
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:34,360
尊贵的阁下…
Your honor, uh...

516
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,690
 卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯说我应该来找你…
Lucius vorenus said I should come to you and--

517
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,085
士兵，别急
Easy, soldier.

518
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,810
这个是谁？
Who is this?

519
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,930
庞贝的儿子，昆特斯
Quintus, son of Pompey.

520
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,680
还真是的！
So it is!

521
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,970
昆特斯，我的老伙伴
Quintus, my old cock,

522
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,560
看到你这样我可真开心
how good to see you so.

523
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,330
解释吧
Explain.

524
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,630
好，是这样的，阁下
Well, it's like this, your honor.

525
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,540
他来找他们的金子
He, this one come to find the gold.

526
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,900
什么金子？
What gold?

527
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,970
是庞贝的手下从国库偷走的金子
The gold that Pompey's boys stole from the treasury, sir.

528
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,490
庞贝没有得到金子？
Pompey does not have it?

529
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,380
他没有，阁下
He doesn't, sir.

530
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,190
现在请恕我对您的不尊敬
Now I meant no disrespect,

531
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,750
如果我知道金子是来自于国库的话
and had I known the gold was from the treasury,

532
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:28,360
我宁可不去碰它 但是当时这个女孩在…
I'd not have touched it. But there was this girl here, sir--

533
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:31,570
别管这个女孩了 挑重点说
Never mind the girl. Speak to the point.

534
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,260
金子在哪儿？
Where is the gold?

535
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,579
它非常安全，阁下
It's all safe, sir.

536
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:40,519
我把它埋到树林里去了
I buried it deep in the woods

537
00:38:40,549 --> 00:38:43,709
从弗拉米尼亚斯大门出去几里远
a couple miles from the Flaminian gate.

538
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:49,249
感谢上天
Thank you.

539
00:39:23,309 --> 00:39:25,159
你会为此付出代价的
You will pay for this!

540
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,959
 显然你能做的更棒  先放过他
 Surely you can do better than that.  Leave him be.

541
00:39:29,129 --> 00:39:30,849
很抱歉我们这样见面，昆特斯
I'm sorry we meet like this, Quintus.

542
00:39:30,889 --> 00:39:34,639
我对你的父亲和家庭都无比的尊敬
I have only deep respect for your father and his family.

543
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,029
去死吧，你们这些狗杂种
Kiss my ass, you traitorous dog.

544
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:41,089
他真是个傲慢的小家伙呢，是不是？
Elegant little fellow, isn't he?

545
00:39:41,469 --> 00:39:44,239
你不需要害怕 你的生命还属于你自己
You need not fear. Your life is yours still.

546
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,029
我把你送回给你父亲
I'm sending you back to your father

547
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:49,289
 还有一份停战协议  停战协议
 with an offer of truce.  A truce?

548
00:39:49,339 --> 00:39:50,469
安静
Quiet.

549
00:39:50,529 --> 00:39:52,218
你疯了吗？
Are you run mad?

550
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:55,020
When we have them on their backs in the sand?

551
00:39:55,628 --> 00:39:58,348
安静
Be quiet.

552
00:39:59,128 --> 00:40:03,308
一个基于很好条件的停战协议
An offer of equable truce on good terms.

553
00:40:03,348 --> 00:40:04,668
如果暴力继续的话
If violence continues,

554
00:40:04,698 --> 00:40:09,328
这将不是我，而是你父亲 和他的盟友们的所作所为
it will not be my doing, but that of your father and his allies.

555
00:40:09,378 --> 00:40:12,198
我父亲不需要停战协议
My father needs no truce.

556
00:40:12,268 --> 00:40:15,518
再过两个满月就能看到 你被钉死在议事大厅里
Two full moons will see you on a spike in the Forum.

557
00:40:15,568 --> 00:40:19,698
 你这可怜虫  把他抬到马上去
 You wretch!  Put him on a horse.

558
00:40:26,578 --> 00:40:29,298
你这个淘气的女人
You naughty woman.

559
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:34,808
从来告诉我凯撒对你还有这份热情
Never told me Caesar had such a passion for you.

560
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,358
不是这样的
Not so.

561
00:40:37,408 --> 00:40:40,518
我看到他看你的眼神了
I saw the way he looked at you.

562
00:40:40,768 --> 00:40:44,398
就像公牛看到了欧罗巴
Like the bull that tupped Europa.

563
00:40:45,198 --> 00:40:47,658
我不能责怪他
I can't blame him.

564
00:40:47,748 --> 00:40:49,918
这么的…
Such...

565
00:40:50,928 --> 00:40:53,148
美丽
beauty.

566
00:40:54,448 --> 00:40:56,468
这样的美
Such beauty.

567
00:40:58,798 --> 00:41:00,828
太友善了
Too kind.

568
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:03,268
太过友善了
Far too kind.

569
00:41:04,138 --> 00:41:07,137
凯撒对我没有偏好
Caesar has no inclination to me.

570
00:41:07,187 --> 00:41:09,777
我对他也一样
Nor I to him.

571
00:41:10,997 --> 00:41:13,617
还这么的谦虚
And such modesty.

572
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:18,817
卡尔普蕊娜，她是不是很漂亮？
Is she not beautiful, Calpurnia?

573
00:41:18,957 --> 00:41:20,467
而且一点都不淫荡
She has none of the goatishness

574
00:41:20,527 --> 00:41:23,627
通常她这个年纪的女人都会有的
one normally sees in women her age.

575
00:41:23,847 --> 00:41:26,387
可能她喝了什么秘密药水了吧
She has some secret potion perhaps.

576
00:41:26,447 --> 00:41:29,417
我觉得你有点轻佻了
You are attempting levity, I believe.

577
00:41:29,637 --> 00:41:33,057
很抱歉如果我不能再纵容这样的谈话
Forgive me if I do not indulge in such talk.

578
00:41:40,867 --> 00:41:43,967
你肯定会后悔让他逃命的
You're sure to regret letting that one live.

579
00:41:44,017 --> 00:41:46,087
He has a malevolent spirit.

580
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:49,766
再我完成之前还会有很多亡灵的
There's many left undead I'll regret before I'm done.

581
00:41:51,897 --> 00:41:55,367
带上波罗去找金子吧
Take Pullo and retrieve the gold.

582
00:41:55,437 --> 00:41:57,827
军团士兵波罗
Legionary Pullo.

583
00:42:01,507 --> 00:42:03,397
你是个小偷
You are a thief.

584
00:42:03,447 --> 00:42:06,237
一个愚蠢的，不合格的小偷
A foolish, incompetent thief.

585
00:42:06,287 --> 00:42:08,547
但是你以前的服役很不错
But you have served us well in the past.

586
00:42:08,587 --> 00:42:11,657
所以我们嫁妆你的愚蠢是诚实的表现
So we will pretend your foolishness is a species of honesty,

587
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:14,697
并且判定你无罪
and let you go unpunished.

588
00:42:15,137 --> 00:42:18,607
事实上，我们会给你点小小的奖励
In fact, I think we shall reward you.

589
00:42:18,657 --> 00:42:20,907
我不想为了财富而争论不休
I do not like to quarrel with Fortune,

590
00:42:20,967 --> 00:42:23,646
显然你已经是她的宠物了
and clearly she's taken you for a pet.

591
00:42:23,696 --> 00:42:27,256
当你找到埋藏地点的时候 给他一百个金币
When you find the trove, give him 100 gold pieces.

592
00:42:27,306 --> 00:42:29,246
谢谢，阁下
Thank you, sir.

593
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:31,656
如你所愿
As you wish.

594
00:42:36,996 --> 00:42:39,776
对了，安东尼，不要对我的判断产生疑问
By the by, Antony, never question my judgment

595
00:42:39,806 --> 00:42:42,536
特别是在我们的敌人面前
in the presence of our enemies.

596
00:42:42,886 --> 00:42:46,336
你的记忆力很好，所以你将会记得
You have a good memory, so you will remember that.

597
00:42:46,456 --> 00:42:49,766
 我会的  解散
 I will remember.  Dismissed.

598
00:42:51,076 --> 00:42:53,156
士兵，马！
Men, horses!

599
00:42:53,226 --> 00:42:55,986
 快点！  出发！
 Quick about it!  Forward!

600
00:43:00,616 --> 00:43:02,796
你为什么皱眉头，小猫头鹰？
Why do you frown, little owl?

601
00:43:02,836 --> 00:43:04,736
马克·安东尼说的很有道理
Marc Antony speaks sense.

602
00:43:04,776 --> 00:43:07,576
战略上讲停战协议不是非常的合适
Truce now does not seem tactically correct.

603
00:43:08,176 --> 00:43:09,706
这要看具体条件
Depends on terms.

604
00:43:11,526 --> 00:43:13,866
你给庞贝了根本接受不了的条件
You offer terms that Pompey cannot accept

605
00:43:14,046 --> 00:43:16,206
但是西赛罗和元老院能接受
but Cicero and the Senate can.

606
00:43:16,246 --> 00:43:18,016
真机灵
Swift--

607
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,136
等等，有人在看着呢
Hold up, dominus, there's people watching.

608
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:26,496
把我们带到没有人去的地方
Sir, take us somewhere none can see us.

609
00:43:36,236 --> 00:43:38,355
他怎么了？ 他被下毒了吗？
What's in him? Is he poisoned?

610
00:43:38,395 --> 00:43:41,195
他有疾病，过一会儿就会好的
He has the Morbus Comitialis. It will pass in a moment.

611
00:43:41,235 --> 00:43:43,765
快，关上门
Please, dominus, shut the door.

612
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,909
Should we not fetch a doctor?

613
00:43:48,955 --> 00:43:51,935
不会吧
We should not.

614
00:43:51,995 --> 00:43:55,195
无论发生什么，都不能让人知道他的痛苦
At all costs, he cannot have his affliction known.

615
00:43:55,235 --> 00:43:56,635
没有人会跟随一个
No one will follow a man

616
00:43:56,675 --> 00:44:00,545
被太阳神诅咒了疾病的人的
whom Apollo has cursed with the Morbus.

617
00:44:54,694 --> 00:44:59,174
向天起誓，你不会向任何人说起这件事
vow to Orcus, never speak of this.

618
00:45:35,994 --> 00:45:38,324
你没事吧，丈夫？
Are you quite well, husband?

619
00:45:38,514 --> 00:45:40,934
没什么
Nothing serious.

620
00:45:41,424 --> 00:45:43,044
来
Come.

621
00:45:45,574 --> 00:45:50,384
阿提娅，我觉得很累了 我想我们该离开了
Atia, I'm growing tired. I think we shall leave you.

622
00:45:51,314 --> 00:45:52,874
哦，好的
OH, well

623
00:45:52,924 --> 00:45:57,444
 当然，如你所愿  晚安，亲爱的
 As you wish, of course.  Good night, my dear.

624
00:46:03,664 --> 00:46:05,914
你晚上过的愉快吗？
Did you have a pleasant evening?

625
00:46:05,964 --> 00:46:07,684
是的
I did.

626
00:46:07,734 --> 00:46:10,393
你的侄女阿提娅真是太客气了
Your niece Atia is most polite,

627
00:46:10,423 --> 00:46:14,393
首席占卜师作了很多关于宗教的评论
and the Chief Augur made many edifying remarks on religion.

628
00:46:14,453 --> 00:46:18,123
抱歉我不能和你马上一起回家
I regret I will not be coming home with you immediately.

629
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:19,608
But you're not well.

630
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:21,611
Really, I am quite recovered.

631
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:24,580
I have urgent business with my marsupial clerks.

632
00:46:25,013 --> 00:46:28,743
晚上还有公务？ 这不是很恰当
Business at night? It is not proper.

633
00:46:28,773 --> 00:46:31,803
不恰当，但是必须的 我必须准备好离开这个城市
Not proper, but necessary. I have to be ready to leave the city

634
00:46:31,853 --> 00:46:35,813
一旦庞贝拒绝和和约 马上就要开始追击他
and pursue Pompey as soon as he refuses truce.

635
00:46:35,853 --> 00:46:38,013
他会拒绝吗？
He will refuse?

636
00:46:38,413 --> 00:46:40,783
我认为是这样的
I believe so.

637
00:47:56,312 --> 00:47:58,422
母亲，怎么了？
What's wrong, Mother?

638
00:48:12,542 --> 00:48:14,332
我很孤单
I'm alone.

639
00:48:14,412 --> 00:48:16,752
我孤单一人
I'm all alone.

640
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:24,101
 他说什么？  荒谬！
 What does he say?  Ridiculous!

641
00:49:24,151 --> 00:49:25,601
 他说什么？  没什么
 What does he say?  Nothing.

642
00:49:25,631 --> 00:49:28,011
不值得重复
Nothing worth repeating.

643
00:49:31,711 --> 00:49:33,381
但是他提出停战了？
But he offers a truce.

644
00:49:33,441 --> 00:49:34,401
什么条件？
On what terms?

645
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,511
和那个渣滓停战？ 你是女人？
Truce with that scum? Are you women?

646
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,351
我要让他们被狗强奸
I'll have them raped by dogs!

647
00:49:39,381 --> 00:49:41,401
安静 出去！
Silence. Get out!

648
00:49:41,451 --> 00:49:43,441
原谅他吧 他被凌辱了
Excuse him. He's been ill-used.

649
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:45,739
但他是对的，我们不会停战
But he is right. There can be no truce.

650
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:47,291
当然不
Of course not.

651
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:50,327
但是凯撒没有要求很多
But Caesar does not ask for so much.

652
00:49:50,351 --> 00:49:54,630
 法律豁免权，共同裁军  我必须放下武器？我？
 Legal immunity. Mutual disarmament.  I must disarm? I?

653
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:57,980
我是罗马合法的执政官 他是个罪犯
I am lawful Consul of Rome. He is a criminal.

654
00:49:58,010 --> 00:49:59,320
没有什么是共同的
There is nothing mutual in it.

655
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:01,920
他可能是个罪犯，但是他拥有整个城市
He may be a criminal, but he has the city.

656
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,040
 我们必须解决这些问题  事实是，他是个叛徒
 We must deal with facts.  Fact is, he is a traitor!

657
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,150
让我们公平的说吧
Let us be fair.

658
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:12,040
执政官，他已经是非常的友善了
Consul, he has been remarkably peaceable.

659
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:15,460
他既没有杀害你的盟友也没有入侵你的家产
He has not killed your allies or violated your property.

660
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:18,440
我们必须认真地对待这份提议
We should look on this offer seriously.

661
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,440
你难道没看见他的阴谋吗？
Do you not see his stratagem?

662
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:22,390
他是要分裂我们
He is trying to drive a wedge between us.

663
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:26,470
 停战协议至少能为我们赢得时间  昆特斯说的很对
 A truce would buy us time at least.  Quintus is right!

664
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:28,890
你们真是女人！
You are women!

665
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:32,320
傻瓜
Fools.

666
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,700
告诉我你爱他
Tell me you love him.

667
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,600
告诉我然后我就会离开
Tell me that and I will go away,

668
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,450
我永远不会再回来
and I will never come back.

669
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,140
我爱他
I love him.

670
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,070
看在我的孩子们的灵魂上， 我爱他
On the souls of my children, I love him.

671
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:09,120
泰特斯·波罗！真是令人高兴
Titus Pullo, what joy!

672
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,959
 他们最终绕了你？  是的
 They let you go alive then?  They did.

673
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:13,749
乌瑞纳斯在哪儿？
Where's vorenus?

674
00:51:13,819 --> 00:51:16,909
他去了门神神殿补过忏悔了
He's gone to make amends at the shrine of Janus.

675
00:51:17,799 --> 00:51:22,369
你认识伊万德·普契洛吗？ 我姐姐的丈夫
You know Evander Pulchio, my brother-in-law, my sister's husband.

676
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,459
伊万德
Evander, you say?

677
00:51:27,499 --> 00:51:29,879
祝你健康，士兵
Good health, soldier.

678
00:51:30,809 --> 00:51:32,889
你也一样
And you.

679
00:51:34,849 --> 00:51:36,319
喝点水吗？
Will you take water?

680
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:39,619
 好的  你先坐
 I will.  Sit you down.

681
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:57,119
朱庇特主神给了我们征兆

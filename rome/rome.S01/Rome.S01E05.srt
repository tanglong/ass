1
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,154
我的挚友
"My dear friend Gaius,

2
00:02:01,564 --> 00:02:02,864
盖乌斯

3
00:02:03,735 --> 00:02:06,255
我们之间怎么会出现
how are we come

4
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:08,806
这么荒谬的情况呢？
to this absurd position?

5
00:02:09,406 --> 00:02:15,007
为了和平与公道
In the interests of peace and equity,

6
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:17,707
我接受 元老院和罗马的人民
 I accept--"  The Senate and People of Rome

7
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,297
授权我接受
have authorized me to accept.

8
00:02:21,338 --> 00:02:23,939
元老院和罗马的人民
"...the Senate and People of Rome

9
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:26,740
已经授权我接受休战…
have authorized me to accept a truce--"

10
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,880
不，不能说休战，那会暗示
No, not truce. That would imply

11
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,621
他是君主而不是罪人
that he is a sovereign rather than a criminal entity.

12
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:32,731
对啊
Quite right. A criminal.

13
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:34,932
罪人

14
00:02:34,932 --> 00:02:37,252
已经授权我接受
"...have authorized me to accept

15
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,483
停止敌对状态的建议
a cessation of hostilities...

16
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:45,454
在你上一封信所提出的条件之下
on the terms offered in your last letter.

17
00:02:45,484 --> 00:02:47,644
我会等待你的回复
I await your answer."

18
00:02:47,654 --> 00:02:49,785
 够好了吧  够好了？
 Good enough.  Good enough?

19
00:02:49,785 --> 00:02:52,816
这种卑鄙的羞辱也能说好吗？
This abject humiliation is good enough?

20
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:56,326
我们不能称为人，我们简直就是虫子
We are not men. We are worms.

21
00:02:56,326 --> 00:02:58,187
虫子太难听了
Worms is harsh.

22
00:02:58,197 --> 00:03:01,408
虫子可没有我们跑得快
Worms cannot run away as speedily as we do.

23
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:04,058
恺撒甚至还没有离开罗马
Caesar has not even left Rome,

24
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:05,889
老天才知道为什么
Gods know why not,

25
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,829
可是他的军团追击我们
yet his legions chase us

26
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,790
毫不费力的从这个城镇追到那个城镇
from town to town with great ease.

27
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,591
与其说是虫子不如说我们是一群绵羊
We're more like sheep than worms.

28
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,761
要是我们还有税收，要是我们还有钱供养军队
If our levies had not failed, if we had money to pay troops--

29
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:20,632
是啊，他们有，我们却没有
Yes, but they have and we don't.

30
00:03:20,632 --> 00:03:22,842
让我们坚守现在仅存的硕果吧，庞贝，
Let us cleave to the matter at hand. Pompey, you must give

31
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:26,363
你应该找个时间单独和他会晤
some notion of when you will agree to meet him in person.

32
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:26,913
不可能
 Never.  There is no reason for them to meet.

33
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:28,514
他们没有理由会晤

34
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:30,464
纷争是在恺撒和元老院之间
The dispute is between Caesar and the Senate.

35
00:03:30,464 --> 00:03:32,295
这才是正式的途径
 It is the proper form.  I'll not meet the man.

36
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:34,275
我不会去见他的，决不，
Never. Like a son, he was to me.

37
00:03:34,335 --> 00:03:36,706
他对我来说就像是我的儿子

38
00:03:36,706 --> 00:03:38,866
他像你什么毫不重要
What he was like to you is immaterial.

39
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:41,067
出于朱庇特神的怜悯
It is only by Jupiter's mercy

40
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:44,107
他才没有把我们的头串在长矛上面
that he has not already put our heads on pikes.

41
00:03:44,107 --> 00:03:45,037
怜悯？
Mercy? Jupiter has no mercy for cowards.

42
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:47,168
朱庇特神可不会怜悯懦夫

43
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:50,479
 你说话小心点  你要讨论接受或者反对投降？
 Cato, be careful.  You'll accept abject surrender--

44
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,679
这不是投降！
This is not surrender!

45
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,490
庞贝·马格纳斯不会投降
Pompey Magnus does not surrender.

46
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:03,242
我需要时间
I need time.

47
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:06,562
休战会为我们争取那些时间
A truce gains us that time.

48
00:04:22,516 --> 00:04:25,417
法拉斯·霍塔送来三罐琥珀
verrus Horta sends three jars of amber

49
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:28,117
还告诉我们他已经脱离了庞贝的阵营
and informs us he has left the standard of Pompey.

50
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:31,218
并且请求在您的庇护下继续生活
He entrusts his living to your abundant mercy.

51
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:34,459
 霍塔？ 就是那个白白的皮肤，红红的头发…
 Horta?  Pederast, waxy skin, red hair,

52
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:37,189
住在塔斯库勒姆，我认识他，是个可怜虫
 estates in Tusculum.  I have him, the wretch.

53
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:40,190
给他送去一小袋钱
Send a small bag of money with a fulsome letter

54
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,030
让他当个财务官什么的好了
and make him a Quaestor or something.

55
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,731
要是对每个遗弃庞贝的人都给这种恩惠的话
Show such mercy to every man that deserts Pompey,

56
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:47,792
你会变成穷光蛋的，这种人每天都来上好几打
you will pauperize yourself. There's dozens of them coming every day.

57
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:50,962
善用恩惠能给你换来1万兵力
Judicious use of mercy is worth 10,000 men.

58
00:04:50,962 --> 00:04:54,463
要是花光我口袋里面的钱能给我买个王位的话，那也值得
And if my last coin buys me a throne, it's a fair price.

59
00:04:54,463 --> 00:04:57,234
 王位？ 这是诗的破格，还能是什么呢？
 A throne?  Poetic license. What else?

60
00:04:57,234 --> 00:04:59,164
阿提娅邀请您用晚餐
Atia invites you to dinner tonight.

61
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:01,575
又来了？老天
Again? Bona Dea.

62
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:06,266
 今天晚上不行  我得给个什么理由呢？
 Not tonight in any case.  What excuse shall I give?

63
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:07,056
什么都不用解释
 None.  This is the second time

64
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,637
这可是您第二次拒绝她的邀请了
you have refused an invitation from her.

65
00:05:09,737 --> 00:05:11,707
我不需要向阿提娅说明什么
I need not account for myself to Atia.

66
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:16,138
如您所说，也许这不是一个聪明的选择，不过的确很勇敢
As you say. Not a sapient choice, perhaps; but brave, sure.

67
00:05:16,138 --> 00:05:19,509
人们说奴隶谈勇敢就如鱼想飞翔一样不切实际
They say slaves talk of bravery as fish talk of flying.

68
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:22,249
他们这么说吗？真够幽默的
They say that, do they? How very witty of them.

69
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,910
为了寻求正义与和平
"Seeking only justice and peace

70
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,081
避免无谓的流血事件在罗马发生
and to avoid the unnecessary shedding of Roman blood,

71
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:35,212
盖乌斯·朱利叶斯·恺撒公开恳求
Gaius Julius Caesar has publicly implored

72
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:37,783
背叛者庞贝·马格纳斯
the renegade Gnaius Pompey Magnus

73
00:05:37,783 --> 00:05:41,204
接受休战并且放下武器
to accept truce and lay down his arms."

74
00:05:43,614 --> 00:05:45,695
你们在干什么？
What are you doing?

75
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:48,815
这个挺有意思的，就像是艺术
It's rather fun, and there's quite an art to it.

76
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,566
这个古怪的孩子
Strange boy.

77
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,717
我刚刚听到奇怪事情
I have just heard a very strange tale

78
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:56,487
从厨房工人那里听来关于你的
about you from the kitchen staff.

79
00:05:56,587 --> 00:05:58,458
我真是很想知道
For what possible reason I wonder,

80
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,888
你和恺撒偷偷躲在厨房里面干什么
would you and Caesar be skulking about in a cupboard?

81
00:06:00,898 --> 00:06:01,998
什么？
What? We were- it was nothing.

82
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,009
我们…没什么

83
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:06,089
没什么？听起来不像嘛
Nothing? It doesn't sound like nothing.

84
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:09,020
你在勾引他？你个狡猾的小狐狸
You seduced him, you sly little fox.

85
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:09,880
我没有
 I did not.  I am not clear it is decent,

86
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,161
我不知道这正不正当
him being your great uncle, but who's to say what's

87
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:13,301
他可是你的舅公哦，谁能说呢？
decent in times like these? In any case, well done.

88
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:14,991
这年头，什么东西才是正当？

89
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:17,492
不管怎么样，干得好

90
00:06:17,492 --> 00:06:20,993
让我们看看赛维莉亚和你这个小男孩竞争
Let's see Servilia compete with a soft young boy like you.

91
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:23,213
我们真是能干啊
 What power we shall wield.  You have it wrong.

92
00:06:23,223 --> 00:06:24,834
你想错了
A good lover is a discreet lover.

93
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:27,434
好的情人一定是个谨慎的情人

94
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:29,865
他那时候不舒服，我只不过在照料他，仅此而已
He was taken ill. I was helping him to recover, that's all.

95
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:30,935
当然是了，我的小可爱，
Of course he was, my dove. Now in the future you must not appear too eager.

96
00:06:30,965 --> 00:06:32,995
不过日后你不能表现得太饥渴

97
00:06:32,995 --> 00:06:35,066
男人们就是喜欢难弄到手的东西
A man likes it if you play hard to get.

98
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:36,406
你不要烦他了，妈妈
 Why don't you leave him alone, mother?  Now, I have invited

99
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:39,537
我已经邀请了恺撒和马克·安东尼过来吃晚餐
Caesar and Mark Antony for dinner tonight.

100
00:06:39,637 --> 00:06:40,637
我们会保证你看起来
We'll be sure you look especially handsome--

101
00:06:40,637 --> 00:06:42,598
特别帅气  我不是他的情人！
I am not his lover!

102
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,778
别对我撒谎
Do not lie to me.

103
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:47,239
 你知道你撒谎我会看出来的  我没有
 You know I detest it.  I am not lying.

104
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:49,409
他有时候会很痛苦，非常痛苦
He has an affliction. A terrible affliction.

105
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,780
痛苦？什么痛苦？谁弄的？
Affliction? What affliction? By whom?

106
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,310
我…我不会再说了，我立过誓
I- I will speak no more of it. I swore an oath.

107
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,241
去他的誓言，我可是你妈妈，告诉我
Oath be damned! I am your mother. Tell me.

108
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:59,201
原谅我，我不能说
Excuse me. I will not.

109
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,683
真是让人失望
Well, that's very disappointing.

110
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:16,485
恺撒派人来说他不会来赴宴了
Caesar sends to say he cannot come this evening.

111
00:07:16,585 --> 00:07:17,556
无所谓了
No matter.

112
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:21,406
为什么不来？
 Why not?  He doesn't say.

113
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:23,057
他没说

114
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:45,152
泰特斯·波罗又睡在楼梯上了
Titus Pullo is sleeping on the stairs again.

115
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:48,563
 他就不能去别的地方？ 他不会在罗马呆太长时间的
 Has he nowhere else to go?  He won't be in Rome much longer.

116
00:07:48,963 --> 00:07:53,514
告诉我，那个年轻人什么时候回来？你的丈夫
Tell me, when is the youth returning? Your husband.

117
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:54,664
 克理图  克理图，
 Crito.  When does he return from his droving?

118
00:07:54,664 --> 00:07:56,604
他什么时候能卖完牲口回来？

119
00:07:56,604 --> 00:07:59,305
 十一月，为什么？ 我今天要把奴隶卖了
 November. Why?  I'm selling my slaves today.

120
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:01,465
那就会有钱给你买嫁妆了
There'll be money enough spare for your dowry.

121
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:04,236
他一回来，你和卢休斯就可以到他那里
So when Crito comes home, you and Lucius can go to him

122
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:05,806
好好的过你们小日子
 and start your married life proper.  Thank you, Father!

123
00:08:05,806 --> 00:08:07,437
 谢谢你，爸爸 谢谢，
 Thank you.  We'll be sorry to see you go.

124
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:08,807
我们看到你要走真是不舍得
November? It's so soon.

125
00:08:08,807 --> 00:08:10,337
十一月？太快了
 They have to go at some time.  Of course, of course,

126
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:11,658
-他们没过一段时间就得走了

127
00:08:11,878 --> 00:08:14,118
-是的，没错 可是十一月  -我知道这很难，
 but November.  It's hard, but it has to be done.

128
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:15,359
但是早晚总得这么做
They'll be so far away. You know how these drovers live.

129
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,209
他们要去很远，你知道这种牲畜贩子怎么生活

130
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:20,610
但是妈妈，我要去，我要和我的丈夫在一起
But Mama, I want to go. I want to be with my husband.

131
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,310
我知道，我知道，当然了
I know. I know. Of course.

132
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,011
你必须得走
You must go.

133
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:26,251
就是太难了
It's just hard.

134
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:29,722
早上好
Morning.

135
00:08:30,582 --> 00:08:32,783
麻烦讨口水喝？
Trouble you for some water?

136
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:34,183
坐吧
Sit down.

137
00:08:36,113 --> 00:08:37,874
你应该呆在军营里
 You should be in camp.  Nothing to do there.

138
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,604
 在那里无所事事 -真是无聊
 It's boring.  Take some bread.

139
00:08:41,084 --> 00:08:42,465
吃点面包
I'll not, thanks.

140
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:43,675
不用了，谢谢

141
00:08:44,455 --> 00:08:46,556
我觉得不是很舒服
I'm not feeling too well.

142
00:08:46,786 --> 00:08:48,716
你喝太多了
You're drinking too much.

143
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:51,887
没有，不是那样的
No, it's not that.

144
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:54,918
我吃了腐烂的牡蛎
I ate some depraved oysters.

145
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:56,508
你的女人呢？
 Where's your girl?  Girl?

146
00:08:56,898 --> 00:08:58,208
女人？

147
00:09:01,189 --> 00:09:02,659
糟了！
Cac!

148
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:10,861
我知道就在这里面，我知道的
I know it's one of these. I know it!

149
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:12,482
别担心了
Stop worrying.

150
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:14,732
就算找不到了，你还可以在找另一个嘛
Even if we can't find her, you can get another.

151
00:09:15,832 --> 00:09:17,203
我不要另一个
I don't want another. I want Eirene.

152
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:18,713
我要爱琳妮
You'll be off south after Pompey before long.

153
00:09:18,753 --> 00:09:20,703
你不用多久就得南征去打庞贝了

154
00:09:20,703 --> 00:09:22,164
不可能带着她上路的
You can't take her soldiering.

155
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:24,264
可能我就不归队了
Maybe I won't go back to camp.

156
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,265
反正我的服役时间也差不多了
My time is nearly done anyway.

157
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,825
离开第13军团？为什么？
Leave the 13th? Why?

158
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:31,986
 你不就走了吗？ 你又不是我
 You did.  You are not me.

159
00:09:32,036 --> 00:09:33,506
你没有和平的天分
You have no talent for peace.

160
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,837
我不能扔下她不管
I can't just leave her.

161
00:09:36,037 --> 00:09:37,697
你就只会用老二思考
 You think with your penis.  It's not like that.

162
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:38,797
不是那样的
 I've not touched her.  Then what purpose does she serve?

163
00:09:39,308 --> 00:09:41,778
 我碰都没碰过她  那你要她干嘛？

164
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:44,759
我喜欢看着她，能让我感到平静
I just like to look at her. Makes me calm.

165
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,020
她在那里呢
Here she is.

166
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:53,961
感谢你，阿波罗神
Thank you, Apollo.

167
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:56,792
那个女孩儿是他的
The girl is his.

168
00:09:58,382 --> 00:10:00,552
别找麻烦，欠债还钱
No trouble. Pay what's owed,

169
00:10:00,552 --> 00:10:03,383
 女孩儿你就可以带走了  欠债？
 and the girl is all yours.  What's owed?

170
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:06,394
给我吃了那些垃圾你该给我钱才对
You should be paying me to drink the pond filth you serve here.

171
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:09,054
波罗！
Pullo!

172
00:10:11,715 --> 00:10:12,695
多少钱？
How much?

173
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:18,707
我一有钱就马上还你
I'll pay you back soon as I can.

174
00:10:18,957 --> 00:10:19,867
好吧，
Do that.

175
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:22,667
不过你要拿她怎么办？
So what will you do with her?

176
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,439
我不要她呆在这里
 I don't want her.  Say again?

177
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:31,519
再说一次？
I don't want her. It's nice of you to think of it--

178
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,790
我不要她，你们想得倒是好…

179
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,730
你不是要个奴隶吗？一直都想要的
But you want a slave. You keep asking for one,

180
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,161
这就给你带了一个来，波罗没法安置她，我们又不用花钱
and here she is. Pullo can't keep her, and it costs us nothing.

181
00:10:38,161 --> 00:10:39,591
我就不能要一个你的高卢奴隶？
Can't I have one of your Gaulish slaves?

182
00:10:39,591 --> 00:10:41,792
我跟你说过，我的高卢奴隶还没驯化呢
I've told you, my Gauls are unseasoned.

183
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:43,582
擦完地板就会把你的喉咙给割了
Cut your throat as soon as sweep your floor.

184
00:10:43,582 --> 00:10:45,223
这个受过训练，又干净又听话
This one's trained up nice and docile.

185
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:46,313
她有什么不好的？
What is wrong with her?

186
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:51,484
她的眼神很奇怪
 She has strange eyes.  You drive me insane!

187
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:53,014
你快让我疯了

188
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:55,755
女孩儿留下来
The girl stays.

189
00:11:04,577 --> 00:11:07,738
冷静点，宝贝，冷静点
Keep calm, sweetie. Keep calm.

190
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:09,218
我怎么能冷静，波罗
How can I be calm when Pullo's put that little witch to spy on me?

191
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:10,858
把那个小贱人留下来监视我

192
00:11:10,978 --> 00:11:13,009
他知道了，莉莎，他知道了
He knows, Rissa, he knows.

193
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:14,709
就他那样的傻大个儿？
Big simple brute like that?

194
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:16,610
就算他怀疑什么事情
If he even suspected anything,

195
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,180
他肯定会马上告诉乌瑞纳斯的，不是吗？
he'd go straight to vorenus and tell him, wouldn't he?

196
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,911
你真的这么想？
 Course he would.  You really think?

197
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:23,711
 他什么都不知道  真的？
 He doesn't know nothing.  Really?

198
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:27,282
当然了。他看到伊万达在你的房子里
Sure of it. So he saw Evander round your house.

199
00:11:27,282 --> 00:11:29,383
那又怎么样？他是你的家人，当然可以进来
So what? He's family. He's allowed.

200
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:32,453
 那倒是  你不用担心的
 That's true.  You're getting worried over nothing.

201
00:11:34,414 --> 00:11:36,354
上帝，希望如此吧
Gods, let it be so.

202
00:11:36,554 --> 00:11:38,835
那个可怜虫把你要的都给你了
Poor sad wretch gives everything you asked for.

203
00:11:39,485 --> 00:11:42,085
元老院认可你的地位
The Senate will ratify your status,

204
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:44,616
你得到胜利，成为执政官
you get your triumph, stand for consul,

205
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:47,387
而庞贝就撤退到西班牙
and Pompey shall withdraw to Spain.

206
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:49,827
要是我们要求的话估计他还会答应亲波斯卡的小鸡鸡呢
He'll suck Posca's cock if asked nicely.

207
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:51,337
这也太慷慨了吧
Too generous by far. I never thought for an instant

208
00:11:51,337 --> 00:11:54,058
我从未想过要接受这样的条款
 Pompey would accept such terms.  You think it's a stratagem?

209
00:11:54,058 --> 00:11:55,488
你认为这是他的诡计？
I doubt it.

210
00:11:55,658 --> 00:11:56,889
我怀疑

211
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:00,330
他和他的军队都已经被困了
He and what few forces he has are trapped.

212
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,970
他已经弱下来了，而且每天都在败落
He's weak and growing weaker every day.

213
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,361
我们随时都可以让他完蛋
We might crush him at will.

214
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:08,251
不过既然他答应了休战
But now that he has offered truce,

215
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:12,182
如果我再去攻打他，那我就显得是个暴君了
I will look like the worst kind of tyrant if I attack him.

216
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:16,403
波斯卡认为我应该接受休战
Posca here thinks I should accept the truce.

217
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:18,674
 缔造和平  那能够换来什么？
 Make peace.  In exchange for what?

218
00:12:18,744 --> 00:12:20,364
和平本身就是回报
 Peace is it's own reward.  Snivelry.

219
00:12:20,394 --> 00:12:21,864
妇人之仁
The ram has touched the wall. No mercy.

220
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:24,925
撞锤已经贴在城墙外面了，不能仁慈

221
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:27,866
庞贝身边没有军队，但是有元老院
Pompey has no great army, but he has the Senate with him.

222
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:29,236
他带有合法性
 He has legitimacy.  In Rome they are the Senate.

223
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:30,986
他们在罗马才是元老院

224
00:12:31,236 --> 00:12:33,717
走出了城墙他们不过是300个没有用的老头儿
Beyond the walls they are just 300 old men.

225
00:12:33,757 --> 00:12:36,148
你说的有道理，安东尼，但是别人会认同波斯卡的看法，
As you say, Antony, but others will agree with Posca.

226
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:38,638
不过他们已经公开向我投降了
They have made this shameful surrender public.

227
00:12:38,678 --> 00:12:40,769
整个意大利都会知道
It will be read all over ltaly.

228
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:43,709
如果我不是暴君
If I am not a tyrant,

229
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:45,090
如果我要的只是合法性
if I merely seek legitimacy,

230
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,060
为什么不能接受他们的条款呢？
why would I not accept such favorable terms?

231
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:52,651
他拒绝与我们会晤
He refuses to meet us...

232
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:55,252
单独的会晤？
in person?

233
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,214
很好，这个简单
very good. Simple.

234
00:13:02,254 --> 00:13:04,184
民众会明白这么一个理由
Hoi polloi can understand a reason like that.

235
00:13:04,394 --> 00:13:07,015
他拒绝见我
He refuses to meet me face to face.

236
00:13:07,015 --> 00:13:08,195
拒绝面对面地见我
Man to man.

237
00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:11,186
拒绝会晤
He refuses to meet me.

238
00:13:11,386 --> 00:13:13,616
对，就是这个了
Right, that's it.

239
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:15,236
决不休战，
No truce. Let's be after them.

240
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:16,847
我们这就追他
Patience.

241
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,587
耐心点

242
00:13:19,888 --> 00:13:21,528
他跑不了的
He's well caught.

243
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,989
等时机成熟了我们再出发
We'll leave when the time is right.

244
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:29,860
什么时候？
When?

245
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,870
时机成熟之时
When the time is right.

246
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:35,581
我们早就应该离开罗马了
But we should have left Rome long ago.

247
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:37,391
苹果熟了早该摘了
The apple is ripe for the plucking,

248
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:40,042
而我们却呆坐着什么都不干？
and we just sit here doing nothing?

249
00:13:41,662 --> 00:13:43,503
庞贝不是苹果
Pompey is not an apple

250
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:46,664
我也不是农夫
and I am not a farmer.

251
00:13:47,364 --> 00:13:48,914
传守卫
Call for my guard.

252
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:11,669
百夫长卢休斯·乌瑞纳斯
First Spear Centurion Lucius Vorenus.

253
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:13,280
等你回来等了好久
I have been looking for your return.

254
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,740
我退役了，公民
I'm no longer in the army, citizen.

255
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,230
我来把存货给卖了
I've come to sell my stock.

256
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,591
啊，嗯…
Ah,well...

257
00:14:38,865 --> 00:14:41,416
脱水腹泻，我无能为力
Black blood flux. Nothing to be done.

258
00:14:42,136 --> 00:14:43,616
腹泻？
 Flux?  I kept 'em here despite the stink

259
00:14:43,826 --> 00:14:45,577
虽然臭不可当，但是我可是还把他们留着
so you'd know I'd done you nothing dodgy.

260
00:14:45,707 --> 00:14:47,517
所以我没有耍什么花招

261
00:14:48,177 --> 00:14:49,348
也不是谁的错
Nobody to blame.

262
00:14:50,308 --> 00:14:52,829
还好你还剩下一个
Fortune left you one at least.

263
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,579
就是那个幸运的孩子
 Auspicious boy that is.  How much will he fetch?

264
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:57,290
那能换多少钱？

265
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,130
哦，一大笔钱
Oh, a respectable price.

266
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,501
足够把喂养费还了还有剩下的
More than enough to pay the feed bill.

267
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:04,651
喂养费？
 Feed bill?  They didn't starve to death.

268
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:06,102
他们可没有饿死

269
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,333
快走！
Move!

270
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:24,426
什么都没了？
 Nothing?  Not nothing. The boy will fetch

271
00:15:24,426 --> 00:15:25,886
不是一无所有，
 a good price when he's healthy.  What's that?

272
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:27,306
这小孩子健康起来后能卖个好价钱
Your father brought him back from Gaul. What will we do till then?

273
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:29,257
 那是什么？  你爸爸把他从高卢带回来的，

274
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:30,497
在那之前我们能怎么样？
To keep?

275
00:15:30,607 --> 00:15:33,088
 养着他？  等他有点血色我们就把他卖了
We're selling him as soon as he gets some color.

276
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:34,108
那卖了之后呢？
 What will we do after that?  What's his name?

277
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:36,278
 他叫什么名字？ 没有名字
He hasn't got one!

278
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:38,809
我把他叫做卢比奥，那是我死去的鸽子的名字
We'll call him Rubio after my pigeon that died.

279
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:40,439
我们什么都没了
We've nothing saved.

280
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:42,480
别担心，我们会想到有的
Don't worry. I will think of something.

281
00:16:14,127 --> 00:16:16,127
又是这样
And again.

282
00:16:16,137 --> 00:16:17,958
又输了
This is a rout.

283
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,989
我要不要仁慈点呢？
Shall I be merciful?

284
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,790
还是不要
I think not.

285
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,542
你该怎么还我的债呢？
How will you pay your debt?

286
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:45,394
我的就是你的
All that I have is already yours.

287
00:16:46,094 --> 00:16:47,615
还能给你什么呢？
What else can I give you?

288
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:49,825
别再离开我
Don't leave me again.

289
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:51,845
我从没有离开过你
I never left you.

290
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:17,551
人们都无聊疯了
The men are going mad from boredom.

291
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:20,862
今天我不得不割下一个骁勇的战士的双手因为他
Just today I had to cut the hands off a perfectly good Legionary

292
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,931
杀害了一个平民
for murdering a civilian.

293
00:17:23,563 --> 00:17:28,374
接着 又得听一个不知道哪里来的自由民
Then I had to listen to a jumped up freedman

294
00:17:28,384 --> 00:17:29,504
胡说八道了半天
raving for hours

295
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:34,765
说有个百夫长在勾引他的女儿
about one of my centurions seducing his daughters.

296
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:38,446
听起来无聊死了
 It all sounds very tedious.  It is your uncle's fault.

297
00:17:38,486 --> 00:17:39,946
都是你舅舅的错
He should've taken the legions south after Pompey.

298
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,247
他应该领兵南下

299
00:17:42,357 --> 00:17:43,557
追击庞贝
The men know it, and it makes them restless.

300
00:17:43,657 --> 00:17:46,658
他知道的，那就可以让他们不得安宁

301
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,659
当然了
Of course...

302
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,530
可他却装作是胸有成竹
he pretends it is a stratagem.

303
00:17:59,601 --> 00:18:01,081
但是军营里连每只狗都知道
But every dog in camp

304
00:18:01,491 --> 00:18:04,192
是赛维莉亚让他失去了男子气概
knows that Servilia has unmanned him.

305
00:18:05,662 --> 00:18:08,223
他现在不会离开她了
He will not be parted from her.

306
00:18:09,563 --> 00:18:11,443
我…
I...

307
00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:14,594
你也看的出来
as you can tell,

308
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:17,825
依然勇猛如昔
am not unmanned.

309
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:35,869
简直是无法忍受
Intolerable. Intolerable!

310
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:36,989
无法忍受！
Calm yourself, Mother, please. You've become unbalanced.

311
00:18:36,989 --> 00:18:39,040
冷静点，妈妈，你都快神经错乱了

312
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,810
为什么要管谁和他上床呢？
Why care so much who he beds? It is trivium.

313
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:41,640
这都是小事
How you take after your father- simple as milk.

314
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,481
你怎么跟你爸爸一样，单纯

315
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:46,101
要不是他在床上
If he were not mewling in bed with that witch he would be chasing down Pompey.

316
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:48,222
跟那个婊子缠绵，他早就追杀庞贝去了

317
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,822
这可不是小事，
It is not trivium. The Republic is at stake.

318
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:51,673
共和国现在很危险
Since when do you care about the Republic?

319
00:18:51,723 --> 00:18:54,003
你什么时候开始关心共和国的？

320
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:56,074
我一直关心共和国
I care deeply about the Republic.

321
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:57,024
很不明智
It would be very unwise to cause trouble about this.

322
00:18:57,034 --> 00:18:58,514
为了这个生事

323
00:18:59,324 --> 00:19:00,174
当然了，
Of course. I wouldn't lower myself.

324
00:19:00,385 --> 00:19:02,145
我不会自降身价的

325
00:19:04,485 --> 00:19:08,156
这对肮脏的狗男女自然会被曝光的
Such sordid couplings have a way of turning out badly anyhow...

326
00:19:08,186 --> 00:19:10,787
不需要任何人干什么
by no one's special doing.

327
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:13,187
家庭教师来了
 Tutor has arrived.  Oh good.

328
00:19:13,357 --> 00:19:14,778
哦，好

329
00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:19,719
你的老师来了，在后院等呢
Your tutor has arrived and waits in the rear yard.

330
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:21,429
老师？什么老师？
Tutor? What tutor?

331
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:24,090
你早就该学学男人的技艺了
It's high time you learned the masculine arts.

332
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,150
如何格斗
How to fight and copulate and skin animals and so forth.

333
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,231
如何交媾，还有如何给动物剥皮

334
00:19:27,331 --> 00:19:27,971
一切类似的东西
There's plenty of time yet for all that.

335
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:29,541
要学那些还有很长时间呢

336
00:19:29,631 --> 00:19:33,092
你还有很多时间去看那些没用的书
Plenty of time for you to bury yourself in worthless scribbles.

337
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:35,202
你可以看这些希腊破书
You may read those old Greek fools

338
00:19:35,202 --> 00:19:37,783
看到眼睛流血，但是你还是成不了智者
until blood runs from your eyes, you'll be none the wiser.

339
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:38,643
才不是呢，
I cannot agree. The Greek philosophers have much to teach us.

340
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:40,614
希腊的智者教会了我们很多东西

341
00:19:41,064 --> 00:19:42,784
那么，这就是一个希腊智者
Well, here's a Greek philosopher for you.

342
00:19:45,275 --> 00:19:47,785
我把你的那个士兵叫来了
I've engaged that soldier of yours.

343
00:19:47,905 --> 00:19:48,575
乌瑞纳斯？
 vorenus?  Was that it?

344
00:19:48,635 --> 00:19:50,276
是他吗？
Not the sullen Catonian one, I don't like him.

345
00:19:50,376 --> 00:19:51,706
不是那个一脸严肃的，

346
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:52,736
我不喜欢他
 The cheerful brutish one.  Pullo.

347
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:54,827
是那个长得像野兽的

348
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:57,027
波罗，不错，就是他，
That's it. What extraordinary names these plebs have.

349
00:19:57,137 --> 00:20:00,138
他们的名字真够怪的

350
00:20:00,138 --> 00:20:01,438
波罗
Pullo.

351
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:03,089
防守！
Defend! Shield.

352
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:05,909
盾牌，盾牌
Shield.

353
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,510
别乱挥
Don't wave it about.

354
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,641
盾牌
Shield.

355
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:14,961
够了！！
Enough!

356
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:19,472
水
Water.

357
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:33,406
真是荒谬
This is absurd.

358
00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:36,016
我没有搏击的天分
I have no soldiery stuff in me.

359
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,157
这么强行去打只会让我发烧
And this exertion brings on a fever.

360
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:39,517
我的脾脏都有感觉了
 I feel it in my spleen.  You're just not used to it.

361
00:20:39,527 --> 00:20:40,897
你只是没习惯罢了
It takes time. I've seen you kill.

362
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,258
这是需要时间的，

363
00:20:42,288 --> 00:20:43,818
我见过你杀人
 There's plenty of soldier in you.  It's not the killing.

364
00:20:44,158 --> 00:20:46,429
你可是很有天分的

365
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:47,429
不是杀人的问题，
It's the waving about of swords I find tedious.

366
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:50,009
我只是觉得舞剑很没意思

367
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:51,930
我敢说我能够很容易地杀人
I dare say I can kill people readily enough,

368
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,390
只要他们不还手
as long as they're not fighting back.

369
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,340
别怕，小主人，
Never fear, young Dominus. We'll make a regular terror of you.

370
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,201
我们会把你变得让人胆寒
At best I will be a middling swordsman.

371
00:20:56,231 --> 00:20:58,161
我只能成为庸手
 It's better than nothing.  There you are wrong.

372
00:20:58,161 --> 00:20:59,962
 总比什么不会的强  那你就错了，
The graveyards are full of middling swordsmen.

373
00:21:00,162 --> 00:21:02,702
死的都是那些庸手

374
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,343
与其当庸手还不如什么都不会好
Best to be no swordsman at all than a middling swordsman.

375
00:21:08,163 --> 00:21:09,714
不准那样
Don't do that.

376
00:21:10,964 --> 00:21:11,954
对不起
Excuse me.

377
00:21:19,206 --> 00:21:20,456
小主人
Young Dominus...

378
00:21:20,606 --> 00:21:22,057
我要请教一下你的意见
I need your advice on a delicate matter,

379
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:24,727
 关于一件复杂的事情，如果你乐意的话，  没问题
 if you'd be willing?  I am.

380
00:21:25,537 --> 00:21:28,218
假设你看到了一件事情，让你怀疑另一件事情…
Suppose you saw something which made you suspect something--

381
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:29,258
一件可怕的事情
something terrible.

382
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:32,909
你会告诉被怀疑那个人的丈夫吗？
Would you tell the husband of the suspicious article?

383
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:34,629
怀疑她什么？
Suppose suspicion of what?

384
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,770
另一个男人
 Another man.  Ah.

385
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:42,531
我猜你说的是乌瑞纳斯和他的妻子
We are speaking of vorenus and his wife, I presume.

386
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:43,531
我没有那么说过
I never said that.

387
00:21:46,452 --> 00:21:49,743
在我看来光是怀疑还是不够的
It seems to me that suspicion alone is not enough to speak.

388
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:53,064
一旦怀疑到这种事情
Once spoken out, the suspicion of such depravity

389
00:21:53,064 --> 00:21:54,834
找到实在的证据才是正确的
is real enough to do the work of truth.

390
00:21:55,754 --> 00:21:57,435
要是你弄错了呢？
And what if you are mistaken?

391
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:59,905
那么乌瑞纳斯就会因为你的错误蒙羞
Then vorenus is dishonored by error.

392
00:22:00,955 --> 00:22:04,106
事实最重要，没有事实你什么都不能说
Facts are necessary. Without facts, you must remain silent.

393
00:22:06,087 --> 00:22:08,137
我知道你会说的那么透彻的
I knew you'd hit the jugular.

394
00:22:31,402 --> 00:22:34,053
拒绝休战
Refuses truce.

395
00:22:34,363 --> 00:22:36,253
现在怎么办？
What now?

396
00:22:37,514 --> 00:22:38,934
怎么办？
What now?

397
00:22:42,575 --> 00:22:44,235
多开心啊，嗯？
How happy, eh?

398
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:46,466
身为奴隶
To be a slave.

399
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,136
没有自己的意志
To have no will.

400
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,097
不用做任何决定
To make no decisions.

401
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,177
像段漂流的朽木
Driftwood.

402
00:22:53,777 --> 00:22:56,328
那会是多么宁静的事啊
How very restful it must be.

403
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:12,502
 伊拉斯提斯·富罗门  百夫长
 Erastes Fulmen.  Centurion.

404
00:23:15,412 --> 00:23:16,893
我来是想问一下你的建议
I have come to seek your counsel.

405
00:23:17,193 --> 00:23:18,743
非常乐意
Always happy to help a friend.

406
00:23:19,783 --> 00:23:21,654
我想问你借点钱
I need to borrow some money

407
00:23:21,654 --> 00:23:23,704
听人说你有朋友从事贷款这个行业
and I am told you have friends in the lending trade.

408
00:23:24,224 --> 00:23:26,175
不错
I do.

409
00:23:26,355 --> 00:23:28,075
不错，我犹豫
I do. I only hesitate because I'm surprised.

410
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,966
是因为我有点惊讶
You was well found.

411
00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:32,396
你手头应该不缺钱吧
My slaves were taken by the black flux.

412
00:23:32,426 --> 00:23:35,827
我的奴隶都患了病

413
00:23:35,857 --> 00:23:37,097
但是我一但有了资金我就会
But once I raise capital, I'll go up North and buy some more.

414
00:23:37,107 --> 00:23:38,948
北上买更多奴隶
I have good contacts in Narbo.

415
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,888
我在纳尔波有很多关系
 Be needing a big chunk then?  I will.

416
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:42,138
那就是要很大一笔了，对吧

417
00:23:42,148 --> 00:23:42,968
不错

418
00:23:45,729 --> 00:23:47,249
不行
I cannot.

419
00:23:47,389 --> 00:23:50,970
把你引到这条路上来是不对的
Wrong to lead a citizen like yourself down that path.

420
00:23:52,061 --> 00:23:53,931
这是个很粗暴的行业，放贷
Rough business, moneylending.

421
00:23:54,031 --> 00:23:56,211
还不起钱就得受罪的
Man can't pay, he may have to suffer.

422
00:23:56,362 --> 00:23:59,212
我要是把你介绍给放贷的
Was I to introduce you to a lender,

423
00:23:59,212 --> 00:24:02,093
就像是把两头狼放到一个笼子里
I would be putting two wolves into one cage.

424
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:03,773
没有一方会得到好处
To neither's benefit.

425
00:24:05,204 --> 00:24:05,924
不错，
You're right. You're right.

426
00:24:06,434 --> 00:24:08,584
你是对的， 谢谢你抽时间
Thank you for your time.

427
00:24:08,634 --> 00:24:10,815
百夫长，还有一条路可以赚钱
Centurion, there are other ways to make money.

428
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:13,496
像你这样的人，
Man like you, there's situations

429
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,315
只需要露个脸就可以值很多钱
his simple presence would be valuable.

430
00:24:16,096 --> 00:24:17,766
像我这样的人？ 铁汉
 A man like me.  A hard man.

431
00:24:18,077 --> 00:24:21,637
恺撒第13军团的百夫长
First Spear Centurion in Caesar's mighty 13th.

432
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:23,538
 我已经退役了  没关系
 I'm no longer in the army.  No matter.

433
00:24:23,638 --> 00:24:25,028
就你的样子已经足够了
Your bearing is enough.

434
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:30,339
你可以把你的荣耀和力量借给做生意的人
You would lend dignity and strength to business transactions.

435
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:32,500
如果你愿意的话，我就想雇用你
If you like, I could use you myself.

436
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,450
让你看看那些羡慕的眼光
Show you the onions.

437
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,611
谢谢你的好意，不过
That's good of you,

438
00:24:36,911 --> 00:24:39,291
我还不清楚你要我作甚么？
but I still don't see what I would do exactly.

439
00:24:41,182 --> 00:24:45,173
你来和我一起解决一些麻烦
You would come with me to discourage trouble.

440
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:48,503
没有人会跟百夫长找麻烦的
No one's going to mess with a First Spear Centurion.

441
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:50,544
做保镖？
I'd be a bodyguard.

442
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:58,145
会有很多钱
Good money.

443
00:25:00,426 --> 00:25:02,066
我告诉过你的，我告诉过你的！
I told you! I told you!

444
00:25:02,226 --> 00:25:04,757
对不起，我情不自禁，我没法…
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. I can't--

445
00:25:04,957 --> 00:25:06,047
去你的，
Damn you! Damn her! I am your wife.

446
00:25:06,057 --> 00:25:07,428
我可是你的妻子！
Me. I am your wife.

447
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:09,388
我，你的妻子

448
00:25:10,428 --> 00:25:11,509
莱蒂！
Lyde!

449
00:25:32,503 --> 00:25:34,014
真好看
That's lovely.

450
00:25:35,064 --> 00:25:36,964
看起来不像军人吧？
It's not too army-like?

451
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:39,055
像个做生意的
Like a man of deep business.

452
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:41,575
我不是生意人，只是个保镖
I'm no business man. I'm just a bodyguard.

453
00:25:42,436 --> 00:25:43,446
刚开始嘛
It's a start.

454
00:25:58,779 --> 00:25:59,839
赛维莉亚是恺撒的情妇
Please please, just for me.

455
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:18,624
大家都怎么了？
What is the matter with everybody?

456
00:26:23,145 --> 00:26:24,165
恺撒的御用吹萧
Lock him up, girls! Lock him up!

457
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,375
Ohh! Oy, Calpurnia!

458
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,978
Ooh, yes!

459
00:26:35,047 --> 00:26:37,318
恺撒是赛维莉亚的性奴

460
00:26:40,169 --> 00:26:42,599
 卡普尼娅…  不要管那些风言风语
 Calpurnia-  Do not trouble yourself with denial.

461
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:45,460
 我不是故意的  离开她，我不会再说了
 I did not intend to.  Be rid of her and we'll say no more.

462
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,701
 我们别…  否则就离婚
 Let us not-  Or divorce will follow.

463
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:52,041
或许那不足以阻拦你
Perhaps that is not enough to deter you.

464
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:55,062
那就那样吧，反正我是不会关心的
Be that as it may, I am indifferent.

465
00:26:57,813 --> 00:26:59,633
现在可不能离婚啊
We cannot divorce now.

466
00:26:59,663 --> 00:27:01,764
 她家族的支持很关键
Her family's influence will be critical--

467
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,515
我知道
I know it.

468
00:27:04,184 --> 00:27:05,284
恺撒狂操赛维莉亚
Bring me out the smaller scales.

469
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:09,875
 百夫长，你来的正好  公民
 Centurion, you're right on time.  Citizen.

470
00:27:11,606 --> 00:27:13,146
我们为什么不在市场上见面？
Why do we not meet in the Forum?

471
00:27:13,186 --> 00:27:16,957
市场只是给那些快完成的交易，是公开的
Forum's only for closing deals, putting a hand on it public-like.

472
00:27:23,858 --> 00:27:26,509
别吹了！
Enough of that Teuton droning!

473
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:28,880
要是你真想学那些无业游民那样吹口哨
If you want to whistle like someone's bum boy,

474
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,938
吹点好听的罗马小调
whistle a good Roman song at least.

475
00:27:34,551 --> 00:27:36,411
她老是抱怨我像头大象
And she complained I was like an elephant.

476
00:27:36,411 --> 00:27:38,142
塔基特，我的小鸭子
Tanjit, my honey duck,

477
00:27:38,342 --> 00:27:40,802
 你看起来很好嘛  伊拉特斯·富罗门
 you're looking well.  Erastes Fulmen.

478
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:43,173
向你妈妈问好
I kiss your mother's feet.

479
00:27:43,213 --> 00:27:45,153
请坐吧
Please, sit.

480
00:27:45,183 --> 00:27:47,734
要什么东西吃喝？
Would you like something to eat, drink?

481
00:27:47,764 --> 00:27:52,065
 来点葡萄酒吧  我们没有酒，牛奶如何？
 Wine will do.  We do not have wine. Milk, perhaps?

482
00:27:52,065 --> 00:27:54,625
牛奶？你的尿喝完了吧？
Milk?! Run out of piss, did you?

483
00:27:57,546 --> 00:27:59,096
真会开玩笑，呵呵
Humor. very good.

484
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:01,627
非得要我到这里来我觉得很不高兴，塔基特
I'm sad to have to come here, Tanjit.

485
00:28:01,657 --> 00:28:03,557
非常不高兴
I'm very depressed.

486
00:28:03,607 --> 00:28:05,598
我原以为我们都是生意人
I thought we were businessmen.

487
00:28:05,688 --> 00:28:08,118
还以为我们可以互相理解，但是我们却
I thought we understood each other, yet here we are.

488
00:28:08,128 --> 00:28:09,049
来到这种地步
Here we are.

489
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:12,599
我只会问你一次
I'm only going to ask once.

490
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,300
我的钱呢？
Where's my money?

491
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,720
我要买的猪呢？
Where's my truffle pigs?

492
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,311
你不就叫我订了50只猪嘛
50 pigs you have as ordered.

493
00:28:18,311 --> 00:28:21,461
你给了我50只病猪
50 diseased and scrofulous pigs.

494
00:28:21,802 --> 00:28:24,932
 其中有一只知道怎么去找蘑菇吃的  狡猾的畜生
 And one knows how to find truffles.  Tricky beasts.

495
00:28:24,962 --> 00:28:26,803
他们没吃橡树果吗？
Haven't been eating acorns, have they?

496
00:28:26,803 --> 00:28:28,103
去他妈的蘑菇，太多的橡树果了
Fucks them for truffling, too much acorns.

497
00:28:28,823 --> 00:28:31,364
我可以还你1/4的钱，出于我们的友谊
I will give you one quarter price. Out of friendship.

498
00:28:31,694 --> 00:28:35,305
你一个子儿都别想少，你这个胡子拉扎的奸贼
You'll give me every mumping denarius

499
00:28:35,355 --> 00:28:35,875
真的
 you cac-faced cunny!  Really,

500
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:37,805
让我们不要用野蛮来解决问题
there is no call for rudeness.

501
00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:40,516
我听说印度人死了以后生命不灭？真的吗？
I'm told Hindus live on after death. Is that true?

502
00:28:40,546 --> 00:28:43,637
我们死了也会腐化，跟你们一样
Our bodies die and decay as yours will.

503
00:28:43,657 --> 00:28:45,947
但是我们的灵魂永生
But our souls live on eternally.

504
00:28:46,497 --> 00:28:47,617
嗯，那样的安排不错
Well, that's nice arrangements.

505
00:28:47,777 --> 00:28:49,808
 那么你就是不怕死咯？ 一点都不怕
 You're not afraid to die then?  Not at all.

506
00:29:02,671 --> 00:29:04,501
敲断他的手
Break his arm.

507
00:29:05,852 --> 00:29:08,802
敲断他的手
Break his arm.

508
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:35,818
还我钱，你这个猴崽子
Give me my money, you monkey's cunt.

509
00:29:35,838 --> 00:29:37,459
去死吧
Kiss my ass.

510
00:29:38,589 --> 00:29:40,609
割了他的喉咙
Cut his throat.

511
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,241
快割！
Cut it!

512
00:30:11,396 --> 00:30:13,667
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

513
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,791
发生什么事了？
What happened?

514
00:30:31,171 --> 00:30:33,601
怎么了？告诉我
What's wrong? Tell me.

515
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:38,022
伊拉特斯·富罗门要我杀人
Erastes Fulmen asked me to kill a man.

516
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,833
你不答应？
You refused him?

517
00:30:41,863 --> 00:30:44,224
我还能怎么样？
What else was I to do?

518
00:30:44,264 --> 00:30:46,404
 我又不是强盗  你当然不是了
 I am no bandit.  Of course you're not.

519
00:30:46,434 --> 00:30:48,045
你不能像从前那样杀人了
You couldn't do other than you did.

520
00:30:48,105 --> 00:30:50,545
不过我们怎么给租金啊？
But how are we to pay the rent?

521
00:30:51,025 --> 00:30:54,186
怎么养活孩子们？
How are we to feed the children?

522
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:04,108
他来了！
He's here!

523
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:08,929
我真高兴！我还以为你不会…
I'm so glad! I thought you might not--

524
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:11,420
抱歉我不能呆下去了
I regret I cannot stay.

525
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:15,441
我是来道别的
I've come to say goodbye.

526
00:31:16,031 --> 00:31:17,111
道别？
Goodbye?

527
00:31:17,171 --> 00:31:20,342
我要南下追击庞贝
I'm going south in pursuit of Pompey,

528
00:31:20,362 --> 00:31:23,723
我们不会再见面了
and we shall not see each other again.

529
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:26,403
 什么？永不？ 永不
 What, never?  Never.

530
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:30,804
别这么开玩笑
Don't joke so.

531
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:33,125
我没有开玩笑
I am not joking.

532
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:35,106
 是不是因为那些愚蠢的画
Is this because of some foolish graffi--

533
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,287
赛维莉亚，我们结束了
Servilia, we are done.

534
00:31:47,058 --> 00:31:49,419
你怎么能这么说？
How can you say that?

535
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,850
 我们彼此爱着对方
We love each other.

536
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,912
 是的
Be assured,

537
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:00,273
并不是我不爱你
it is not that l do not love you.

538
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:02,451
我这么做是与我的意愿相背的
I do this against my own inclination.

539
00:32:02,492 --> 00:32:05,732
不过，有更危急的事情要我去处理
There are, however, larger issues at stake,

540
00:32:05,752 --> 00:32:08,443
而我必须做出对共和国有利的事
and I must do what is right for the Republic.

541
00:32:09,213 --> 00:32:11,714
共和国？！
The Republic?!

542
00:32:46,972 --> 00:32:49,102
为什么这么高兴？妈妈？
Why so happy, Mother?

543
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:51,293
没事
No reason.

544
00:32:51,363 --> 00:32:52,623
一点事情都没有？
None at all?

545
00:32:52,863 --> 00:32:55,363
没有什么聪明的计划得逞了？
No clever little plan bearing fruit?

546
00:32:55,503 --> 00:32:57,514
没有，我的宝贝
None at all, my poppet.

547
00:32:57,534 --> 00:33:00,405
没有其他的暗示
Nor should you suggest otherwise...

548
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:02,015
对任何人
to anyone.

549
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:08,766
这么慌慌张张的干什么？
What's all the fuss?

550
00:33:09,407 --> 00:33:11,807
 我们明天南下  太好了
 We go south tomorrow.  Excellent.

551
00:33:11,887 --> 00:33:14,448
要是我们动作快的话，不到初一庞贝就会遭殃了
If we move fast, Pompey will be eating dust by the Kalends.

552
00:33:14,478 --> 00:33:17,699
你和第13军团留在这里，维持秩序
You'll remain here with the 13th to keep the peace.

553
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,019
维持秩序？
Keep the peace?

554
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:22,019
罗马城由你来接管。我会把波斯卡留下来帮你
The city will be in your charge. I'll leave Posca to assist you.

555
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:25,120
太荒谬了，我是军人，又不是维持秩序的
That's ridiculous! I'm a soldier, not a peacekeeper.

556
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:28,721
你要服从命令，妈的
You will follow orders, damn you.

557
00:33:45,945 --> 00:33:48,746
我在考虑…
I was considering...

558
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,719
I'm sick and tired--

559
00:33:52,856 --> 00:33:56,197
我在附近有个农庄
...I have a farm near here.

560
00:33:56,997 --> 00:33:59,758
一年里这个时候景色漂亮极了
Lovely at this time of year.

561
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:03,809
我想我可能去那里
I was considering that I might go there.

562
00:34:05,219 --> 00:34:08,550
呆在那里过收获期
Stay for the harvest.

563
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,611
要么你和我一起去？
Perhaps you'd like to join me?

564
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:14,061
谢谢了
That is very kind,

565
00:34:14,091 --> 00:34:16,982
不过我还是留在这里
but I think I will stay here.

566
00:34:21,503 --> 00:34:24,024
留下来没有好处的
No good will come of staying.

567
00:34:24,074 --> 00:34:26,164
不知道
I don't know.

568
00:34:26,414 --> 00:34:28,234
至少大海让人觉得鼓舞
The sea air is bracing at least.

569
00:34:28,284 --> 00:34:31,935
你若是不走，我也走不了
If you do not go then I cannot go, I suppose.

570
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:33,926
那样我就显得太懦夫了
It would look cowardly.

571
00:34:33,956 --> 00:34:37,337
有关系吗？即使不是如此你也早就知道了
What matter? You would know it were not so.

572
00:34:37,337 --> 00:34:39,037
是啊，我当然早就知道
Oh, I would know, certainly.

573
00:34:40,087 --> 00:34:42,159
但是我不像你
But I do not have

574
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:45,478
有一个光芒显赫的姓氏
a grand shining old name like you.

575
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,389
我得把我的族姓好好保留下去
I must keep my name well-polished,

576
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:51,770
否则就会永远抬不起头来
else it looks very dull.

577
00:34:55,851 --> 00:34:59,562
 那我就得留下来了  对不起了，老家伙
 I must stay then  I'm sorry, old man.

578
00:35:56,314 --> 00:35:58,195
士兵！
Soldier!

579
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,586
你在当值
You're on duty.

580
00:36:02,376 --> 00:36:05,206
将军可以见你了
The general will see you now.

581
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,241
把这份抄录了
Copy this.

582
00:36:39,094 --> 00:36:41,675
公民，你想干什么？
What do you want, citizen?

583
00:36:43,315 --> 00:36:46,376
我重新考虑了我的情况，长官
I've reconsidered my position, sir.

584
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:49,496
我想接受你的提议
I wish to accept your offer.

585
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,197
我的提议？
My offer?

586
00:36:53,097 --> 00:36:55,038
成为留用士官
Of entry into Evocati.

587
00:36:55,058 --> 00:36:57,248
要是条件都没有过时的话
If same terms still apply.

588
00:36:57,898 --> 00:37:01,609
我说过你可以当留用士官吗？
I said you could join Evocati?

589
00:37:01,899 --> 00:37:05,110
是的，长官，你说过
With respect, sir, you did.

590
00:37:12,962 --> 00:37:15,422
我开出什么条件？
What terms did I offer?

591
00:37:15,492 --> 00:37:20,113
一级留用士官，1万赛斯特斯
Evocati Prefect first grade, 10,000 sesterces.

592
00:37:21,174 --> 00:37:26,155
那个条件真够慷慨的，不过你却拒绝了
That's a generous offer. One which you declined.

593
00:37:30,576 --> 00:37:34,587
一般我从不会两次给出同一个提议
Normally, I would never make the same offer twice,

594
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:36,147
不过你很走运
but you're lucky.

595
00:37:36,197 --> 00:37:38,448
恺撒走了
Cesar is away,

596
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:41,248
我只有一个人
and I am here alone.

597
00:37:41,778 --> 00:37:44,709
我会很需要能人
And I shall need good men.

598
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:47,930
所以我给你
So I give it you,

599
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,350
升到士官
promotion to Prefect

600
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,811
9千赛斯特斯
and 9,000 sesterces.

601
00:37:56,172 --> 00:37:58,552
谢谢你，长官
Thank you, sir.

602
00:37:59,322 --> 00:38:01,503
为了回报我的慷慨
In return for my generosity,

603
00:38:01,553 --> 00:38:04,173
卢休斯·乌瑞纳斯
Lucius vorenus,

604
00:38:04,523 --> 00:38:06,384
我要你的忠诚
I expect loyalty.

605
00:38:06,434 --> 00:38:09,024
至死的忠诚
Loyalty unto death.

606
00:38:10,465 --> 00:38:13,035
至死的忠诚
Unto death, sir.

607
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,537
欢迎回来
Welcome home.

608
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:30,939
解散
Dismissed.

609
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:39,011
带他进来，主人
Put him here. Domina...

610
00:38:39,411 --> 00:38:42,412
他是其中一个，画那些淫画的人
this is one of them that drew the filthy pictures.

611
00:38:42,412 --> 00:38:44,522
让他开口没花多长时间
Didn't take long to make him speak.

612
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:46,203
嗯？你这个禽兽！
Eh? Creature!

613
00:38:47,253 --> 00:38:49,094
谁雇他的？
Who hired him?

614
00:38:49,124 --> 00:38:52,084
蒂门，那个犹太人
Timon, the Horse Jew.

615
00:38:52,144 --> 00:38:54,185
阿提娅的人
Atia's man.

616
00:38:54,225 --> 00:38:55,645
给我穿衣服
Dress me.

617
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,399
 搞定了  他们让你回去了？
 It's done.  They'll have you back?

618
00:39:12,829 --> 00:39:14,939
是的
They will.

619
00:39:40,305 --> 00:39:44,836
一级留用士官，9千赛斯特斯
Evocati Prefect first grade, 9,000 sesterces.

620
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,697
我把自己卖给了暴君
I've sold myself to a tyrant.

621
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:56,969
只能这样了
It had to be done.

622
00:39:59,049 --> 00:40:00,840
谢谢你
Thank you.

623
00:41:17,197 --> 00:41:19,398
朱利埃的众神
Gods of the Junii,

624
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:22,808
以此祭品我请求您召集
with this offering I ask you to summon

625
00:41:22,838 --> 00:41:26,659
堤喀，美格拉和复仇女神
Tyche, Maegara and Nemesis,

626
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:30,140
让他们见证这个诅咒
so that they witness this curse.

627
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:34,461
以我先人灵魂的名义
By the spirits of my ancestors,

628
00:41:34,511 --> 00:41:40,862
我诅咒盖乌斯·朱利叶斯·恺撒
I curse Gaius Julius Caesar.

629
00:41:40,892 --> 00:41:43,913
让他的阳具枯萎
Let his penis wither.

630
00:41:43,913 --> 00:41:47,304
让他的骨头折断
Let his bones crack.

631
00:41:47,334 --> 00:41:51,605
让他看到自己的军团被鲜血淹没
Let him see his legions drown in their own blood.

632
00:41:51,665 --> 00:41:53,355
地狱的众神
Gods of the inferno,

633
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:56,946
我向您供上他的四肢
I offer to you his limbs,

634
00:41:56,976 --> 00:41:58,926
他的头颅
his head,

635
00:41:58,956 --> 00:42:00,867
他的嘴
his mouth,

636
00:42:00,907 --> 00:42:02,787
他的呼吸
his breath,

637
00:42:02,817 --> 00:42:04,978
他的话语
his speech,

638
00:42:05,008 --> 00:42:06,848
他的双手
his hands,

639
00:42:06,878 --> 00:42:08,639
他的肝脏
his liver,

640
00:42:09,409 --> 00:42:12,810
他的心脏还有胃
his heart, his stomach.

641
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:17,621
地狱的众神，请让我看到他饱受痛苦
Gods of the inferno, Iet me see him suffer deeply

642
00:42:17,651 --> 00:42:19,731
我将欣喜地
and I will rejoice

643
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:23,092
把自己奉献给您
and sacrifice to you.

644
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,290
以我先人灵魂的名义
By the spirits of my ancestors,

645
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,901
我诅咒阿提娅
I curse Atia of the Julii.

646
00:43:01,931 --> 00:43:04,391
让她被野狗强暴

647
00:43:04,441 --> 00:43:07,072
让他的儿女死去
Let her children die

648
00:43:07,092 --> 00:43:09,072
让她的家园被焚毁
and her houses burn.

649
00:43:09,112 --> 00:43:15,624
让她怀着痛苦羞耻度过漫长的一生
Let her live a long life of bitter misery and shame.

650
00:43:16,304 --> 00:43:18,965
地狱的众神
Gods of the inferno,

651
00:43:18,965 --> 00:43:21,665
我将供上她的四肢
I offer to you her limbs,

652
00:43:21,775 --> 00:43:23,416
她的头颅
her head,

653
00:43:23,466 --> 00:43:26,476
她的嘴，她的呼吸

654
00:43:26,616 --> 00:43:29,957
她的话语，她的心脏

655
00:43:29,997 --> 00:43:33,628
她的肝脏，她的胃

656
00:43:34,108 --> 00:43:37,259
地狱的众神

657
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:39,259
让我看到她备受痛苦
Iet me see her suffer deeply,

658
00:43:39,309 --> 00:43:40,930
我将会欣喜地
and I will rejoice

659
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:43,990
把自己奉献给您
and sacrifice to you.

660
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,230
 好了，我的朋友  你们想干什么？
 Here we are then, friend.  What do you want?

661
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,101
告诉我们你和尼奥比之间发生了什么事情
 Tell us what's between you and Niobe.  Eh?

662
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:33,982
尼奥比？没有，从来没有
Niobe? Nothing. Never.

663
00:44:34,012 --> 00:44:36,602
我向朱庇特神起誓，绝对没有！
I swear by Jupiter, never!

664
00:44:36,832 --> 00:44:39,023
若是我撒谎，让复仇女神把我的眼睛挖出来！
Furies tear my eyes out if I lie!

665
00:44:39,023 --> 00:44:42,063
我见到你们在一起的时候在干什么？
What were you doing when I saw you with her?

666
00:44:42,103 --> 00:44:45,024
我和我妻子吵架了
My wife- we were fighting.

667
00:44:45,064 --> 00:44:47,004
我去问问尼奥比应该怎么办，仅此而已
I went to Niobe for advice, that's all.

668
00:44:48,275 --> 00:44:51,185
我哭了，要是你非得知道真相的话
I was crying, if you want to know the truth,

669
00:44:51,195 --> 00:44:52,916
尼奥比很同情我
and Niobe commiserated with me.

670
00:44:52,946 --> 00:44:55,746
我决不…决不会…
I would never- I would never--

671
00:44:59,977 --> 00:45:02,588
 可能他说的是真的  撒谎
 Maybe he's telling the truth.  Lying.

672
00:45:02,598 --> 00:45:06,366
 没有！没有撒谎！    撒谎！
I'm not!  I'm not!   Lying.

673
00:45:06,649 --> 00:45:10,240
如果他说你是撒谎，我信他
If he says you're lying, then I believe him.

674
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,270
这个小孩子比你想象的还要聪明
This boy is clever like you don't know what.

675
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,991
 不，不要，求你了  别吵！
 No, please, I beg you!  Hush.

676
00:45:15,031 --> 00:45:17,871
不要让自己难堪
Don't embarrass yourself.

677
00:45:27,084 --> 00:45:29,814
我们知道你撒谎，知道的，懂吗？
We know you're lying. We know it, you understand?

678
00:45:29,814 --> 00:45:31,415
我们得杀了你
We have to kill you.

679
00:45:31,705 --> 00:45:34,975
 我从来没有碰过她  伊万达，往前一点
 I never touched her.  Evander, move forward.

680
00:45:34,995 --> 00:45:36,116
你的小命快没了
Your life is over. The only question is,

681
00:45:36,146 --> 00:45:39,846
唯一的问题是，你想怎么个死法？
how do you want to die?

682
00:45:40,147 --> 00:45:41,737
我们要知道真相
We need to hear the truth.

683
00:45:41,797 --> 00:45:44,317
要是你坚持不说真话，我们会折磨你
If you persist in lying to us, we'll torture you.

684
00:45:44,357 --> 00:45:46,988
你再备受几小时的痛苦煎熬和恐怖之后才会慢慢死去
You'll die only after many hours of agony and horror.

685
00:45:47,008 --> 00:45:50,309
不过要是老老实实，你会死的很快，毫无痛苦
But give us honesty now, and you'll go swiftly, painlessly.

686
00:45:50,479 --> 00:45:53,510
 求你们了  伊万达，说真话
 Please.  Evander, tell the truth.

687
00:45:58,851 --> 00:46:02,542
 折磨他  说的好听，真有你的
 Torture him.  Juno's cunt, but you're salty.

688
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:04,122
我开始还还怕把你带来呢
And I was worried about bringing you.

689
00:46:04,152 --> 00:46:06,242
那就开始吧
Go on then.

690
00:46:06,693 --> 00:46:09,983
其实我没有折磨过人
I've never actually tortured anyone.

691
00:46:10,003 --> 00:46:12,374
 不知道该怎么折磨  不知道？
 I don't know how.  You don't know how?

692
00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:15,905
 他们都有专家的  割了他的拇指
 They have specialists!  Why not cut off his thumbs?

693
00:46:15,965 --> 00:46:18,435
很好的开始
That's good enough. It's a start.

694
00:46:18,585 --> 00:46:24,156
尼奥比和我是情人，我招了
Niobe and I were lovers. I confess it.

695
00:46:24,387 --> 00:46:27,137
杀了我吧
Kill me if you must.

696
00:46:28,217 --> 00:46:30,378
等等
Hold.

697
00:46:32,648 --> 00:46:34,109
还有呢？
What else?

698
00:46:34,149 --> 00:46:38,070
没有了，杀了我吧
Nothing else. Kill me.

699
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,450
你又撒谎！
You're lying again.

700
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:43,011
站在你面前的是波罗
You stand at Pluto's door. Will you sully his threshold with lies?

701
00:46:43,031 --> 00:46:44,801
你想用谎言挑战他忍耐的极限吗？
 I am done talking.  Cut off his thumbs.

702
00:46:44,871 --> 00:46:47,552
 我说完了  再割一个拇指

703
00:47:32,132 --> 00:47:33,872
那个孩子！
The child!

704
00:47:33,992 --> 00:47:38,963
 孩子是我的  孩子？什么孩子？
 The child is mine!  Child? What child?

705
00:47:39,043 --> 00:47:40,554
卢休斯
Lucius.

706
00:47:40,554 --> 00:47:41,644
那个婴儿
The baby.

707
00:47:42,964 --> 00:47:44,775
快杀了我吧
Please, kill me now. Please.

708
00:47:44,805 --> 00:47:50,306
 卢休斯，沃里娜的儿子？ 尼奥比的儿子
 Lucius, vorenus' son?  Niobe's son.

709
00:47:50,606 --> 00:47:52,777
我的儿子
My son.

710
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:01,288
是我的
It's mine.

711
00:48:56,231 --> 00:48:58,701
我们已经把这个禽兽给埋了
We have buried this evil now.

712
00:48:58,741 --> 00:49:01,382
以后你再也不许提起这件事
You must never speak of it again.

713
00:49:01,652 --> 00:49:04,613
千万不能让乌瑞纳斯知道
vorenus must never know.

714
00:49:04,743 --> 00:49:06,803
决不可以
Never.

715
00:49:06,863 --> 00:49:09,084
决不可以
Never.

716
00:49:11,524 --> 00:49:14,025
战神啊
Father Mars Strider,

717
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:17,486
这个人已经忠诚地为你守夜
this man has done faithful vigil for you.

718
00:49:17,756 --> 00:49:21,877
我们请求您赐他予庇护
We therefore ask you to take him under your protection.

719
00:49:21,907 --> 00:49:24,477
让他的敌人望风而逃
May his enemies flee from him.

720
00:49:24,507 --> 00:49:27,308
让敌人的城墙颤抖
May their city walls crumble.

721
00:49:27,328 --> 00:49:30,379
让他们的牧群和女人为我们捕获
May their cattle and women be taken.

722
00:49:30,449 --> 00:49:31,969
这个人…
This man...

723
00:49:32,009 --> 00:49:34,990
现在是留用士官了
is now Evocati.

724
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:04,556
大人，他们坐船去希腊了
Sir, they've sailed for Greece.

725
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:06,548

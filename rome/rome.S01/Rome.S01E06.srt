1
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,443
我在想
 l was thinking Hmm?

2
00:02:33,443 --> 00:02:35,444
我在想…
I was thinking...

3
00:02:36,745 --> 00:02:39,376
你和我可以离开这里到拜亚去玩玩
you and I might go away to Baia.

4
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:41,447
就下次赶集日过后
Hmm? After next market day.

5
00:02:41,517 --> 00:02:44,049
那里应该不错
It's supposed to be nice there

6
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:46,820
 看那儿最近有很多人去… 这个主意倒挺好，可是…
 and seeing how crowded it's been-  That's a lovely idea, but--

7
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,951
可是什么？
But what?

8
00:02:49,322 --> 00:02:51,383
我不能扔下莱蒂一个人
I can't leave Lyde alone.

9
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:54,294
 她需要我  她需要你
 She needs me.  She needs you.

10
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:56,655
伊万德已经失踪两个月了
Evander's been missing for two months. Something bad has happened.

11
00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:59,187
 有不祥的事发生了  很有可能发生了不祥的事情
very likely something bad has happened.

12
00:02:59,257 --> 00:03:01,758
很有可能他已经死了！
very likely he is dead!

13
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,195
波罗，起来！
Pullo, awake!

14
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:19,838
醒醒！马克·安东尼在等我们
Wake up! Mark Antony's waiting.

15
00:03:19,838 --> 00:03:24,841
去死吧你，你他妈的猪！
Mump off and die, you pigfucker.

16
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:28,172
好了
Right.

17
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:34,045
噢，谢谢你，我的蜜糖
Aw, thank you, my honey.

18
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:36,947
你不应该跟奴隶说谢谢
You shouldn't thank slaves.

19
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:39,428
 又没有坏处  有损军纪
 No harm in it.  It's bad for discipline.

20
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:41,149
今天早上心情不错？
Happy again this morning?

21
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,551
那内奥比呢？
Niobe, then?

22
00:03:44,611 --> 00:03:46,312
 她怎么样？ 我搞不懂她
 How's she going?  I don't understand her.

23
00:03:46,382 --> 00:03:48,713
为了她妹妹那个该死的丈夫的事情大惊小怪的
All the hoo over her sister's damn husband.

24
00:03:48,783 --> 00:03:51,285
女人，呵？也许她是…她是…
Women, eh? Maybe she's- she's--

25
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:53,356
她是什么？
She's what?

26
00:03:54,386 --> 00:03:56,387
我不知道女人，唉？
I don't know. Women, eh?

27
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,731
强大的高卢副征服者
Mighty vice-conqueror of Gaul,

28
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:26,734
男女战神都为你的所做所为而骄傲
Mars and Bellona swell with pride at your doings.

29
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:30,065
 而我说… 噢，我的神啊！你说的是些什么废话啊
 And I say-  Oh, good Juno, what cac you speak.

30
00:04:30,115 --> 00:04:32,997
你就说重点好不好？
Would you just get on with your point, man?

31
00:04:33,027 --> 00:04:33,977
马上！大人，我…
Immediately, Your Honor. I--

32
00:04:34,037 --> 00:04:36,409
政治评论家赛尔维利斯来了
Publius Servilius is here.

33
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,040
哦，好，这下可以打发走这些人了，你下去吧
Ah, good. That'll do for this crowd then. Off with you.

34
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,112
 我  你给我下去
 l-  No, off with you!

35
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,713
群马的主人，人民的护民官马克·安东尼
Master of Horse and People's Tribune Mark Antony

36
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:47,144
将于明天接待你们的请愿
will receive your petitions tomorrow.

37
00:04:49,316 --> 00:04:51,717
乌瑞纳斯！
vorenus!

38
00:04:53,248 --> 00:04:55,019
出去！
Out!

39
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:56,850
辛西娅
Cynthia,

40
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,751
梨子，亲爱的，嗯？
a pear, my love, hmm?

41
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:12,648
赛尔维利斯
Servilius,

42
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,579
我亲爱的老朋友
my dear old friend.

43
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,582
 你好吗？ 很好，身体很好，我谢谢你
 How are you?  Healthy healthy, I thank you.

44
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:23,984
恕我冒昧，我们以前见过吗？
Forgive me, have we met before?

45
00:05:24,054 --> 00:05:25,675
我们没有吗？
Have we not?

46
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:27,326
不记得了
No idea.

47
00:05:27,356 --> 00:05:30,087
我对待文官总是装成这样
I always pretend so with civilians.

48
00:05:30,157 --> 00:05:32,389
这样样更象个搞政治的，对不对？
It's more politic, nay?

49
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,361
这位一定是你美丽的夫人了
And this must be your beautiful wife,

50
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,562
她的名字我一时想不起来了
whose name escapes me.

51
00:05:39,623 --> 00:05:41,794
芭佩娅
Poppaea.

52
00:05:41,864 --> 00:05:43,695
是一种花
A flower.

53
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:45,526
你请别介意这儿乱糟糟的
You'll excuse all the bustle.

54
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:49,398
我发现庞贝的装潢品位实在是单调
I found Pompey's taste in decor rather dull.

55
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:51,199
我喜欢多点颜色
I like a little more color.

56
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:54,841
 正如你所说  我们相信你一定会把它弄的很漂亮的
 As you say.  You shall make it lovely, we are sure.

57
00:05:54,861 --> 00:05:57,402
原谅我要和你丈夫谈点公事了，好吗？
You'll forgive me if I talk business with your husband?

58
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:59,113
当然
Of course.

59
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:02,785
 就当我不在这儿  这不可能
 Pretend I am not here.  lmpossible,

60
00:06:02,855 --> 00:06:06,057
不过我试试，现在…
but I shall try. Now then...

61
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:08,089
我相信你知道恺撒
I'm sure you're aware that Caesar

62
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,126
在希腊期间让我留在这里掌管所有的事情
has left me in charge whilst he is in Greece.

63
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:15,342
是啊，他可有好玩的了，去追庞贝那些人
Yes. Off having fun chastising Pompey et al.

64
00:06:15,382 --> 00:06:18,954
留我在这里像个他妈的文官一样做些动嘴皮子，动笔的工作
Left me here to scribble and quibble like a damned civilian.

65
00:06:18,954 --> 00:06:22,004
不过我下决心做到最好，
However, I am determined to make the most of it.

66
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,812
做个好的政治家，
I shall be a good politician,

67
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,285
虽然还不如杀了我
even if it kills me.

68
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:30,280
要么就是害得别人被杀
Or if it kills anyone else for that matter.

69
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,191
好像，你是
So you are, it seems,

70
00:06:33,221 --> 00:06:35,742
留在罗马资格最老的元老院议员
the most senior senator left in Rome.

71
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:37,543
很荣幸，我是
I have that honor.

72
00:06:37,543 --> 00:06:40,345
 除此之外，还是庞贝一党的叛徒  什么！？
 And a turnabout Pompeian to boot.  l--

73
00:06:42,176 --> 00:06:44,178
正因为这样我认为
Which is why I thought

74
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,363
这么做可能很有意思
it could be amusing

75
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,950
那就是，我们让你来作今年的执政官
if we made you consul for this year.

76
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,972
执政官？
Consul?

77
00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:56,153
 这是最好… 请允许我把话说完
That's most kind--Allow me to finish speaking.

78
00:06:57,564 --> 00:06:59,955
下次元老院开会时
When the Senate next meets,

79
00:06:59,955 --> 00:07:02,108
有几项法律条款
there are a couple of legislative items

80
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,112
我希望能看到它们立即生效
I wish to see enacted immediately.

81
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:07,339
我相信你一定会乐意支持的
I am sure you will be happy to assist.

82
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:09,661
 我…我… 第一项：
 l- l-  ltem one:

83
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:11,244
元老院将批准明年
The Senate will ratify

84
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,825
选举恺撒为你的共同执政官
Caesar's election as your co-consul for the coming year.

85
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:19,796
可是不管怎样他是个独裁者啊
But he is dictator in any case.

86
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,819
还是说他是执政官比较好听，
It sounds so much better if he is consul.

87
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,739
更亲切，这条你听清了？
It's more amicable.  You got that?

88
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:29,161
 我…我，是的  第二项：你要提议
 l- I do. l- I have.  ltem two: You will propose

89
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:31,642
如下法律：
the following law:

90
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,554
即日起，在意大利每个省里
Forthwith, in every province of ltaly,

91
00:07:35,594 --> 00:07:40,397
所有畜牧业和农业的从业者的三分之一
one third of all those employed at laboring with cattle or in agriculture

92
00:07:40,657 --> 00:07:43,369
必需是自由人或是公民
must be freedmen or citizens.

93
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:44,769
我不明白
I don't understand.

94
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:48,902
有太多的奴隶了，你明白吗？他们做了所有的工作
Too many slaves, you see? They've taken all the work,

95
00:07:48,932 --> 00:07:51,393
导致自由的平民反而失业
which causes unemployment amongst the free populace.

96
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:54,545
现在，我们需要为我们的公民制造更多就业机会
Now, we need to create more jobs for our citizens.

97
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:57,466
但这样会付出很高的代价啊
But it will be hugely expensive!

98
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:58,647
是会
Mmm. It will.

99
00:07:58,677 --> 00:08:02,839
但只不过是对那些拥有所有土地的极少数的有钱人
But only to those few rich men who own all the land.

100
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:04,580
而他们也应该会很欣慰于自己
And they shall have the consolation

101
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,571
做了一件非比寻常的爱国壮举
of having done something eminently patriotic.

102
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,372
这似乎比较…
It seems rather...

103
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:12,564
极段了，至少是这样的
extreme to say the least.

104
00:08:12,594 --> 00:08:14,205
甚至可以说是破坏性的了
Ruinous even.

105
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:15,706
你有可能是对的
You may well be right.

106
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:18,367
但老实说，我才不管到底是富人还是穷人
But frankly, I do not care whether it is the rich, poor,

107
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:21,369
还是他们两边都遭殃呢
or, indeed both that suffer.

108
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:22,990
恺撒希望制订这条法律
Caesar wishes this law to be made.

109
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,111
他是我的朋友，我就要这么订
He is my friend, I will have it made.

110
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:28,463
要是你愿意，我可以绕过元老院
If you prefer, I could always bypass the Senate,

111
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:30,275
集合一群人民
call an Assembly of the People

112
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,300
你可以跟他们议论
and you can put your arguments to them.

113
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:35,847
一个像你这样优秀的雄辩家说不定就能说服他们
A fine orator like yourself might just persuade them

114
00:08:35,877 --> 00:08:38,298
证明恺撒是错的
that Caesar is wrong.

115
00:08:38,358 --> 00:08:41,029
 那就不需要了  好
 That won't be necessary.  Good.

116
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:42,570
好
Good.

117
00:08:43,921 --> 00:08:46,052
那就这样
That's it then.

118
00:08:46,973 --> 00:08:49,974
 我不知道说什么好  那就什么也别说
 I don't know what to say.  Say nothing then.

119
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:51,985
这总是最好的
It's often best.

120
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:56,207
你肯定认识波斯卡吧，恺撒的傀儡
You know Posca of course, Caesar's creature?

121
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:58,679
他会负责所有的细节的
He'll take all the details.

122
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:01,590
芭佩娅
Poppaea...

123
00:09:03,071 --> 00:09:07,273
我亲爱的，如果你的丈夫过世了…
my dove, if your husband should die...

124
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:10,805
来找我，我们结婚，如何？
come to me, we will marry, neh?

125
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:28,945
他还是遵守诺言的，对不对？
So, keeping their promises, isn't he?

126
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:30,256
什么？
What?

127
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:33,697
恺撒和马克·安东尼做的是有益于人民的事情
Caesar and Mark Antony, doing right by the people.

128
00:09:34,018 --> 00:09:35,629
你曾为这个而担心，不是吗？
That was your worry, wasn't it?

129
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:37,930
怕恺撒不过是又一个暴君？
That Caesar'd turn out to be just another tyrant sort?

130
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,821
但是现在他和马克·安东尼
But here's him and Mark Antony

131
00:09:39,851 --> 00:09:41,782
在为失业的人找工作
getting jobs for the unemployed.

132
00:09:41,812 --> 00:09:44,243
这下你总不能抱怨什么了吧，你？
You can't complain about that now, can you?

133
00:09:44,273 --> 00:09:46,264
他在议政的时候要个妓女和个侏儒在旁边陪着
He negotiates with a whore and a dwarf at his side.

134
00:09:46,494 --> 00:09:48,786
你认为辛辛纳图斯和马略即使是格拉古
Think you Cincinnatus or Marius or even the Grachii

135
00:09:48,826 --> 00:09:52,197
 会这样自贬身份吗？ 谁？
 would demean themselves so?  Who?

136
00:09:53,478 --> 00:09:57,350
谁都知道，马克·安东尼做事，有他自己的怪风格
Mark Antony has his odd ways, there's no denying that.

137
00:10:04,214 --> 00:10:06,185
我不回家，我要喝两杯
I'm not going home. I need a drink.

138
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:09,577
 喝酒？你？ 我，喝酒，怎么了？
 Drink? You?  l. Drink. What of it?

139
00:10:10,117 --> 00:10:12,248
我不跟你吵
I'll not argue.

140
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,051
 哎唷！ 对不起
 Ouch!  Sorry.

141
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:20,142
 你要冷静点  要我怎么冷静，这样都两个月了
 You need to calm down.  How can I be calm? Two months of this.

142
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:23,864
 你剪完了没有？ 你能不能坐着别动？
 Aren't you done yet?  Will you sit still?

143
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,006
你这样一副苦脸可抓不住一个好看的新丈夫
Won't catch a pretty new husband with a sour face like that.

144
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:30,988
我不要一个新丈夫，我要卡瑞多
I don't want a new husband. I want Crito.

145
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:32,669
你不能还跟一个牲畜贩子结婚
You can't stay married to a drover,

146
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,740
如今你爸爸可是个高级武官
not now that your father's a prefect.

147
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,331
 这样不合适  我告诉过她了
 It wouldn't be right.  I told her.

148
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:39,573
他差的太远了，你运气好，幸亏还没付嫁妆
Far too low. Fortune blessed you, you haven't paid out dowry.

149
00:10:39,603 --> 00:10:42,954
别着急，我们会给你找个好的
Don't worry, we'll find you someone nice,

150
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:45,506
 有合适的身份地位  我什么都不想要
 and proper status.  I don't want anyone!

151
00:10:45,536 --> 00:10:48,267
你这样的年纪不能不结婚，这样不体面
You can't be unmarried. It wouldn't be decent at your age.

152
00:10:48,307 --> 00:10:51,589
 她说体面  你这是什么意思？
 Decent she says.  What's that supposed to mean?

153
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:53,890
你知道是什么意思
You know what it means.

154
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,472
 你给我把嘴巴闭上  不然怎么样？
 You hold your tongue.  Or what?

155
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:59,823
你能怎么样？
What will you do?

156
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:06,677
没事的，甜心，没事的
It's all right, sweetie. It's all right.

157
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:13,341
有一阵，我还以为事情会好，但现在
I thought it was going well for a while, but now...

158
00:11:18,603 --> 00:11:21,085
也许我应该揍她，你说呢？
Maybe I should beat her, do you think?

159
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:26,097
我不知道，只有坚持才会有效果
I don't know. That only works if you keep at it.

160
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,369
每天好好地抽她们一两顿
A good thrashing once or twice a day

161
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,581
直到听话为止
till they're docile.

162
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:31,891
不过这样，她们就不好看了
But then they don't look so good.

163
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:34,912
把她这样的美人打的伤痕累累可不好
Be a shame to mark up a beauty like her.

164
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:40,175
她是啊？
She is, eh?

165
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:45,028
她是个美人
She's a beauty.

166
00:11:45,098 --> 00:11:46,959
她是的
She is that.

167
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:49,650
我给她奴隶，钱，所有的东西，可我得到什么？
I give her slaves, money, everything. What do I get?

168
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,722
什么也没有
Nothing, that's what.

169
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,258
这就是我得到的一屋子的哀怨声
I get a house full of wailing.

170
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,873
我妻子甚至不愿和我行房事
My wife won't even couple with me.

171
00:11:58,145 --> 00:11:59,645
为什么？
Why not?

172
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:01,897
她说不行，因为她妹妹住在这里
Says she can't while her sister stays.

173
00:12:01,927 --> 00:12:02,877
有她妹妹什么事？
What's her sister to do with it?

174
00:12:02,927 --> 00:12:04,888
这有什么关系？
What difference should that make?

175
00:12:15,724 --> 00:12:17,755
她怎么了？
What is wrong with her?

176
00:12:18,015 --> 00:12:19,896
她有什么问题？
What is wrong with her?

177
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,308
我做错什么了
What is wrong with me

178
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:24,709
要让这样对待我
that I'm served this way?

179
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:26,100
也许你该离开她
You should leave her, maybe,

180
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,251
既然她让你如此难过
seeing as she makes you so unhappy.

181
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:31,953
不！我不会离开她
No! I will not leave her.

182
00:12:36,805 --> 00:12:39,857
我宁愿死也不愿离开她
I'd rather die than leave her.

183
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:55,365
没事了，小羊羔
It's all right, lamb.

184
00:12:55,405 --> 00:12:57,476
会好起来的
It'll be all right.

185
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,751
我说，什么人
Who, I say,

186
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:09,933
面对我在这里列举的
faced with the overwhelming force

187
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:12,864
这些数字和论据的强大说服力
of the figures and the arguments I have here marshalled

188
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:17,027
还能不同意这一压倒性的结论？
could resist their overwhelming conclusion?

189
00:13:17,077 --> 00:13:20,979
因此我请求你们
Therefore I ask you,

190
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:23,670
尊敬的参议员们
honored conscript fathers,

191
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,552
支持我，通过这项重要的和…
to support me in this important and...

192
00:13:28,603 --> 00:13:32,415
和爱国主义的立法，它将…
patriotic legislation which will--

193
00:13:36,877 --> 00:13:42,400
有人想对这一倡议提出反对意见吗？
Does anyone wish to speak against the motion?

194
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:50,334
没有反对意见，不用投票表决
No opposition voiced. No division required.

195
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,476
提议通过
Motion carried.

196
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:03,712
空的
Empty.

197
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,934
如果没有酒了，水就行了
If there's no wine, water will do.

198
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,361
谢谢你，我的小鸽子
Thank you, my dove.

199
00:14:23,152 --> 00:14:25,723
莱蒂，你知道，我到处打听过了
So, Lyde, I was asking around, you know,

200
00:14:25,763 --> 00:14:28,125
关于你的男人伊万德的下落
about your man there, Evander.

201
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:29,555
四处打听？
Asking around?

202
00:14:29,595 --> 00:14:32,447
看看能不能帮你找到点线索
See if I could find out anything for you.

203
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:35,028
只有我才认识几个黑道上的人
Only, I know a few shady characters see?

204
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:38,350
那种人也许知道一个人失踪了到底是怎么回事
Types that might know what's what when a man's gone missing.

205
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:42,312
反正，他们告诉我说
Anyroad, they tell me

206
00:14:42,342 --> 00:14:45,274
他惹上了点麻烦
that he got himself into some trouble

207
00:14:45,324 --> 00:14:48,095
是跟河对面的一些希腊小混混
with some nasty Greek boys across the river.

208
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,967
 他们说是赌债  赌博？
 Gambling debts they say.  Gambling?

209
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:53,068
伊万德从不赌博
Evander never gambled.

210
00:14:53,098 --> 00:14:54,929
当然，这样的事情
Well sure, it's the sort of thing

211
00:14:54,969 --> 00:14:58,091
一个男人是不会跟他的妻子提起的，对不对？
a man keeps quiet around his wife, isn't it?

212
00:15:00,252 --> 00:15:02,193
你的意思是？
What are you saying?

213
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:06,395
我很抱歉这么跟你说，但是看样子他是不会回来了
I'm sorry to say it, but it looks like he's not coming home.

214
00:15:06,435 --> 00:15:08,416
看样子是死了
Dead, looks like.

215
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:10,797
你确定？
Are you sure?

216
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:12,750
他们是这么告诉我的，
So they tell me.

217
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,575
死了，被杀了
Dead. Killed.

218
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,801
这不是真的
It isn't true.

219
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:22,003
我的意见是
My advice,

220
00:15:22,164 --> 00:15:23,604
最好忘记他
best forget about him.

221
00:15:23,624 --> 00:15:26,266
最好继续过你自己的生活
Best get on with your life.

222
00:15:26,306 --> 00:15:28,397
这不是真的
It isn't true.

223
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:30,598
这也不算太坏
It's not so bad.

224
00:15:30,618 --> 00:15:32,219
你身边还有很多爱你的人
You've still got people that love you.

225
00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:34,070
看看他们
Look to them, eh?

226
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,391
内奥比，你说是不是
Isn't that right Niobe?

227
00:15:36,421 --> 00:15:38,872
她最好坚强活下去
Best she gets on with her life.

228
00:15:38,892 --> 00:15:41,464
为了那些爱她的人
Best she looks to the people that love her.

229
00:15:44,836 --> 00:15:49,838
忘记伊万德，忘记过去
Forget Evander. Forget the past.

230
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:56,222
好了，我走了
Well, I'm away.

231
00:15:56,252 --> 00:15:59,604
得去喝两杯为这一整天提提神
Need a drop of wine to set me up for the day.

232
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:20,164
莱蒂，请别这样
Lyde, please don't.

233
00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:27,168
我真难过，对不起
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

234
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,209
你抱歉？
You're sorry?

235
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,641
现在说抱歉太晚了，不是吗？
It's too late for sorry, isn't it?

236
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:33,622
你跟他上床的时候怎么不知道对不起？
You weren't sorry when you were fucking him, were you?

237
00:16:33,662 --> 00:16:36,163
你那个时候不知道抱歉，我去你妈的抱歉
You weren't sorry then. I piss on your sorrow!

238
00:16:36,193 --> 00:16:38,024
 我不会，嘘  你
 Shh!  I will not shh. You shh!

239
00:16:38,054 --> 00:16:41,076
你是个贼，是个婊子，你偷走了我的丈夫
You're a thief and a whore and you stole my husband!

240
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:43,497
我什么也没偷，是他来找我的
I stole nothing! He came to me!

241
00:16:43,517 --> 00:16:46,248
他来找我，我从来就没有爱过他，我爱我的丈夫
He came to me! I never loved him. I love my husband!

242
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:49,260
要是你…如果你是…
And if you'd done- if you'd been--

243
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,272
如果我怎么样？
If I had done what?

244
00:16:53,032 --> 00:16:56,324
如果我能给他生个小孩，对不对？
If I had given him a child. Is that it?

245
00:16:56,364 --> 00:16:58,785
对不起，请原谅我，请原谅我
I am sorry. Please forgive me. Please forgive me!

246
00:16:58,825 --> 00:17:02,027
 原谅我！ 我诅咒你，姐姐
 Forgive me!  I curse you, sister.

247
00:17:02,027 --> 00:17:06,169
以复仇女神的名义起誓，我诅咒你
By grace of the Furies, I curse you.

248
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:12,572
我会替你保守秘密
I'll keep your secret

249
00:17:12,623 --> 00:17:15,224
看在孩子的份上
for the sake of the child,

250
00:17:15,264 --> 00:17:17,695
但从今以后你…
but don't you ever...

251
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:21,227
你再也不要跟我说一句话
ever speak to me again.

252
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,951
小心
Be careful!

253
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,009
Ah!

254
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,980
精彩，精彩
Bravo. Bravo.

255
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,551
一点嗜血欲望很适合你，屋大维
A little blood lust suits you, Octavian.

256
00:18:06,591 --> 00:18:08,122
他很英俊吧，是不是？
You look very handsome. Does he not?

257
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:11,114
 是的  泰特斯·波罗是个好老师
 He does.  Titus Pullo is a good teacher.

258
00:18:11,154 --> 00:18:13,015
很遗憾恺撒不在这里
Well it's a pity Caesar isn't here.

259
00:18:13,065 --> 00:18:16,337
不然他会立刻把你编入他的军队里
He'd put you on his staff immediately.

260
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:18,888
也许你该到希腊去加入他
Perhaps you should go and join him in Greece,

261
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:21,389
让你的剑沾点儿真正的庞贝的血
get some real Pompeian blood on your sword.

262
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:23,660
 别说傻话了，母亲  为什么不？
 Don't be silly, Mother.  Well why not?

263
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,062
要是我们不赶快，庞贝和卡托，还有那些傻瓜们
If we are not quick, Pompey and Cato and all those fools

264
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:29,564
在屋大维崭露头角之前就死掉了
will be dead before Octavian gets his chance to shine.

265
00:18:29,604 --> 00:18:31,395
 他还是个孩子  我不是
 He's still a child.  I am not.

266
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:32,945
他不是，他现在是个实足的小男子汉了
He is not. He is quite the little man now.

267
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:36,557
我认为长大成人可不仅仅是会舞剑
I should think there's more to manhood than swordplay.

268
00:18:37,568 --> 00:18:39,209
屋大维
Octavian,

269
00:18:39,249 --> 00:18:41,420
 你有没有和女子交欢过？ 母亲，你…
 have you penetrated anyone yet?  Mother, please.

270
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,662
 这是说你有过还是没有？ 还没有，不过…
 Does that mean you have or haven't?  Haven't, but--

271
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:47,253
泰特斯·波罗，我不是交待过你办这件事吗？
Titus Pullo, didn't I tell you to sort that out?

272
00:18:47,273 --> 00:18:48,934
我肯定我说过的
I'm sure I did.

273
00:18:48,984 --> 00:18:51,946
我…对不起，夫人，我会负责办的
I- sorry, ma'am. I'll see to it.

274
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:53,616
这就去办
Do that.

275
00:18:53,857 --> 00:18:56,688
别担心，亲爱的，这真没什么难的
Don't worry, darling. There's really nothing to it.

276
00:18:56,748 --> 00:18:59,159
就好像是，只要你坐上了马鞍
Once you're in the saddle, as it were,

277
00:18:59,189 --> 00:19:01,751
一切都来的自然了，对不对，波罗
it'll all come naturally. Isn't that right, Pullo?

278
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:02,821
是的，夫人
That's right ma'am.

279
00:19:02,861 --> 00:19:06,743
我提醒你，不要你们那些臭当兵的找的那种母夜叉一样的人
And none of your sordid soldier's she-wolves, mind you.

280
00:19:06,743 --> 00:19:08,745
要干净，漂亮的
Something clean and pretty.

281
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:11,246
 是，干净，漂亮的  好
 Clean and pretty it is.  Good.

282
00:19:11,246 --> 00:19:13,337
我让玛茹拉给你做件外袍
I'll get Merula make you a toga. What else?

283
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:16,198
 还有什么？ 也许你能安排他杀一个人？
Perhaps you can arrange he kill someone.

284
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:19,740
适当的时候，会的
that will happen in due course.

285
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,992
我们优利亚家的人总少不了敌人
We Julii always have the needful enemies.

286
00:19:35,699 --> 00:19:37,710
保佑我的孩子健康
Health to my child.

287
00:19:39,431 --> 00:19:41,112
为我的女儿
My daughter.

288
00:19:42,062 --> 00:19:45,064
我想要个儿子，一个健康的男孩
I wish for a son, a healthy son.

289
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:15,870
 我，呃… 那么，晚安
 l, uh-  Good night, then.

290
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,523
晚安
Good night.

291
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,109
Husband.

292
00:20:49,108 --> 00:20:50,659
丈夫
What's all this?

293
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,680
这是干什么？

294
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,493
我想如果我们有些独处的时间，你可能会喜欢
I thought it might please you if we had some time alone.

295
00:20:59,544 --> 00:21:02,585
我把姑娘们和卢西尔斯送到克莱蕊莎那去了
I sent the girls and Lucius to Clarissa.

296
00:21:05,717 --> 00:21:08,258
 莱蒂呢？ 她到一个朋友家去了
 And Lyde?  She's gone to a friend's.

297
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,322
 请坐下  我已经吃过了
 Please, sit down.  I've already eaten.

298
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,843
不过…
But--

299
00:21:18,854 --> 00:21:21,155
我还可以再吃点
I can have some more.

300
00:21:25,578 --> 00:21:27,429
对不起
Excuse me.

301
00:21:55,654 --> 00:21:57,855
和我一起坐
Sit down with me.

302
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:00,216
 没关系  真的，坐
 That's all right.  Really, sit.

303
00:22:00,256 --> 00:22:02,347
我一个人也吃不完这所有的东西
I can't finish all this on my own.

304
00:22:50,283 --> 00:22:52,954
日期刚好…
The calendar is correct...

305
00:22:55,726 --> 00:22:58,797
如果你今晚愿意要我的话
if you would like to have me tonight.

306
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:03,370
我愿意
I would.

307
00:23:04,961 --> 00:23:06,982
我很愿意
I'd like that.

308
00:24:59,992 --> 00:25:01,633
我亲爱的马克·安东尼
My dear Mark Antony,

309
00:25:01,673 --> 00:25:02,905
希望你收到这封信时身体健康，
I hope this finds you in better health

310
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:05,077
这更胜于我对胜利的渴望
than my hopes for victory.

311
00:25:05,445 --> 00:25:07,906
我追赶庞贝从希腊的这一头到那一头
I chased Pompey from one end of Greece to the other

312
00:25:07,947 --> 00:25:10,738
而他完全拒绝于我开战
and he resolutely refused to fight.

313
00:25:10,908 --> 00:25:13,079
我原认为这是他一贯的愚蠢作风
I thought this was his usual obtuseness,

314
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:16,731
可是这老家伙还不算那么糊涂
but the old man has some sense left in him yet.

315
00:25:20,523 --> 00:25:21,874
他一边逃避开战
While avoiding battle,

316
00:25:21,914 --> 00:25:24,645
同时从东部纠集了十个兵团的人马
he has gathered a good 10 legions from the east,

317
00:25:24,685 --> 00:25:28,297
这就大大超过了我方的军队人数
and I find myself badly outnumbered.

318
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,611
现在猫冲着狗叫嚣
Now the cat barks at the dog,

319
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:38,473
庞贝掉转头来追我了
and Pompey is chasing me.

320
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,558
我可以以策略致胜他一时
I can outmaneuver him for a while,

321
00:25:48,598 --> 00:25:50,879
但不能一世
but not forever.

322
00:25:53,611 --> 00:25:55,412
我的人马既疲倦，粮草又不足
My men are tired and ill-supplied,

323
00:25:55,412 --> 00:25:58,313
而且我们很快就不得不停下来，跟他开战
and we shall soon have to stand and fight.

324
00:25:58,313 --> 00:26:03,906
我要你火速把13军团带过来
I ask you to bring the 13th here as speedily as you are able.

325
00:26:17,564 --> 00:26:19,325
该死的！
Damnation.

326
00:26:19,365 --> 00:26:22,356
宣军团来使吗？
Shall I summon the legion legates?

327
00:26:24,437 --> 00:26:26,809
不，等等
No. Wait.

328
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:29,940
我得考虑一下
I must think on this.

329
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:35,843
这个真好看
This is lovely.

330
00:26:35,974 --> 00:26:37,985
哦，这正是你的颜色
 Oh.  Oh, it's just your coloring.

331
00:26:38,025 --> 00:26:41,076
夸张了点，我喜欢简单的东西
A little loud. I'd prefer something plainer.

332
00:26:41,106 --> 00:26:43,728
简单有什么好，这个我们要了
What's the point in plain? We shall take it.

333
00:26:45,198 --> 00:26:47,680
戴这个看看…
But this one...

334
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:54,834
美极了，哦，美极了
Divine. Oh, divine.

335
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:58,986
安东尼会喜欢这个，他喜欢看我打扮成东方风格
Antony will love this. He likes me in Eastern styles.

336
00:26:59,086 --> 00:27:01,857
 两个一起多少钱？ 五千
 How much for both?  5,000.

337
00:27:01,897 --> 00:27:05,009
 你不如去偷吧  那么四千五
 You are a thief.  Four and a half then.

338
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:07,150
三千
Three.

339
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,392
这么多钱我们付得起吗？
Can we afford such expense?

340
00:27:10,432 --> 00:27:12,253
照恺撒在希腊的情形看
Things as they are with Caesar in Greece,

341
00:27:12,293 --> 00:27:14,224
我们不应该更谨慎些吗？
surely we should be more prudent?

342
00:27:14,264 --> 00:27:16,005
一点都不用担心，我亲爱的
Don't worry about a thing my dear,

343
00:27:16,045 --> 00:27:18,616
我早想好了
I'm thinking ahead.

344
00:27:19,247 --> 00:27:21,508
泰特斯·波罗来了，少爷
Titus Pullo is here, dominus.

345
00:27:21,548 --> 00:27:26,751
哦，告诉他我不舒服
Oh. Tell him I am unwell.

346
00:27:26,841 --> 00:27:28,442
要么让他下个星期再来
He may come back next week perhaps.

347
00:27:28,462 --> 00:27:31,043
别跟他说这些
Tell him nothing of the sort.

348
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,344
告诉他，屋大维过一会就见他
Octavian will be ready to see him in one moment.

349
00:27:33,374 --> 00:27:35,695
再给他一袋钱
And give him a purse.

350
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:38,067
亲爱的，你已经拖得够久的了
You've put off this moment long enough, my dear.

351
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:38,467
母亲
Mother--

352
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:40,670
你今天必须去找个女孩子交欢
You will penetrate someone today or I will

353
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,609
不然我就把你的破书都烧了
burn your wretched books in the yard.

354
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,371
你下去吧
Off with you.

355
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,009
借过，有贵族过来了，让路
Coming through. Noble coming through. Make way there.

356
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:17,348
别担心，少爷，这不算什么的
Don't worry, young master. There's nothing to it.

357
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:20,539
要是没什么，为什么搞得这么大惊小怪的？
If there is nothing to it, why is such a fuss made of the thing?

358
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,511
你很快就知道了
You'll soon find out.

359
00:28:33,386 --> 00:28:35,247
去，去，你给我出去！
vai, vai! Be off with you!

360
00:28:35,287 --> 00:28:37,739
这儿可不是兵团的妓寨，谢谢，请走
This isn't no infantry fuckhole, thank you very much.

361
00:28:37,769 --> 00:28:40,080
不，甜心，别动肝火
Now now, my honey, calm your stomach.

362
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,281
我们来是为了这位年轻的少爷
We've come for the young master here.

363
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,522
我们有的是钱
Andwe'rewell coind.

364
00:28:44,552 --> 00:28:48,274
哦，好吧，请你一定别介意
Oh well, excuse me, of course.

365
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:49,845
我不是故意无礼的
I meant no disrespect.

366
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:52,727
我们很荣幸为你效劳，少爷
We're honored to service you, young master.

367
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:56,859
年轻的少爷喜欢什么样的呢？
And what would be the young master's pleasure?

368
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:01,881
他是第一次，找个好点的
First timer. Nothing too savory.

369
00:29:03,322 --> 00:29:06,624
我保证我们有你中意的
I'm sure we have just the thing.

370
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:18,550
一点异国情调，如何？
Something exotic, perhaps?

371
00:29:20,271 --> 00:29:22,562
要么年轻点的？
Or else something young?

372
00:29:22,612 --> 00:29:25,664
清秀，天真
Light, simple.

373
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:29,046
太瘦了点，是不是？
Little bit skinny, isn't it?

374
00:29:29,086 --> 00:29:31,537
完了他都不会有感觉，是不是？
Won't know he's been, will he?

375
00:29:31,577 --> 00:29:33,949
你都不会有感觉的
Won't know you've been.

376
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:36,940
这个丰满些
More substance,

377
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,672
可仍是个美少女
yet still nymphlike,

378
00:29:39,702 --> 00:29:42,313
很优雅
graceful.

379
00:29:44,254 --> 00:29:47,196
这个是刚从船上运到的…
This one's fresh off the boat...

380
00:29:47,236 --> 00:29:49,947
 就那个吧  慢着，少爷
 That will be fine.  Hold on, young master.

381
00:29:49,977 --> 00:29:51,708
No point hurrying.

382
00:29:51,728 --> 00:29:53,719
这可是个重大的决定
Big decision, this.

383
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:56,351
 让我们看看… 这个已经足够了
 Let's have a look at-  This one is perfectly adequate.

384
00:29:56,391 --> 00:29:59,902
我保证，一定让你完全满意
You will be utterly satisfied, I assure you.

385
00:29:59,962 --> 00:30:03,544
依吉莉娅，你去准备一下
Egeria, go prepare yourself.

386
00:30:03,774 --> 00:30:08,287
如果我们能把钱的问题先清一下…
If we might dispense with the pecuniary details...

387
00:30:08,847 --> 00:30:11,048
 呃？ 哦，好的
Oh, right.

388
00:30:11,088 --> 00:30:14,280
 你要什么价  一千
 What's your price then?  1,000.

389
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,861
什么！？
Gerrae!

390
00:30:15,891 --> 00:30:18,582
这个价我可以把纳波一半的妓女都睡了，再加上她们的老妈
I could have half the whores in Narbo for that, and their mothers.

391
00:30:18,612 --> 00:30:22,464
我们可不是在纳波 我管你那是什么
We're not in Narbo, whatever that might be.

392
00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:24,726
好吧，我的鸽子
All right, mydove.

393
00:30:24,766 --> 00:30:26,747
我们给
We'll pay.

394
00:30:27,637 --> 00:30:30,659
但那个女孩最好像特洛伊里的海伦一样使出她的看家本事伺候他
But the girl better fuck him like Helen of Troy with her ass on fire,

395
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:33,210
否则我要你好看
or I'll know the reason why.

396
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:49,219
 说话  格涅乌斯·庞贝·麦格纳斯送来他的问候
 Speak.  Gnaeus Pompey Magnus sends greetings.

397
00:30:49,239 --> 00:30:52,280
希望你在他的房子里住的还满意
He hopes you find his house satisfactory.

398
00:30:52,671 --> 00:30:54,682
马马虎虎
It'll do.

399
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:57,883
 说他的重点  他的重点
 Get to his point.  His point.

400
00:30:58,434 --> 00:31:00,905
恺撒注定要失败的，而你和他一起
Caesar is doomed and you with him,

401
00:31:00,945 --> 00:31:04,667
 除非你庞贝单独讲和  还有呢？
 unless you make a separate peace.  And?

402
00:31:06,418 --> 00:31:09,299
如果你这样做，庞贝就对你手下留情，不与你计较
If you do, Pompey will be merciful and generous.

403
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:10,770
怎么个留情法？
How?

404
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,392
他会留你的性命，再给你一个省
He will give you your life. A province.

405
00:31:13,432 --> 00:31:16,403
和足够的钱来保证你的尊严
Money enough to preserve your dignity.

406
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:22,196
是什么让他觉得我会把我自己的性命看得这么值钱？
What makes him think I value my life so high?

407
00:31:22,276 --> 00:31:25,028
那你为什么还没有去希腊呢？
Why have you not left for Greece?

408
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:29,290
别跟我笑
Do not smile at me.

409
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,163
明天再来，到时我会给庞贝一个答复
Return tomorrow. I will give Pompey his answer then.

410
00:31:36,274 --> 00:31:38,965
不是那边
Not that way.

411
00:31:43,928 --> 00:31:46,509
别让人看见你
And disguiseyourself.

412
00:32:02,468 --> 00:32:04,889
下去吧
Dismissed.

413
00:32:15,845 --> 00:32:18,737
你把衣服脱下来？
You take clothes down?

414
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:22,048
你的口音真好笑
That's an interesting accent.

415
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,441
不懂
No understand.

416
00:32:30,203 --> 00:32:32,004
哪里…
Where--

417
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:35,255
你从哪里来？
are you from?

418
00:32:35,435 --> 00:32:38,087
哦，哪里来的
Oh. Where from.

419
00:32:38,227 --> 00:32:39,688
不知道
Don't know.

420
00:32:39,718 --> 00:32:42,439
你不知道自己是哪里人？
You don't know where you're from?

421
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:49,053
罗马很小就把我带走了
Rome take me very young.

422
00:32:49,053 --> 00:32:53,875
杀了妈妈，爸爸，弟弟
Kill mother, father, brother,

423
00:32:53,935 --> 00:32:56,227
把我带走了
take me.

424
00:32:57,147 --> 00:33:00,179
哦，我明白了，可怜
Oh. I see. Sad.

425
00:33:18,068 --> 00:33:19,739
你背过去，行吗？
Turn over, would you?

426
00:33:25,752 --> 00:33:29,173
趴到床上
On your hands and knees.

427
00:33:36,563 --> 00:33:38,554
Ah!

428
00:33:43,631 --> 00:33:45,522
这地方不错
Nice place, this.

429
00:33:45,572 --> 00:33:47,203
干净
Clean.

430
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:54,297
我想我没有
I don't suppose,

431
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,538
这个资格在这儿…
seeing as I'm with the quality...

432
00:33:56,588 --> 00:33:59,129
一点也没有
Not a chance.

433
00:34:06,553 --> 00:34:09,885
不，不，来真的，真打
No no no. No, do it for real. Fight.

434
00:34:13,847 --> 00:34:16,799
哦，来呀，真打，该死的，打！
Oh, come on, fight, damn you! Fight!

435
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:18,810
这样好多了！
That's better!

436
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,891
嗯，好
Mmm, good.

437
00:34:29,045 --> 00:34:31,547
好啊，辛西娅，精彩！
Brava, Cynthia! Brava!

438
00:34:31,717 --> 00:34:37,160
哦，傻丫头，这不过是点擦伤
Oh, don't be so silly, it's just a scratch now.

439
00:34:40,772 --> 00:34:42,413
没事，没事
There there.

440
00:34:43,543 --> 00:34:45,034
波斯卡，到底什么事？
Yes, Posca, what is it?

441
00:34:45,064 --> 00:34:49,947
我是来提醒你，你和优利亚家的阿提娅约好今晚共进晚餐
I am to remind you of your dinner tonight with Atia of the Julii.

442
00:34:50,787 --> 00:34:53,288
他妈的！
Sons of Dis.

443
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,351
走吧
Now, run along.

444
00:34:59,422 --> 00:35:02,093
他在哪？他到哪去了？
Where is he? Where can he be?

445
00:35:02,173 --> 00:35:03,844
大忙人，他要搞政治
Busy man. Politics.

446
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:06,015
政治？他答应过我要来的
Politics? He promised he would come.

447
00:35:06,045 --> 00:35:07,806
卡斯特！
Castor!

448
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:10,929
派人到庞贝，
Send a man to Pompey's--

449
00:35:11,024 --> 00:35:13,350
我是说，马克·安东尼的住所，询问他的下落
I mean, Mark Antony's villa and enquire his whereabouts.

450
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,080
安东尼的下落，立刻就去，夫人
Antony's whereabouts, immediately, domina.

451
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,892
别说是我派人问的
Do not say it is I who sends to ask.

452
00:35:17,942 --> 00:35:20,143
不是你派人去问的
Not you sends to ask.

453
00:35:20,193 --> 00:35:22,264
慢着，他肯定会知道是我问的
Stay. He'll know it is I who asked.

454
00:35:22,284 --> 00:35:24,295
不用派人了
Send no one.

455
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,466
我不派人了
I will send no one.

456
00:35:26,506 --> 00:35:29,348
如果他来就来了，我才不在乎
If he comes, he comes, I don't care!

457
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,889
Halt!

458
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,512
欢迎驾到，老爷
Welcome, dominus.

459
00:36:24,337 --> 00:36:28,629
抱歉迟到得太晚了，公事没完没了
Sorry to be so horribly late. Endless business.

460
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,461
 你原谅我吗？ 当然
 Will you forgive me?  Of course.

461
00:36:31,511 --> 00:36:33,392
老实说，我几乎都不记得你要来了
I confess, I had quite forgotten you were coming.

462
00:36:33,422 --> 00:36:36,093
这还真是个意外的惊喜
So this is a lovely surprise.

463
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:39,625
失陪一下，我去换件像样的衣服
Excuse me a moment, I will go and dress correctly.

464
00:37:28,851 --> 00:37:30,062
他出来了
Mmm. Here he is,

465
00:37:30,102 --> 00:37:31,783
小太阳神
young Apollo!

466
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:32,984
怎么样？
 How was it?  It was pleasant.

467
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,385
很愉快

468
00:37:35,385 --> 00:37:38,887
愉快？我就说了
Pleasant? I should say so.

469
00:37:38,887 --> 00:37:43,189
 他怎么样？ 像头牛
 How was he?  Like bull.

470
00:38:10,274 --> 00:38:13,065
 怎么了？       没什么
What's wrong?   Nothing.

471
00:38:15,456 --> 00:38:17,387
告诉我
Tell me.

472
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:27,993
马克·安东尼不打算到希腊去援助恺撒
Mark Antony does not intend to go to Greece to help Caesar.

473
00:38:28,853 --> 00:38:32,265
我发誓效忠了一个不讲信义的人
I have sworn loyalty to a man of no honor.

474
00:38:33,596 --> 00:38:36,368
至少这样你就不用去希腊了啊
Well you don't have to go to Greece then.

475
00:38:36,718 --> 00:38:40,590
 我们就可以在一起了  是的，但还是
 We'll be together.  It's true, but still.

476
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,272
你不总说恺撒做的事不对吗？
Haven't you always said Caesar's cause is wrong?

477
00:38:45,722 --> 00:38:47,774
这个不是重点
That is not the point.

478
00:38:47,814 --> 00:38:51,616
这关系到道德原则
There is a moral principle involved.

479
00:38:55,828 --> 00:39:00,831
你真是个傻瓜
What an idiot you are!

480
00:39:12,637 --> 00:39:14,238
你不饿？
Not hungry?

481
00:39:14,238 --> 00:39:19,451
哦，在军队里喝了这么多年的稀粥，我现在很容易就满足了
Oh, after so many years of soldier's porridge, I am easily sated.

482
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:23,573
看来这从希腊来的最新消息
Well, this last news from Greece

483
00:39:23,613 --> 00:39:25,234
也没能给你增加点食欲
cannot have improved your appetite.

484
00:39:25,254 --> 00:39:26,406
没有
Hardly.

485
00:39:26,413 --> 00:39:29,310
真有这么糟吗？恺撒总能找到赢的办法
And is it really so bad? Caesar always finds a way to win.

486
00:39:29,376 --> 00:39:32,978
庞贝的人马是恺撒的十倍
Pompey has gathered 10 men for every one of Caesar's.

487
00:39:33,158 --> 00:39:35,729
这数字是不讲情面的
Arithmetic has no mercy.

488
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:38,070
我也担心是这样
I'd feared it was so.

489
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:41,582
那你打算怎么办？
What do you intend to do then?

490
00:39:50,227 --> 00:39:52,608
我不知道
I don't know.

491
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:59,362
你已经是一个有权势的人了，人民也爱戴你
You've become a powerful man. The people love you.

492
00:39:59,652 --> 00:40:01,413
这不过是因为他们不了解我
Only because they don't know me.

493
00:40:01,453 --> 00:40:04,925
要是你愿意，你可以成为罗马的第一人
You could be the first man in Rome, if you wanted.

494
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:08,147
我从没这么想过
I hadn't thought about it like that.

495
00:40:08,357 --> 00:40:10,628
那你应该…
Well, you should.

496
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:13,659
你该好好想想
You should think about that.

497
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:19,112
我在想一些截然不同的东西
I'm thinking about something entirely different.

498
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:21,624
Mmm.

499
00:40:47,868 --> 00:40:50,099
水
Water.

500
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:15,222
我能睡上一个星期
I could sleep for a week.

501
00:41:21,886 --> 00:41:24,077
我在想
I've been thinking.

502
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:30,761
我们应该结婚
We should get married.

503
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:35,203
结婚？
Married?

504
00:41:36,844 --> 00:41:40,076
我们为什么想要这么做？
Why should we want to do that of all things?

505
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:43,537
也许因为我爱你
 Perhaps I love you.  Ah.

506
00:41:44,488 --> 00:41:46,089
你在开玩笑
You're joking.

507
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:49,200
有那么一下，你还真吓着我了
For a moment there you had me worried.

508
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,582
我不是在跟你开玩笑
I am not joking with you.

509
00:41:52,482 --> 00:41:54,703
哦，我亲爱的女人哪！
Oh, my dear woman.

510
00:41:54,733 --> 00:41:58,275
别担心
Please don't worry,

511
00:41:58,305 --> 00:41:59,469
我不是想跟你装温柔
I'm not going soft on you.

512
00:41:59,499 --> 00:42:01,364
我是从战略上考虑
I'm thinking strategically.

513
00:42:01,547 --> 00:42:03,188
如果恺撒战败了
If Caesar is defeated,

514
00:42:03,218 --> 00:42:08,111
我不可能和庞贝一党结成良好的同盟
I can't very well form an alliance with the Pompeians.

515
00:42:08,431 --> 00:42:11,943
 我需要保护  对
 I need protection.  True.

516
00:42:14,094 --> 00:42:16,915
这有我什么事？
What's in it for me?

517
00:42:17,175 --> 00:42:18,996
如果恺撒战败了…
If Caesar is defeated--

518
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,847
那我也同样战败了
Then I will be defeated also.

519
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:23,269
除非你到希腊去加入他
Only if you join him in Greece.

520
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:25,580
但如果你留在罗马
But if you stay in Rome,

521
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,491
你将会有很好地位
you will be very well situated.

522
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:29,512
人民站在你一边
You have the people with you,

523
00:42:29,562 --> 00:42:31,673
这个城市也是属于你的
you have possession of the city.

524
00:42:31,723 --> 00:42:33,524
你缺的只是钱
You only lack money.

525
00:42:33,544 --> 00:42:35,785
同时人们也非常尊敬你的名字…
And whilst your name is perfectly respectable--

526
00:42:35,825 --> 00:42:38,667
 我不是贵族  正是
 I am no patrician.  Exactly.

527
00:42:38,727 --> 00:42:41,829
可是一旦和我的家族结合，你就既有了钱，也有了贵族身份
But allied with my house, you would have both coin and nobility

528
00:42:41,879 --> 00:42:44,490
要是你愿意，你还可以称王
to make yourself king if you wished it so.

529
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,631
而你就是王后
And you would be queen.

530
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:50,563
我会是爱你的，顺从你的妻子
I would be your loving and obedient wife.

531
00:42:51,124 --> 00:42:54,395
只要我愿意背弃一个朋友
If only I were willing to desert a friend.

532
00:42:54,425 --> 00:42:56,346
一个和你同血缘的人
A man of your own blood.

533
00:42:56,386 --> 00:42:59,958
 哦，你太高尚了，这不适合你，是吗？  我希望我表面上是的
 Oh, too honorable for that, are you?  I like to appear so.

534
00:42:59,988 --> 00:43:03,720
可我不认为你会为了面子而死
But I don't think you'll die for the sake of appearances.

535
00:43:06,802 --> 00:43:10,554
 我不会吗？ 恺撒不管怎么样都会死的
 Will I not?  Caesar will die in any case.

536
00:43:10,584 --> 00:43:15,006
但你很聪明，不会无端端地陪他去送死的
But you are far too clever to share his fate needlessly.

537
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,071
我知道现在才意识到…
I had not realized until now...

538
00:43:24,491 --> 00:43:29,434
你原来是个多么邪恶的老女妖啊！
what a wicked old harpy you really are.

539
00:43:42,341 --> 00:43:44,182
滚出去！
Get out!

540
00:43:45,242 --> 00:43:47,444
给我滚！
Get out!

541
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:06,544
谢谢你，波罗
Thank you, Pullo.

542
00:44:09,035 --> 00:44:11,526
立正！
Atattention!

543
00:44:46,533 --> 00:44:49,127
Ow.

544
00:45:07,136 --> 00:45:09,297
大白天的能在床上躺着，多奢侈啊
Abed in daylight, what luxury.

545
00:45:09,327 --> 00:45:11,278
不道德吗？
Wickedness.

546
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:16,241
父亲，那个侏儒来找你
Father, that dwarf is asking for you.

547
00:45:18,092 --> 00:45:19,513
马克·安东尼阁下
Excellency Mark Antony

548
00:45:19,563 --> 00:45:22,004
下令13军团在到战神之地去集合
orders 13th Legion to muster on the Field of Mars.

549
00:45:22,034 --> 00:45:25,106
 为什么？我们要上哪儿去？ 希腊
 Why? Where are we going?  Greece.

550
00:45:55,732 --> 00:45:57,423
护民官！
Tribune!

551
00:45:58,674 --> 00:46:01,705
我应该怎么答复庞贝？
 What shall I tell Pompey?  Oh!

552
00:46:01,755 --> 00:46:03,806
当然
Of course.

553
00:46:03,846 --> 00:46:07,008
对不起，我把你给忘了
Excuse me. I had forgot you.

554
00:46:32,512 --> 00:46:34,063
他的皮肤有点干燥
His skin is a little dry.

555
00:46:34,093 --> 00:46:37,555
把他送出去之前，好好给他上点油
Have him well-oiled before he is presented.

556
00:46:37,725 --> 00:46:39,286
哦，天哪！
Bona dea.

557
00:46:39,316 --> 00:46:43,678
 我怕这个是…？  给赛维莉娅的礼物
 I am afraid to ask.  Gifts for Servilia.

558
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:50,682
你真帅，让我好好看看
How fine you look. Let me see.

559
00:46:51,412 --> 00:46:55,324
我太为你骄傲了，你终于成了一个真正的男人了
I am so proud of you. You're a real man at last, eh?

560
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,095
我们为什么要给赛维莉娅送礼？
Why are we giving gifts to Servilia?

561
00:46:57,125 --> 00:47:00,247
那只老乌鸦和卡托，还有其他人关系挺好
The old crow stands in well with Cato and the rest.

562
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:02,388
当恺撒和他的走狗马克·安东尼战败的时候…
 When Caesar and his dog Antony are defeated--

563
00:47:02,428 --> 00:47:03,780
 如果他们会失败的话
 If they are defeated.

564
00:47:03,837 --> 00:47:06,938
当他们失败的时候  我们得要让她帮忙说好话
When they are defeated, we'll need her good will.

565
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:09,692
 而你认为送这个可以收买她？ 我没觉得有什么不行
 And this will buy it, you think?  I do not see why not.

566
00:47:09,732 --> 00:47:12,503
又粗又长的玩意总是受欢迎的
A large penis is always welcome.

567
00:47:12,533 --> 00:47:14,845
 你觉得这还不够吗？ 在你对她做了的那些事情之后？
 You think it's not enough?  After what you did to her?

568
00:47:14,905 --> 00:47:18,577
 我做什么了？我对她做了什么了？ 别装蒜了，我又不傻
 What I did? What did I do to her?  Please! I'm not stupid.

569
00:47:18,607 --> 00:47:20,448
是你搞的让恺撒和她断绝关系的
It was you made Caesar renounce her.

570
00:47:20,478 --> 00:47:23,439
 就算是我做的，她又不知道  她会不知道？
 What if I did? She doesn't know it.  Does she not?

571
00:47:23,479 --> 00:47:27,111
 她也不傻啊  赛维莉亚人从不耍手段
 She's not stupid either.  Servilia has no guile in her.

572
00:47:27,151 --> 00:47:29,382
如果她知道了，我们肯定会听说的
If she knows it, we would certainly have heard about it.

573
00:47:29,432 --> 00:47:31,353
你自己最清楚了，我肯定
You know best, I'm sure.

574
00:47:31,393 --> 00:47:34,145
无论如何，我们要把这份礼给她
In any case, you will take the gifts to her

575
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:36,946
看她是怎么想的
and see what she's thinking.

576
00:47:36,996 --> 00:47:40,028
她一直很喜欢你
She's always been very fond of you.

577
00:47:40,968 --> 00:47:42,659
而你要到米狄欧兰侬（米兰）去
And you will go to Mediolanum.

578
00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:44,700
 泰门会送你去  米狄欧兰侬？
 Timon will take you.  Mediolanum?

579
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,491
是，他们在那儿有个很好的学院
Yes, they have a very good academy there.

580
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:49,263
 我不明白  你是个男人了
 I don't understand.  You're a man now.

581
00:47:49,303 --> 00:47:52,395
对优利亚家的男人来说罗马不再是个安全的地方
Rome's not safe for men of the Julii.

582
00:47:54,696 --> 00:47:56,827
他的脚趾甲太难看了
His toenails are ugly.

583
00:47:56,857 --> 00:47:59,588
让他们给他修剪一下，再上色，再给他头上戴点花
Have them cut and painted and put some flowers on his head.

584
00:47:59,628 --> 00:48:01,900
哦，送点冰过来，六桶吧
Oh, and send over some ice. Six barrels, say.

585
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:04,131
六桶冰
Six barrels of ice.

586
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:10,814
别傻看着
Well, don't look so foolish.

587
00:48:10,844 --> 00:48:13,436
我知道我在干什么
I know what I'm about.

588
00:48:22,341 --> 00:48:26,043
你母亲太客气了
Your mother's too kind.

589
00:48:27,353 --> 00:48:30,425
她送这么大方的礼，是要我用什么来还？
To what do I owe this generosity?

590
00:48:30,495 --> 00:48:33,877
这只一种出于友谊的表示
It's a gesture of friendship.

591
00:48:34,007 --> 00:48:36,188
友谊

592
00:48:36,228 --> 00:48:39,750
谢谢你母亲的…友谊

593
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:43,032
我希望有一天我能报答她的…
I hope one day to reciprocate her...

594
00:48:43,072 --> 00:48:45,503
友谊
friendship.

595
00:48:48,995 --> 00:48:51,126
那我走了
I will go then.

596
00:48:53,217 --> 00:48:56,039
对不起
Excuse me.

597
00:48:57,139 --> 00:48:58,870
等等
Wait.

598
00:49:00,181 --> 00:49:02,952
请原谅我的坏脾气
Please, forgive my ill humor.

599
00:49:03,783 --> 00:49:06,114
没什么要原谅的
There's nothing to forgive.

600
00:49:06,204 --> 00:49:11,067
你还是个小女孩的时候我就认识你了，你有一颗善良的心灵
I have known you since you were a little girl. You have a good soul.

601
00:49:11,257 --> 00:49:14,839
我知道不管别人做了什么
I know that whatever others might do,

602
00:49:14,899 --> 00:49:17,150
你是无辜的

603
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,941
这点我明白
I know that.

604
00:49:18,971 --> 00:49:21,432
我…我没有做，那是，我不能…
I- I do not- that is, I cannot--

605
00:49:21,462 --> 00:49:23,083
嘘，嘘
Shh shh shh shh.

606
00:49:23,123 --> 00:49:26,955
没关系，不用解释了
It's all right. There's no need.

607
00:49:30,927 --> 00:49:32,448
告诉你妈妈

608
00:49:32,508 --> 00:49:35,550
我很感谢她的礼物

我还是一如既往的珍惜和她的友谊

你一定要再来看我，好吗？

611
00:49:48,366 --> 00:49:51,958
 我会的  你保证？

我希望我们俩之间没有反感

00:50:12,059 --> 00:50:14,080
要听话

616
00:50:22,545 --> 00:50:24,926
我在外面等你

617
00:50:27,006 --> 00:50:28,997
Shh shh shh.

神后也保佑你

620
00:52:31,684 --> 00:52:34,785
一支舰队已经出发驶向希腊

621
00:52:34,815 --> 00:52:39,178
它满载着马克·安东尼将军的军队

622
00:52:39,808 --> 00:52:42,029
这个月的公共面包

制作纯正的罗马面包

00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:13,876
大难临头了，我全身都湿透了

628

我们安全的很！

629

已经向海神敬献过了丰厚的贡品
A very good offering was made to Triton!

630
00:53:17,818 --> 00:53:22,231
如果海神不能把我身上弄干点儿，那就见他的鬼去吧
If Triton can't keep me drier than this, he can suck my cock!

631
00:53:23,762 --> 00:53:27,203
你怎么学不会闭上你的臭嘴
Why can't you learn to keep your fat mouth shut?!

632

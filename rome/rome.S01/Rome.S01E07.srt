1
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:05,430
如果通过塞萨利撤退到岸边
Perhaps if we retreat to the coast via Thessaly

2
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,559
我们可以坚持到大雨来临的时候
we could hold out until the rains come.

3
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:10,618
如果我们往东边走，他们会在这拦截我们
If we go eastward, they'll be able to cut us off here.

4
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:12,688
噢，对…
Oh, of course.

5
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:14,547
这样行不通
It will not do.

6
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,489
准备好了
Ready.

7
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,014
如果你期待着地图给你想个法子出来
Maps never redraw themselves,

8
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:25,163
那我劝你还是早点打消这个念头吧
if that's what you're waiting for.

9
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,863
他说的对
He's right.

10
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:29,501
我们不如就在这里决一死战
We shall just have to fight the wretches here where we stand.

11
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:31,501
打败他们
And beatthem.

12
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:34,560
放心吧，我们会赢的
Oh, we shall crush them, doubtless.

13
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:39,558
兵不刃血，让他们都去死吧
Dinner for worms, the whole damn lot of 'em.

14
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:40,788
兵不刃血
Dinner for worms.

15
00:03:57,732 --> 00:04:00,591
这次可别刮出血来了
Try to avoid bloodshed this time.

16
00:04:00,661 --> 00:04:03,919
总比庞贝来为您刮好一些
Wait a while and Pompey can shave you instead.

17
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:06,588
托卡图斯应该有个一官半职
Torquatus should have something, no?

18
00:04:06,648 --> 00:04:08,618
当个执政官什么的
A Praetorship perhaps.

19
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:10,577
如果托卡图斯当上高官
If Torquatus is given high office,

20
00:04:10,647 --> 00:04:13,416
瓦罗也得给个官衔，否则有的可闹了
then varro must be given same, else we'll see no end of trouble.

21
00:04:13,476 --> 00:04:15,745
那么我们给莱比耶纳斯什么东西呢？
But then what do we give Labienus?

22
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:19,434
 马其顿？  比斯欣尼亚给他，马其顿给里伯
 Macedonia?  Bythnia. Macedonia to Libo.

23
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:22,663
厚此薄彼，徇私么？
Plums for your people and porridge for the rest, eh?

24
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:27,331
马其顿和比斯欣尼亚还不是我们的领土
Macedonia and Bythnia are not yet ours to bestow.

25
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:30,390
你这是在异想天开
You are cooking rabbits that have not been caught.

26
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,989
我们的猎物已经无路可退，饥肠辘辘
Our particular rabbit is cornered, starving,

27
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:35,848
损失了近2,000人
and has lost near 2,000 men.

28
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,577
我想我们可以这么说
I think we may safely say

29
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:41,346
这场仗是赢定了
that here is a rabbit ready for the pot.

30
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:46,534
 为什么闷闷不乐，布鲁图斯？  噢，是吗？
 Why so melancholy, Brutus?  Oh, do I seem so?

31
00:04:46,604 --> 00:04:48,164
请原谅
 Mmm.  Forgive me.

32
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:51,063
击败恺撒是无上的光荣
No, Caesar's defeat is a glory--

33
00:04:51,132 --> 00:04:55,061
我们已经不能再忍受暴政了 但我高兴不起来
we cannot endure tyrants- but I cannot celebrate it.

34
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:58,160
他对我来说如同父亲
He was as my father to me.

35
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,819
我同情你，我们什么时候进攻？
I feel for you. When do we strike?

36
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:03,848
进攻？进攻早就开始了
Strike? We have already struck.

37
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:06,077
我们包围了他，但他还没死，不是吗？
We have him down, but he is not dead yet, eh?

38
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:09,276
 我们什么时候给他最后的一击？  我们不会
 When do we strike the final blow?  There will not be one.

39
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:12,705
我们只需要继续困住他一个月
If we simply keep him bottled up a month or so more,

40
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:16,633
他剩下的部队就会彻底崩溃
the remains of his army will disintegrate and disappear,

41
00:05:16,703 --> 00:05:18,593
 不需要我们出手  这样做有什么荣誉可言？
 at no cost to us.  Is that honorable?

42
00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:21,022
恺撒迫使我们离开罗马
 Mmm?  Caesar has driven us from Rome,

43
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:24,491
让我们背井离乡，杀害我们的朋友
chased us out of ltaly, killed our friends,

44
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:26,420
霸占我们的国家
usurped our Republic.

45
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,819
屈辱必须用血才能洗清
Surely, dignity and honor demands we walk in his blood.

46
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:31,117
 完全同意
Certainly, knee deep.

47
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,755
但你却让饥饿为我们代劳
But you would have hunger do our work for us!

48
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:37,276
我们应该主动进攻把恺撒活活的烧死
We must attack Caesar and kill him under the eyes of Mars,

49
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,314
 否则胜利毫无意义  他说的有道理
 else our victory is empty.  He has sense.

50
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,068
我们要斩草除根
It will look better at home if we win by force.

51
00:05:42,704 --> 00:05:43,864
你可是庞贝·麦格纳斯
You are Pompey Magnus.

52
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:48,222
你所向披靡，敌人对你来说如同蝼蚁一般
You conquer and crush your enemies as if they were insects.

53
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:52,651
人们看到您现在的做法会失望的
People will be disappointed by anything less.

54
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,719
希腊来的消息
News from Greece.

55
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:59,008
马克·安东尼很安全
Mark Antony is safe, but most of the ships in his fleet

56
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:06,206
但是被派去帮助恺撒，恺撒的舰队大部分沉没
sent in aid of Gaius Julius Caesar have been lost at sea.

57
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:11,194
恺撒已经被重重包围
Caesar is now surrounded and severely outnumbered.

58
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:14,423
庞贝·麦格纳斯及其上议院
The forces of the Republic and Senate

59
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:15,992
自信的认为
and of Pompey Magnus confidently expect

60
00:06:16,062 --> 00:06:19,591
胜利已经不可逆转
a decisive victory to follow shortly.

61
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:27,108
 原来你在这  我在这
 There you are.  Here I am.

62
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,078
我找泰门让他来保护我们
I ask Timon for protection,

63
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:31,307
他却派了一队老弱病残来
and he sends me a bunch of half wits and clowns!

64
00:06:31,377 --> 00:06:34,336
 真让我感到惊讶  恺撒随时可能会死
 Dear me.  Caesar will soon be dead

65
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:36,365
我们就没有靠山了
by every account, and we shall be undefended.

66
00:06:36,435 --> 00:06:38,824
我们可能会落魄街头
We may as well be lying naked in the street!

67
00:06:38,894 --> 00:06:41,853
你必须去找赛维莉娅让她派点人手过来
You must go to Servilia and ask for a few of her men

68
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:44,392
 保护我们  为什么？
 to stand outside for us.  Why?

69
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:47,651
这样就可以以她的名义保护我们，小傻瓜
So that they can guard our doors in her name, silly.

70
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:49,480
我是说为什么要我去？
I mean why must I go?

71
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,109
你难道认为我会去找赛维莉娅求情吗？
Well, as if I would go begging to Servilia.

72
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,079
 别说笑了  我可不想去为了你求情
 I think not.  I'll not go begging for you.

73
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:56,508
别孩子气了，她又不会拒绝你
Oh, don't be so childish. It's not as if she'll refuse.

74
00:06:56,578 --> 00:06:58,667
 只是你的想法罢了  她有什么理由拒绝你呢？
 You think?  Why would she?

75
00:06:58,737 --> 00:07:01,266
我送她那么多可爱的礼物
Those lovely gifts I gave her?

76
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:06,424
 她是不是说了些什么？  没什么
 What did she say?  Nothing.

77
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,483
 没说什么… 她一定说了些什么
 Nothing.  She said something.

78
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:11,023
她什么都没说
She said nothing.

79
00:07:11,092 --> 00:07:13,951
你很无知，知道吗？
You're very arrogant, that's all.

80
00:07:14,021 --> 00:07:17,480
以为可以通过一些奴隶和乌龟就能买到她的友谊
Think you can buy her friendship with stud slaves and tortoises?

81
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,380
还有六桶冰块
And sixbarrelsofice.

82
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,239
我不想去
I'd rather not go.

83
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:22,478
你不想去？
You'd rather not go.

84
00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:25,337
难道你宁愿被那些下等人侵犯？
You'd rather be gang-raped by slavering proles

85
00:07:25,337 --> 00:07:27,196
 眼睁睁看着你母亲的房子被焚毁？
while your mother's house burns down around you.

86
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,236
老实说，我不在乎
Frankly, I'm past caring.

87
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,495
当恺撒在的时候你就趾高气昂
One day Caesar is winning and you crow happily,

88
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:33,594
当他失败的时候我却必须去开始低声下气的求人
next day he is losing, and I must go a-begging?

89
00:07:33,664 --> 00:07:36,893
我只希望这场愚蠢的战争早点结束
I just want this vile war to be over,

90
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:39,752
 越快越好  奥克塔维娅，战争已经结束了
 one way or the other.  Octavia, it is over.

91
00:07:39,822 --> 00:07:42,051
这就是为什么你必须去找赛维莉娅的原因
That is why you must go to Servilia's house.

92
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:45,180
我知道这让人难堪，但我们没有其他办法了
It's a bore, I know, but there we are.

93
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:03,694
莱蒂
Lyde.

94
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,411
真漂亮
very nice.

95
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:12,041
别过来…
Don't.

96
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:17,939
见到你真高兴
I'm glad to see you.

97
00:08:18,508 --> 00:08:20,468
我一直在担心你
I've been worried about you.

98
00:08:21,537 --> 00:08:22,497
让你费心了
No need.

99
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:24,326
我过的很好
I'm doing very well.

100
00:08:24,996 --> 00:08:27,555
不过显然，你过的更好
Not as well as you, obviously.

101
00:08:30,124 --> 00:08:32,054
你需要钱吗？
Do you need money?

102
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:35,252
如果你需要，我还有点钱
I've got money if you need some.

103
00:08:35,312 --> 00:08:37,112
你当然有钱
I'm sure you have.

104
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:39,881
背叛你的丈夫，嫁给了有钱人
Turns out your man backed the right horse.

105
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,099
有钱人都喜欢你
Fortune loves you.

106
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:50,097
我甚至都不知道乌瑞纳斯是不是还活着
I don't know if Vorenus is alive or dead.

107
00:08:55,655 --> 00:08:56,525
对不起…
I'm sorry.

108
00:09:00,184 --> 00:09:02,083
对不起
I'm sorry.

109
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:05,012
我并不想这样的
I didn't want to be like this.

110
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:10,110
我已经厌倦了，内奥比
I'm so tired, Niobe.

111
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:14,338
我厌倦了憎恨
I'm tired of being angry.

112
00:09:14,398 --> 00:09:17,127
我无法让自己继续
I'm tired of...

113
00:09:17,197 --> 00:09:19,197
恨着你
hating you.

114
00:09:23,955 --> 00:09:26,184
我只剩下你一个人可以依靠了
You're all I've got.

115
00:09:33,512 --> 00:09:34,811
对不起
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:41,769
要来点糖水吗？
Do you want some honey water?

117
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,027
你在浪费时间
You're wasting your time!

118
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:18,456
在我们饿死之前，我们早就渴死了
We'll die of thirst long before we die of hunger.

119
00:10:25,713 --> 00:10:27,672
我们可以喝他们的血
We could drink their blood.

120
00:10:27,742 --> 00:10:30,501
 你说什么？  那些死人
 Repeat?  All these dead men,

121
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:32,970
我们可以喝他们的血
we can drink their blood.

122
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,370
盐分太多
Too salty.

123
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,729
只会让你更想喝水
Only make you more thirsty.

124
00:10:38,728 --> 00:10:41,087
而且尸体都已经腐烂了
Putrid by now anyway.

125
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,316
没关系
Doesn't matter.

126
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:48,985
一切都会好起来的
Everything will be fine.

127
00:10:50,514 --> 00:10:52,713
这就是我们的死地了
This is where we die.

128
00:10:54,643 --> 00:10:56,802
你在写什么？
What are you writing?

129
00:10:56,872 --> 00:10:59,231
给内奥比的留言
A message to Niobe.

130
00:10:59,301 --> 00:11:01,270
好吧
All right.

131
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,800
是个好主意
Good idea.

132
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:06,728
也给帮我给艾瑞纳留个言吧，如果可以的话
Send my best to Eirene, will you, while you're at it?

133
00:11:07,758 --> 00:11:10,057
如果还有地方可写…
If there's space.

134
00:11:21,203 --> 00:11:23,972
格瑞丝，我们看起来漂亮极了，不是吗？
Graces, don't we look lovely.

135
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:26,871
如果我是一个乞求者，我可不会打扮成这样
If I am to be a beggar, I will not look like one.

136
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:28,730
噢，我可不是在指责什么，亲爱的
Oh, I am not objecting, my honey,

137
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,159
尽管你会让赛维莉娅知道她已经人老珠黄了
though you will remind Servilia of what an old trout she has become.

138
00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:35,028
我很高兴你可以打扮的这么漂亮
I'm just happy to see you looking so pretty for once.

139
00:11:35,088 --> 00:11:37,417
你过去总是很邋遢
You do so often insist on playing the frump.

140
00:11:53,472 --> 00:11:56,361
 祝你的母亲过的好  她过的很好
 I hope your mother thrives.  She does.

141
00:11:56,431 --> 00:11:59,030
 您儿子呢？  他也很好
 And your son?  Also.

142
00:12:07,817 --> 00:12:11,615
我的母亲让我来请求您的帮助
 My mother sends me to ask a favor.  Mm-hmm?

143
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,474
她害怕希腊的战争结果
She fears the consequences

144
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:16,273
会带来灾难
of this last battle in Greece.

145
00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:20,102
可以理解
Understandably.

146
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,801
她过惯了无忧无虑的日子
She has enjoyed her ascendancy a little too well.

147
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,859
她想从您这借点人手
She asks you to lend her some men

148
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:31,358
以您的名义保护我们的家产
to protect our door in your name.

149
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:35,387
当然可以
Of course.

150
00:12:36,476 --> 00:12:39,975
艾伦尼，派阿贾克斯去
Eleni, send Ajax and three or four others,

151
00:12:40,045 --> 00:12:43,044
 再带几个他信的过的人手  谢谢
 whoever he thinks best.  Thank you.

152
00:12:43,104 --> 00:12:45,603
很感激您的慷慨
It's very kind of you. I told my mother

153
00:12:45,673 --> 00:12:48,462
 我告诉过我母亲她不应该… 别这么说
 she should not presume-  Please.

154
00:12:48,532 --> 00:12:51,091
这都是她应得的
She shall have what she needs.

155
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:05,376
对不起，您对我们实在非常照顾
Forgive me. You are so good to us.

156
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:08,345
 我们不值得您这样做  别这么说
 We do not deserve it.  Don't.

157
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,402
我…我一定看起来糟透了
I mu- I must look a fright.

158
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,530
不，一点也不
No, not really.

159
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,559
你看起来很可爱
You look lovely.

160
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,346
我还是回家吧
I better go home.

161
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:34,775
这么快？
So soon?

162
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:37,105
我母亲会担心的
My mother will be worried.

163
00:13:39,434 --> 00:13:41,703
好吧，如果你认为如此的话…
Well, if you feel you should.

164
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,750
奥克塔维娅…
Octavia...

165
00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:26,107
谢谢
Thank you.

166
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:45,520
给罗马送个信
Send to Rome.

167
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,350
告诉他们…
Tell them...

168
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:50,308
决定性的战役…
the decisive battle

169
00:14:50,378 --> 00:14:52,838
今天开打…
begins today.

170
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,823
长官！庞贝的军团已经准备好了
Sir! Pompey's legions are in the field in battle array!

171
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:09,222
谢谢，福利维奥，不过你忘了敬礼，不是吗？
Thank you, Fulvio. Have you forgotten how to salute?

172
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:11,221
没有，长官，请原谅，长官
I haven't, sir. No excuse, sir.

173
00:15:11,281 --> 00:15:13,650
格雷科斯，马上过来
Gracchus, sound assembly!

174
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,979
 把我的马准备好  是，长官！
 Have Xeno saddle my horse.  Sir!

175
00:15:18,938 --> 00:15:22,037
我们接受开战？
We will accept battle?

176
00:15:22,107 --> 00:15:23,866
当然，为什么不？
Certainly. Why not?

177
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:26,995
我们人数上没有任何优势
We are outnumbered

178
00:15:27,065 --> 00:15:30,794
步兵数是他们的三分之一，骑兵只有他们的五分之一
three to one on foot and five to one on horse.

179
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:32,963
没受伤的士兵们
What uninjured men we have

180
00:15:33,023 --> 00:15:35,322
也快被饥饿和绝望打倒…
are scared and hungry and desperate.

181
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,222
这也是为什么我们具有破釜沉舟的准备
That is the advantage we must press home.

182
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:41,350
嘴巴不能用来打仗
I was not aware irony had military usage.

183
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,479
获胜或者死，只有一条路可走
We must win or die.

184
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:54,476
庞贝的士兵可没有视死如归
Pompey's men have other options.

185
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,520
再见，伯斯卡
Goodbye, Posca.

186
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:10,927
恺撒！恺撒！恺撒！
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

187
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,760
给罗马送个信
Send to Rome.

188
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,829
告诉他们恺撒赢了
Tell them Caesar has won.

189
00:19:09,536 --> 00:19:12,765
长官！恺撒的士兵们追来了
Sir! Caesar's men are coming!

190
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:14,864
我把我的手割破了
I've cut my hand.

191
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:18,403
我们必须快走，长官，他们会俘虏您的
We have to go, sir! They'll catch you.

192
00:19:18,473 --> 00:19:22,301
不是很深的伤口，却很痛
It's not deep, but it hurts.

193
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:25,670
他们会杀了您的！！
They will kill you!

194
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,669
都无所谓了…
It's of no consequence.

195
00:19:35,177 --> 00:19:38,675
我们的部队都失败了，现在怎么办？
Our forces are routed. What are we to do?

196
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:41,704
择日再战，这还用说吗？
We shall fight again another day I do not doubt...

197
00:19:41,774 --> 00:19:43,774
 然后击败他们  然后…击败他们
 And prevail! -...and prevail.

198
00:19:45,043 --> 00:19:47,112
但现在，我们必须先保证自己的安全
But for the present we must look to our safety.

199
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:48,842
我们的安危毫不足惜
Our safety is nothing.

200
00:19:48,912 --> 00:19:51,911
我们必须离开希腊，重新招募新兵
We must leave Greece and look to fresh levies.

201
00:19:51,971 --> 00:19:54,540
 我倒想问问我们能去哪？  非洲
 And may one ask where?  Africa.

202
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,509
我们必须在非洲重整旗鼓
We must rally the cities of Africa.

203
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:58,578
非洲，我的上帝啊
Africa. Dear gods,

204
00:19:58,638 --> 00:20:00,308
这样下去很快我们就会无处可去
we are fast running out of continents.

205
00:20:00,378 --> 00:20:01,807
还会失去金钱！
And coin!

206
00:20:01,877 --> 00:20:04,606
我们已经榨干了希腊人民的最后一点血汗
We have taxed every last coin from Greece

207
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:06,076
现在都已经花完了
and spent it all.

208
00:20:06,146 --> 00:20:08,245
我们凭什么让非洲人归顺于我们？
What shall we use to buy Africa's loyalty?

209
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:10,444
 用贝壳吗？  我们什么都不需要买
 Seashells?  We need buy nothing!

210
00:20:10,514 --> 00:20:12,044
我们可是罗马的上议院
We are the Senate of Rome!

211
00:20:12,114 --> 00:20:14,243
我们只是一群鞋上沾满泥土的老头
We are old men with mud on our shoes!

212
00:20:14,373 --> 00:20:16,442
只要我们还有一口气，我们就没有失败
We are not beaten until we are dead.

213
00:20:17,112 --> 00:20:19,841
共和国与我们同在
The Republic lives as long as we do!

214
00:20:19,911 --> 00:20:21,510
你自己去打仗吧
You may fight on as you wish.

215
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,439
我…
Asforme,

216
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:27,078
我要去向恺撒投降
I will go from here and surrender myself to Caesar.

217
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:29,777
难道你没有尊严和荣誉感吗？
Have you no dignity? No honor?

218
00:20:29,847 --> 00:20:31,577
也许有那么一点
Some little I hope.

219
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,046
但没有你那么多
Not so much as you of course.

220
00:20:34,116 --> 00:20:38,174
 恺撒会杀了你的  也许会的
 Caesar will kill you.  That may be.

221
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:40,813
但我不怕死
I'm not afraid to die.

222
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:43,912
我已经厌倦了
I'm tired.

223
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:48,181
我只想回家
I want to go home.

224
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,598
对，我的想法也是如此
Yes. My feelings exact.

225
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:57,717
布鲁图斯，以你的名字向上帝起誓…
Brutus, without the force of your name, the cause of the Re--

226
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:01,976
不！别和我谈什么共和国
Do not! Do not talk to me of the Republic.

227
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:05,874
如果我知道我是身处在
If I had known what wretched company

228
00:21:05,944 --> 00:21:07,814
一个如此腐朽，堕落，迂腐的国家
and rotten food I would endure,

229
00:21:07,874 --> 00:21:11,712
如果我知道庞贝是这样的一个蠢老头
if I had known what an old fool is Pompey,

230
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:14,411
我绝不会离开罗马
I would never have left Rome.

231
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:22,608
请原谅我的失礼
Forgive my anger.

232
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:27,317
 我刚才有些过火了  别放在心上
 I am not myself.  Think nothing of it.

233
00:21:27,377 --> 00:21:30,246
我原谅你的不敬
I merit your disappointment.

234
00:21:33,015 --> 00:21:35,084
我提议我们去菲波里
I propose we make for Amphipoli.

235
00:21:35,614 --> 00:21:37,413
我在那有钱和人力
I have men and money there,

236
00:21:37,483 --> 00:21:39,142
我们可以从那坐船去埃及
and we can go by sea to Egypt.

237
00:21:39,212 --> 00:21:42,351
托勒密的孩子都是我的生死之交
Ptolemy's children are loyal friends of mine.

238
00:21:42,711 --> 00:21:44,980
也许…
Perhaps...

239
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,149
也许…
Perhaps it's better

240
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:51,418
我们最好分道扬镳
we do not travel together.

241
00:21:56,886 --> 00:21:58,246
也许你是对的
Perhaps you're right.

242
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:00,315
毫无疑问
Better.

243
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:04,223
这样好一些…
No doubt.

244
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:38,221
我不明白
I don't understand it.

245
00:22:38,251 --> 00:22:40,820
至少该发生点什么
Something should have turned up by now.

246
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,820
我不应该就这么死了
I'm not meant to die this way.

247
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,218
 我想你理解错了  不应该是这样的
 You were misinformed.  Doesn't seem right.

248
00:22:49,227 --> 00:22:50,287
至少…
Still...

249
00:22:51,257 --> 00:22:54,855
去天堂里还能再见到我母亲
it'd be good to see my mother again.

250
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:56,855
你认为他们会有安排吗？
Do you think they have a system

251
00:22:56,925 --> 00:22:58,854
 为那些寻找亲人的家伙准备的？  什么？
 for finding people?  What?

252
00:22:58,924 --> 00:23:01,693
你死了以后，怎么去找到你想要找的人呢？
In the afterlife- how do you go about finding people?

253
00:23:01,763 --> 00:23:05,292
 一定有很多死人… 一定的…
 There must be millions of them.  Must be.

254
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:14,558
也许她已经认不出我了
She won't recognize me, probably.

255
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:17,457
她死的时候我还很小…
I was very young when she died.

256
00:23:30,663 --> 00:23:33,691
也许我会让她吓一跳，不是吗？
Probably give her a big scare though, huh?

257
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:37,430
一个高大，丑陋，残忍的家伙朝她走过去拥抱她…
Big, ugly brute coming along and giving her a hug.

258
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,699
 看那  什么？
 Look at that.  What?

259
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:42,598
那具尸体
That corpse.

260
00:23:43,728 --> 00:23:46,797
看到他在水中飘着了吗？
See how high it rides in the water?

261
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:49,736
海水把他泡的膨胀了起来
The plutonic aether inflates him.

262
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:51,795
那又如何？
What of it?

263
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:55,434
你不是喝海水喝了糊涂了吧？
You've not been drinking seawater, have you?!

264
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:54,081
 亲爱的，吃点吧  噢，对
 Husband, eat.  Oh, yeah.

265
00:25:55,611 --> 00:25:57,510
在那，亲爱的
Over here, my dear.

266
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,110
来，吃吧
Here.

267
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:03,548
 有点咸  不会啊，味道很好不是吗？
 Little salty.  Not at all. It's good, neh?

268
00:26:04,148 --> 00:26:06,087
非常好吃，妈妈
Delicious, Mama.

269
00:26:06,157 --> 00:26:09,066
亲爱的，你吃的脸上都是
Bona Dea, look at your faces.

270
00:26:10,206 --> 00:26:13,145
噢，小傻瓜
Oh, sillies.

271
00:26:58,418 --> 00:27:00,398
海伦？
Helen?

272
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:01,997
海伦
Helen!

273
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:04,676
亲爱的，醒醒，我们的人都走了
Husband, wake up! Our people are leaving.

274
00:27:14,713 --> 00:27:16,652
来吧，宝贝们，别害怕
Now now, my darlings. Don't be scared.

275
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:18,661
我们来玩个游戏吧
We're on an adventure, eh?

276
00:27:18,731 --> 00:27:21,340
第一个看到海并且喊出来的人
The first one to see the sea and cry out

277
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,749
当我们到了菲波里时，就给他一个桃子
will have a peach when we get to Amphipoli.

278
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:34,855
你，再说一次你的名字
You, your name again?

279
00:27:37,095 --> 00:27:39,874
 里桑德罗斯  里桑德罗斯，距离菲波里还有多远？
 Lysandros.  Lysandros, how far to Amphipoli?

280
00:27:39,944 --> 00:27:41,883
噢，非常近，非常近
Oh, very close. Close.

281
00:27:41,943 --> 00:27:44,822
我们按照原计划继续前进
We will continue there as planned.

282
00:27:44,892 --> 00:27:49,000
你不能随便向行人透露我的身份
You're not to announce my identity to those that we meet.

283
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,640
如果他们问起来呢？
And if they ask?

284
00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:54,688
梅拉
Mella.

285
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:57,367
 埃尼亚斯·梅拉  明白，长官
 Aeneas Mella.  Hear and obey, Captain.

286
00:27:57,437 --> 00:27:59,277
那谁付钱给我们呢？
And who'll pay?

287
00:27:59,307 --> 00:28:01,186
付钱？
Pay?

288
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,225
你们不是早就拿到报酬了吗？
You've been paid already.

289
00:28:03,285 --> 00:28:05,664
那是带路的费用，现在又要增加保护费用
For guiding, not for protection.

290
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,674
我有很多人和物资
I have many men and supplies

291
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:09,813
还有大笔的钱在菲波里
and ample coin in Amphipoli.

292
00:28:09,883 --> 00:28:12,862
 到了那你就可以拿到报酬  你身边没有钱吗？银币什么的？
 You will be paid there.  None with you now? Coin?

293
00:28:12,922 --> 00:28:16,001
没有！！我不会再容忍你的任何不敬举动
None! I'll tolerate no more of your impudence!

294
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:18,610
请原谅，长官，只是问问
No disrespect, Captain. Only asking.

295
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,419
我们出发
We go.

296
00:28:59,255 --> 00:29:02,634
你的喋喋不休都快把我逼疯了
You drive me insane with your wretched muttering.

297
00:29:02,704 --> 00:29:05,713
你整天都在和你的神唠叨些什么？
What is wrong that you must harass the gods so?

298
00:29:06,723 --> 00:29:08,222
没什么
Nothing.

299
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:10,231
那就停止吧
Well, stop it then.

300
00:29:10,301 --> 00:29:13,380
赛维莉娅邀请你明天和她一起编织
Servilia sends to invite you to weave with her tomorrow.

301
00:29:15,949 --> 00:29:18,498
 我不想去  你必须去，我已经答应了
 I cannot.  Of course you can.

302
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:20,837
 我不想去  我知道她很乏味
 I've already accepted.  I cannot!

303
00:29:20,907 --> 00:29:23,447
噢，不，我是说编织
I know she's tedious. I mean really, weaving,

304
00:29:23,517 --> 00:29:26,425
但目前来说，我们必须让她满意
but we must keep her happy for the time being.

305
00:29:28,025 --> 00:29:29,404
但是…
But--

306
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:45,529
海！海！
The sea! The sea!

307
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:48,268
异口同声！你们每个人都会得到一个桃子作为奖赏
Unison. You shall both have a peach.

308
00:30:01,553 --> 00:30:03,552
看，妈妈，死人
Look, Mama. Dead people.

309
00:30:25,204 --> 00:30:27,374
味道还不错吧？
It's good, huh?

310
00:30:27,444 --> 00:30:29,953
你们从哪来？
Where do you come from?

311
00:30:30,023 --> 00:30:31,462
布林迪西
Brindisi.

312
00:30:32,322 --> 00:30:33,322
罗马人
Romans?

313
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,860
我认识你
I know you.

314
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,469
我在哪见过你？
Where do I know you from?

315
00:30:42,638 --> 00:30:44,608
我想我们并不认识
I have not seen you before.

316
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:46,617
我肯定在哪见过你
I'm sure I've seen you somewhere.

317
00:30:46,687 --> 00:30:48,856
把水和面包留给他们，我们继续赶路
Leave them water and bread, we need to be going.

318
00:30:48,926 --> 00:30:51,465
把他们丢下？他们很虚弱
Leave them? Weak as they are?

319
00:30:51,535 --> 00:30:53,874
我已经没有时间了
I have no time to waste.

320
00:30:55,214 --> 00:30:57,993
马上就要天黑了
Soon be dark anyhow.

321
00:30:58,063 --> 00:31:00,602
我们在这扎营，明天早上就能到菲波里
We camp here, get to Amphipoli in the morning.

322
00:31:00,672 --> 00:31:02,611
我们必须坚持赶路
I insist we go on.

323
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:04,111
放松点吧，老人家
Relax, old man.

324
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:06,120
我们会到的
We get there.

325
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:12,877
你们好好休息吧，伙计们
You rest easy now, boys.

326
00:31:12,947 --> 00:31:14,337
吃点东西，恢复体力
Eat, drink, get your strength back.

327
00:31:15,656 --> 00:31:17,796
我们会成为好朋友的
You and me will be good friends.

328
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,664
嘿！你难道要我追着你的屁股后面
Hey! You want my cock up you

329
00:31:22,904 --> 00:31:25,843
才会好好干活，生一堆火起来吗？
or are you going to build a damn fire?

330
00:31:26,483 --> 00:31:28,052
我就说我们会没事的吧
I told you we'd be all right.

331
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:31,221
不用担心的
There's no pleasing some.

332
00:31:43,037 --> 00:31:44,176
我们在这扎营？
We stop here?

333
00:31:45,216 --> 00:31:46,246
为什么这么早？
Why so early?

334
00:31:46,775 --> 00:31:49,624
我想最好是这样…马上就要天黑了
Best to, I think. It'll be dark soon.

335
00:31:52,053 --> 00:31:53,892
 他们是谁？  我怎么知道？！
 Who are they?  How should I know?

336
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,105
他们是谁不管我的事？
Who cares who they are?

337
00:31:56,432 --> 00:31:58,121
对不起，对不起…
Sorry. Sorry.

338
00:31:59,171 --> 00:32:01,370
我…
I--

339
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:04,449
一切都会好起来的
all will be well,

340
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,578
我向你保证
I assure you.

341
00:32:06,588 --> 00:32:08,268
一切都会好起来的
Allwill bewell.

342
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:14,415
庞贝·麦格纳斯
Pompey Magnus.

343
00:32:15,455 --> 00:32:18,274
那个人长的很像庞贝·麦格纳斯
That man looks exactly like Pompey Magnus.

344
00:32:18,314 --> 00:32:19,474
我就说我在什么地方看到过他
That's why I thought I'd met him.

345
00:32:20,513 --> 00:32:21,713
别用手指！
Don't point.

346
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:27,811
 这不可能  简直不敢相信，不是吗？
 Never.  It's hard to believe, eh?

347
00:32:27,851 --> 00:32:30,010
他的妻子和孩子也在这里
His wife and sprouts too.

348
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:33,280
恺撒会赏给我们多少黄金啊？
Caesar's going to drown us in gold.

349
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,115
Cac!

350
00:32:47,574 --> 00:32:48,593
我们该怎么办？
What do we do?

351
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:51,082
我不知道…
I don't know yet.

352
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:55,511
感谢你能来
Thank you for coming.

353
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,300
是母亲坚持要这么做
Mother insisted.

354
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:02,908
我听说您想和我一起做编织
I understand you want me to do some weaving with you.

355
00:33:06,267 --> 00:33:07,656
抱歉让你感到不安
I'm sorry you are upset.

356
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,336
上次的事情…
The last time we saw each other--

357
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:11,755
没有关系…
It's of no consequence.

358
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:17,893
你喜欢编织吗？
Are you fond of weaving?

359
00:33:21,262 --> 00:33:22,331
我也是
So did l.

360
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,269
你的兄长怎么样？
And how is your brother?

361
00:33:30,318 --> 00:33:32,008
 他还是住在米狄欧兰侬？  是的
 Is he still in Mediolanum?  He is.

362
00:33:33,397 --> 00:33:35,626
我听说那很不错
Lovely town, so I'm told.

363
00:33:37,076 --> 00:33:38,805
 空气非常好  多米那？
 Healthy air.  Domina?

364
00:33:38,845 --> 00:33:40,025
什么事情，艾伦尼？
What is it, Eleni?

365
00:33:43,404 --> 00:33:46,802
希腊来了消息了
Word from Greece.

366
00:33:46,842 --> 00:33:48,712
恺撒赢了
Caesar has won.

367
00:33:49,731 --> 00:33:52,450
庞贝的军队被彻底击跨了
And Pompey's armies are completely destroyed.

368
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:01,997
我的儿子呢？
And my son?

369
00:34:04,766 --> 00:34:05,646
没有消息…
No word.

370
00:34:36,545 --> 00:34:37,684
别哭！
Don't cry.

371
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,392
Oh.

372
00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:09,841
以罗马的名义，停下！
Halt! In the name of Rome!

373
00:36:10,881 --> 00:36:14,830
现在称他们自己为罗马了？真不知羞耻
Calls himself Rome, now, does he? Shameless.

374
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,239
你们是谁？目的是什么？
Who are you and what's your purpose?

375
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:19,408
我们是罗马人，孩子
We are Rome, boy,

376
00:36:19,448 --> 00:36:20,598
战败的那些…
what's left of it.

377
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,996
来向你的长官投降
Come to surrender to your chief.

378
00:36:39,081 --> 00:36:39,801
布鲁图斯
Brutus!

379
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,970
西赛罗
Cicero!

380
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,439
见到你们真高兴
How happy I am to see you.

381
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:47,818
我还以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

382
00:36:48,977 --> 00:36:50,107
陛下，我…
Sir, l--

383
00:36:50,147 --> 00:36:51,806
我虔诚的到来
I am come here honorably,

384
00:36:51,846 --> 00:36:53,386
恳求您的宽恕
with no request for mercy,

385
00:36:54,425 --> 00:36:57,085
收留我的士兵和马匹
to surrender my arms and my horses

386
00:36:58,124 --> 00:37:01,963
 同时… 嘘！我们别说投降了
 as is-  Ssh. We'll have no talk of surrender.

387
00:37:02,992 --> 00:37:05,431
我们只是吵了一架，现在我们又是朋友了，不是吗？
We've merely quarreled a little. Now we are friends again, eh?

388
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,647
感激您的宽容…
That is most generous of you

389
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:10,900
以及您的男子气概
and natural to your manly nature,

390
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,863
 but I cannot-  My poor boy.

391
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:15,837
对不起，我很抱歉
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

392
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,868
Not at all.

393
00:37:19,057 --> 00:37:20,266
是我的错
It is I am sorry.

394
00:37:20,416 --> 00:37:22,335
是我让你陷入了两难的处境
I presented you with an impossible dilemma.

395
00:37:23,365 --> 00:37:25,304
你只是做了你应该做的事情
You did only what you thought honorable,

396
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:27,614
我相信你
I'm sure.

397
00:37:28,653 --> 00:37:29,823
用我的吻来化解这一切
I kiss you for it.

398
00:37:33,402 --> 00:37:35,400
谢谢
Thank you.

399
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,387
我永远不会忘记的
I will not forget this grace.

400
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,269
以我最诚挚的敬意…
 As I was saying, a most generous-  But what of Pompey?

401
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:42,128
庞贝呢？告诉我他还活着
Tell me he lives.

402
00:37:44,767 --> 00:37:45,687
他还活着…
He lives.

403
00:37:45,727 --> 00:37:46,997
感谢上帝，他在哪？
Thank the gods. Where is he?

404
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,424
He...

405
00:37:52,335 --> 00:37:56,083
他…他并不打算投降…
He does not plan to surrender.

406
00:37:56,783 --> 00:37:57,963
这太疯狂了…
That is insane.

407
00:38:00,002 --> 00:38:01,711
他无处藏身，他能逃到哪去？
He cannot escape. Where can he go?

408
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:04,500
西比乌和他在一起吗？卡托呢？
Is Scipio with him? Cato?

409
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:09,409
他们逃到非洲去了
They have fled to Africa.

410
00:38:10,568 --> 00:38:11,698
我都在想些什么呀…
What am I thinking of...

411
00:38:13,317 --> 00:38:17,046
在你们饥肠辘辘的时候问你们这些
asking you questions when you must be so hungry and thirsty?

412
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:18,835
来吧
Come.

413
00:38:21,824 --> 00:38:25,583
 我想我最好… 别说其他的
 I think I would rather-  I insist.

414
00:38:26,822 --> 00:38:27,982
来吧
Come.

415
00:38:32,031 --> 00:38:34,460
我这只手正忙着呢
So with this hand, otherwise engaged

416
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,279
我只好用我的拳头打那个小兔崽子
I had to take that worm and beat him

417
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:39,808
一拳，一拳，不停的打
with my fists over and over and over again!

418
00:39:28,261 --> 00:39:32,269
他的父亲托勒密·奥利提斯12世国王
His father King Ptolemy Auletes the 1 2th

419
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:33,599
是我的好朋友
was a close friend of mine.

420
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:37,327
他总是热情的邀请我去那
I was always assured a loving welcome

421
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:39,736
在埃及，我记得有一次
in Egypt. I remember on one occasion

422
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,295
我和国王一起出去打猎
I was out hunting with the King.

423
00:39:42,335 --> 00:39:44,545
我们在追捕狮子，你们知道吗？
We were hunting lions, you see.

424
00:39:48,113 --> 00:39:50,692
但这个国王的箭法非常糟糕
Only the King was rather a poor bowman,

425
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:55,441
我们都不知道这头狮子是不是死了…
and we couldn't tell if the lion was wounded or dead.

426
00:40:12,765 --> 00:40:14,504
嘿，伙计们
Hello, friends.

427
00:40:14,934 --> 00:40:16,903
感觉好些了吗？有力气了吗？
Feeling better, neh? Strong?

428
00:40:17,243 --> 00:40:18,123
力量十足
Strong enough.

429
00:40:21,861 --> 00:40:23,971
告诉我点消息吧，那个罗马人叫什么名字？
Tell me something. What's the name of that Roman?

430
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,640
他叫…
His name is, uh,

431
00:40:28,179 --> 00:40:29,269
埃尼亚斯·梅拉
Aeneas Mella.

432
00:40:30,008 --> 00:40:31,028
埃尼亚斯·梅拉
Aeneas Mella.

433
00:40:31,448 --> 00:40:32,148
他是这么说的
That's what he said.

434
00:40:33,587 --> 00:40:36,586
你听说过恺撒和庞贝吗？
What do you hear of Caesar and Pompey?

435
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:39,425
我知道，他们在打仗
They fought, I heard.

436
00:40:40,865 --> 00:40:41,794
然后呢？
And?

437
00:40:43,334 --> 00:40:44,893
你们当然知道谁赢了
You know who won.

438
00:40:45,513 --> 00:40:46,682
告诉我们吧
Tell us.

439
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,114
Pfft!

440
00:40:51,641 --> 00:40:53,770
我已经打算让你们入伙
I was going to let you in anyway.

441
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,979
 他在说什么？  得了，我知道你们是聪明的小伙子
 What's he talking about?  You boys are clever fellows, I bet.

442
00:40:57,019 --> 00:40:58,148
你们知道如何战斗，对吧？
Know how to fight.

443
00:40:59,188 --> 00:41:01,887
我和我的伙计们搞不定他们
Me and my boys can't take his people alone.

444
00:41:03,177 --> 00:41:06,006
我可以让你们入伙，没问题的
Us and you together, no problem.

445
00:41:07,425 --> 00:41:08,985
我们平分奖金
We go down middle on the reward.

446
00:41:09,025 --> 00:41:10,154
不错的主意
Not a bad idea.

447
00:41:10,194 --> 00:41:12,323
你们可以拥有他的妻子和孩子
You can have the wife and children,

448
00:41:12,363 --> 00:41:13,513
我把他的奴隶带走
I take the slaves.

449
00:41:17,332 --> 00:41:18,461
走开
Walk away...

450
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:22,120
 别再和我说这些  好吧
 and do not speak of this again.  I see.

451
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,299
你以为你们可以甩掉我？
Think you don't need me, eh?

452
00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:25,938
想独吞奖金吗？
Think you can keep the reward for yourself?

453
00:41:26,278 --> 00:41:29,057
 见鬼去吧，门都没有  闭嘴
 Fuck you. Not going to happen.  Don't.

454
00:41:30,097 --> 00:41:33,546
去死吧！我给了你们重生
Fuck you! I gave you your lives back,

455
00:41:33,586 --> 00:41:36,715
我也可以随时让你们去死
I can take them away again, easy.

456
00:41:37,904 --> 00:41:39,074
当我说完了以后
When I am finished speaking,

457
00:41:40,093 --> 00:41:42,623
你就转身走
you will turn and run

458
00:41:42,662 --> 00:41:43,792
 那边  那边？
 that way.  That way?

459
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:45,651
不如这儿怎么样？
What about this way?

460
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:48,221
别让我再看到你
Do not stop until you are out of my sight

461
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,320
也别回头，否则我宰了你
and do not delay, or I will kill you.

462
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,159
他是怎么回事？
What is wrong with him?

463
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:55,308
我已经说完了
I am finished speaking.

464
00:42:10,633 --> 00:42:13,521
他说话有点难听，不是吗？
A bit harsh, isn't it?

465
00:42:13,561 --> 00:42:14,781
我认为他提供的交易值得考虑
Fair enough deal he was offering, I thought.

466
00:42:16,221 --> 00:42:17,500
 你们这是干什么？  先生…
 What is the meaning of this?  Sir--

467
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:20,659
回答！这个人是我雇佣的
Speak up! This man was in my employ!

468
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:22,888
 他策划攻击你  你又怎么知道？
 He planned to assault you.  How do you know?

469
00:42:22,928 --> 00:42:24,058
他打算拉我们入伙
He asked us to participate.

470
00:42:25,097 --> 00:42:26,917
然后你就拒绝了，为了我而杀了他
You refused, stabbed him to death on my behalf.

471
00:42:26,947 --> 00:42:29,196
真是个够朋友的陌生人啊！！
A good friend to me on such short acquaintance.

472
00:42:29,236 --> 00:42:32,835
 你叫什么名字？  卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯
 What is your name?  I am Lucius vorenus.

473
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:36,183
盖乌斯·优利乌斯·恺撒麾下的13军伊瓦卡提团的长官
Prefect and Evocati of the 13th Legion of Galius Julius Caesar.

474
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:38,293
泰特斯·波罗，隶属于同一军团
Titus Pullo, legionary of same.

475
00:42:39,332 --> 00:42:40,482
对不起，卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯
Salve, Lucius vorenus.

476
00:42:41,521 --> 00:42:42,011
我是…
I am...

477
00:42:43,051 --> 00:42:44,181
埃尼亚斯·梅拉
AeneusMella...

478
00:42:44,221 --> 00:42:46,390
帕加马人
of Pergamum.

479
00:42:50,938 --> 00:42:52,707
埃尼亚斯·梅拉
AeneusMella.

480
00:42:54,877 --> 00:42:58,325
你最好明白你现在处于我的管辖之下
You must consider yourself under my charge.

481
00:42:58,365 --> 00:42:59,455
我不明白…
I do not understand.

482
00:42:59,495 --> 00:43:03,034
你是第13军团的囚犯
Consider yourself a prisoner of the 13th Legion.

483
00:43:04,843 --> 00:43:05,873
我只是个商人
I'm just a merchant.

484
00:43:06,013 --> 00:43:08,182
我们知道你是谁，先生
We know who you are, sir.

485
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:12,840
你们现在都归我管，明白吗？
I own you now! Understand?!

486
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,389
你，你，把他埋了
You, you, bury him.

487
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:17,619
你们剩下的人
The rest of you...

488
00:43:18,658 --> 00:43:20,068
 别让他们跑了  卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯
 don't let them leave.  Lucius vorenus.

489
00:43:21,107 --> 00:43:22,877
我想私下和你谈谈
I must speak with you alone.

490
00:43:24,956 --> 00:43:26,186
呆在这
Stay here.

491
00:43:29,194 --> 00:43:31,324
我的确没有表明我自己的身份
Of course I do not say I am

492
00:43:31,364 --> 00:43:32,183
你以为我是谁？
who you think I am,

493
00:43:33,023 --> 00:43:35,032
但我在军队中呆过一段时间
but I have spent some years in the army.

494
00:43:35,372 --> 00:43:38,581
也许我们在哪场战役上遇见过
Perhaps we met on some campaign or other.

495
00:43:38,621 --> 00:43:40,101
这也许是我看起来很脸熟的原因
Perhaps that's why I seem familiar.

496
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,430
也许…
Perhaps.

497
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:48,278
我想起来了，第13军
I recall the 13th...

498
00:43:49,217 --> 00:43:51,486
 那是在埃利西亚  是的
 was at Alesia.  We were.

499
00:43:51,526 --> 00:43:53,886
我总希望能亲眼目睹那场战斗
There's a battle I've always wished to have seen.

500
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:58,254
战线拉长到了25公里，是吗？
25 miles of works, wasn't it?

501
00:43:58,294 --> 00:44:00,713
 接近30  30？
 Nearer 30.  30?

502
00:44:00,753 --> 00:44:02,982
 你们有多少人？  60,000
 How many men did you have?  60,000.

503
00:44:04,022 --> 00:44:04,702
对付…哇噢
Against- whoa--

504
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:06,411
几乎是两倍的敌人
almost double the Gauls.

505
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:09,770
至少是两倍
Atleastdouble.

506
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,059
都是高卢人的勇士
The best men of every tribe in Gaul.

507
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:15,118
恺撒很会打仗
Caesar can fight.

508
00:44:15,158 --> 00:44:16,787
都是我教给他的
I'll give him that.

509
00:44:18,127 --> 00:44:19,237
我还记得…
I remember...

510
00:44:19,287 --> 00:44:21,436
他在你这个年纪的时候
when he was not much older than you.

511
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,915
我派他去驻守冬季的岗位
I sent him to winter Quarters in--

512
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:26,264
在…
in, uh...

513
00:44:28,303 --> 00:44:29,053
哪里呢？
Oh, where was it?

514
00:44:29,993 --> 00:44:31,282
都无所谓了
No matter.

515
00:44:32,322 --> 00:44:34,511
是很长时间之前的事情了
Long time gone.

516
00:44:42,768 --> 00:44:45,037
我很想问您，先生，如果允许的话
I must ask you, sir, if I may.

517
00:44:45,957 --> 00:44:48,336
你怎么会落得如此下场？
How did you come to this road?

518
00:44:50,006 --> 00:44:51,135
毫无疑问
Surely...

519
00:44:52,175 --> 00:44:54,594
和庞贝相比，恺撒处于完全劣势
Pompey had Caesar at greater disadvantage.

520
00:44:54,644 --> 00:44:55,774
确实如此
He did.

521
00:44:55,814 --> 00:44:56,943
确实如此
He did.

522
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,152
看起来根本不可能会输
It didn't seem possible to lose.

523
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:03,701
但那总不是一个好兆头
That's always a bad sign.

524
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,669
战斗是在平原开打
The battlefield was on a plain

525
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:13,857
在一条河的旁边，一些小山的山脚下
by a river, at the foot of some...Iow hills.

526
00:45:14,897 --> 00:45:16,026
就象这样
Like this, you see.

527
00:45:17,066 --> 00:45:18,565
军队在这里开始短兵相接
The lines met here.

528
00:45:19,605 --> 00:45:22,834
我的部队完全控制了局面
My men held their ground well,

529
00:45:22,874 --> 00:45:25,083
所以我派骑兵
so I sent my horses

530
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:27,252
到他的右侧去包抄
at his right flank.

531
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:28,762
看起来非常正确
Which is perfectly correct,

532
00:45:28,802 --> 00:45:30,711
 我想你也会同意的  我同意
 you'll agree.  I do.

533
00:45:31,751 --> 00:45:34,740
但是这群废物被吓倒了
Only the cowards were repulsed.

534
00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:38,788
是被一队预备兵吓倒的
Repulsed by a single cohort of reserves.

535
00:45:38,828 --> 00:45:41,547
掉头逃跑，200个骑兵
Turned and fled, 200 horses.

536
00:45:41,587 --> 00:45:44,406
直接冲回我的左侧
Crashed directly into my left flank.

537
00:45:46,445 --> 00:45:47,275
把我的阵型冲跨了
Rolled up my line

538
00:45:48,315 --> 00:45:49,434
看起来就象一张地毯
Iike a carpet.

539
00:45:50,464 --> 00:45:53,343
把我的部队完全包围了起来
Put the whole damned army to flight.

540
00:45:54,183 --> 00:45:55,272
所以我战败了…
And here I am.

541
00:45:56,352 --> 00:45:58,411
这就是庞贝·麦格纳斯
That's how Pompey Magnus

542
00:45:59,441 --> 00:46:00,181
如何被打败的
was defeated.

543
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,539
这就是共和国是如何被打败的…
That's how the Republic died.

544
00:46:17,164 --> 00:46:18,394
 晚安，先生  等等…
 Good night, sir.  Wait.

545
00:46:20,093 --> 00:46:21,263
我不会…
I will not...

546
00:46:24,612 --> 00:46:25,741
我不会为我自己
I will not ask favor

547
00:46:25,781 --> 00:46:27,611
请求什么宽恕
or mercy for myself.

548
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,120
但我请求你
But I beg you...

549
00:46:31,809 --> 00:46:33,978
考虑一下我的…
consider the fate...

550
00:46:34,688 --> 00:46:36,657
妻子和孩子的命运
of my wife and children.

551
00:46:40,686 --> 00:46:43,115
让我把他们带到埃及
Let me take them to Egypt

552
00:46:43,155 --> 00:46:44,535
让他们能在朋友的身边…
where they will be safe...

553
00:46:46,714 --> 00:46:47,843
安全的活下去…
among friends.

554
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:53,012
请考虑一下…
Consider them.

555
00:48:04,736 --> 00:48:05,926
继续睡吧
Go back to sleep.

556
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,319
简直是不明智而且不道义的行为
Unwise and unfriendly, I call it.

557
00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:26,488
愚蠢而薄情
Unwise and unfriendly.

558
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:27,658
为什么？
And for why?

559
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:28,827
为什么？
Why?

560
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:33,036
我们已经俘虏了他，我们已经俘虏了他了
We had him. We had him.

561
00:48:33,996 --> 00:48:36,455
马匹，别想什么马匹了
Horses. Never mind, horses.

562
00:48:36,495 --> 00:48:38,624
也别想什么黄金了
Never mind gold.

563
00:48:39,664 --> 00:48:41,173
恺撒会分给我们农田
Caesar would have given us farms

564
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:45,122
土地，果园和大批的奴隶
and fields and orchards and great flocks of slaves

565
00:48:45,162 --> 00:48:47,311
还有牲口！！如果我们…
and cattle and Dis knows what--

566
00:48:47,351 --> 00:48:50,690
庞贝·麦格纳斯不是那种可以用来换钱的人物
'Sist! Pompey Magnus is no damn slave to be sold for money.

567
00:48:53,709 --> 00:48:57,307
 我不明白为什么不？  你不明白的事情多着呢
 Don't see why not!  There's a great deal you don't see.

568
00:48:58,007 --> 00:48:59,416
他不明白的事情也多着呢
There's a great deal he doesn't see neither.

569
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:16,680
你和其他12个人从那场风暴中生还过来了？
You and only 12 other men survived that storm.

570
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:19,329
5,000个人中只有你们
Out of 5,000.

571
00:49:21,309 --> 00:49:23,448
你能活着一定是背负着巨大的使命
You're being kept alive for some great purpose, no doubt.  Ah, well.

572
00:49:26,087 --> 00:49:27,257
长官…
You know, sir...

573
00:49:31,545 --> 00:49:34,224
 他有一些有趣的信息  是吗？
 He has some interesting news.  lndeed?

574
00:49:34,264 --> 00:49:35,394
长官，在我们来这的路上
Sir, in course of our journey here,

575
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:38,892
我们遇上了格涅乌斯·庞贝·麦格纳斯和他的家人
we encountered Gnaeus Pompey Magnus with his family

576
00:49:38,932 --> 00:49:41,671
 还有他的仆人  哪里？
 and a party of servants.  Where?

577
00:49:41,711 --> 00:49:43,831
在去菲波里的路上，还有一辆骡车
On the road to Amphipoli, with a mule train.

578
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,800
骡车？很贵啊
A mule train. It's priceless.

579
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,179
他打算乘船去埃及，长官
He intends to take ship for Egypt, sir.

580
00:49:50,218 --> 00:49:52,548
家人还是随从，是吗？
Family and servants, you say.

581
00:49:52,587 --> 00:49:53,717
 没有士兵？  没有，长官
 No soldiers?  None, sir.

582
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,796
 一个人都没有留下  一个都没有
Not one man left, not one.

583
00:49:55,836 --> 00:49:57,886
噢，可怜的家伙
Oh, poor wretch.

584
00:50:00,135 --> 00:50:01,094
那么，为什么…
Why then, be that so,

585
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:03,654
 你为什么不俘虏他？  最感人的一段来了
 did you not apprehend him?  Now here's the onion.

586
00:50:06,772 --> 00:50:08,742
我认为那样做并不合适
I thought it would be wrong to do so.

587
00:50:09,781 --> 00:50:10,811
解释你的理由
Explain yourself.

588
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:15,019
他的手在颤抖，长官
His hands trembled, sir.

589
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:16,859
他的衣服很破败…
His clothes were dirty,

590
00:50:16,899 --> 00:50:18,988
他的眼里含着泪水，他已经彻底垮了
there was water in his eyes- he is broken.

591
00:50:19,028 --> 00:50:22,117
我认为没有必要俘虏他
I saw no need to apprehend him.

592
00:50:23,157 --> 00:50:24,306
我想补充一下，波罗士官
I'd like to add that Legionary Pullo

593
00:50:24,346 --> 00:50:26,435
没有参与这个决定，长官
took no part in my decision, sir.

594
00:50:27,595 --> 00:50:29,764
你认为没有必要
You saw no need.

595
00:50:31,644 --> 00:50:32,733
你没有看到庞贝也许
Do you not see that Pompey may be broken

596
00:50:33,713 --> 00:50:36,882
可以象个落魄的男人一样凄惨，但他还是个危险人物
Iike a Dacian catamite and still be dangerous?

597
00:50:36,922 --> 00:50:38,851
只要他还活着
If he is still living,

598
00:50:38,891 --> 00:50:43,500
敌人就可能在他身边聚集
he will be a standard around which our enemies will gather!

599
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,068
只要他还能骑在马背上
As long as he can be propped on a horse,

600
00:50:47,108 --> 00:50:47,968
他就很危险！
he's dangerous!

601
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:51,267
 但你却认为没有必要俘虏他？  没有必要，长官
 But you saw no need to apprehend him?  I did not, sir.

602
00:50:51,347 --> 00:50:54,165
我给你这么大的权力来做这个决定？
Who by the sons of Dis gives you the right to make such judgment?

603
00:50:54,205 --> 00:50:56,315
我知道这是我的失职，长官
Sir, I am aware that I have not done my duty,

604
00:50:56,355 --> 00:51:00,113
但我希望您能告诉我我的过错
and I respectfully ask your pardon.

605
00:51:00,733 --> 00:51:03,002
他要我的解释？
My pardon, he asks.

606
00:51:04,232 --> 00:51:07,511
我应该对你使用鞭刑再把你钉死在十字架上
I ought to have you scourged and crucified.

607
00:51:15,508 --> 00:51:19,107
以后你就会记得
In future you will remember that it is l

608
00:51:19,147 --> 00:51:21,246
只有我可以给予宽恕，没有其他人
that offers mercy. No one else.

609
00:51:22,285 --> 00:51:23,265
明白了吗？
Clear?

610
00:51:23,605 --> 00:51:24,445
明白，长官
Clear, sir.

611
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:26,654
解散
Dismissed.

612
00:51:32,142 --> 00:51:34,291
我并非有意忤逆您
I do not like to disagree with you,

613
00:51:34,331 --> 00:51:36,240
但您对他太过仁慈了
but you are being far too lenient with him.

614
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,389
他让庞贝跑了您却让他活着？
He let Pompey go and you let him live?!

615
00:51:41,429 --> 00:51:42,718
他应该被当作示众处死！
The man should be made an example of!

616
00:51:43,758 --> 00:51:45,297
其他任何人
Any other man, certainly.

617
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:47,666
但不是他们两个
But those two...

618
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:49,796
他们让我想起了一些东西
they found my stolen standard.

619
00:51:50,835 --> 00:51:51,895
他们从一场灾难中存活了下来
Now they survive a wreck

620
00:51:51,925 --> 00:51:56,293
又在海岸边遇上了庞贝
that drowned an army and find Pompey Magnus on a beach.

621
00:51:58,243 --> 00:52:01,262
伟大的神灵在保佑他们
They have powerful gods on their side,

622
00:52:02,291 --> 00:52:05,560
而且我也不会杀死任何有那样义气的朋友的人
and I will not kill any man with friends of that sort.

623
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,279
伯斯卡
Posca.

624
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:12,328
告诉福利维奥我们要出发了
Tell Fulvio to start breaking camp.

625
00:52:12,368 --> 00:52:13,517
我们去埃及
We're going to Egypt.

626
00:53:05,229 --> 00:53:06,378
尊敬的庞贝先生
General Pompey, sir.

627
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:10,197
还记得我吗？ 卢西尔斯·萨普提米亚斯
Remember me? Lucius Septimius.

628
00:53:11,227 --> 00:53:12,926
也是百夫长萨普提米亚斯
Centurion Septimius, as was.

629
00:53:12,966 --> 00:53:14,026
我们在西班牙共事过
I was with you in Spain.

630
00:53:15,065 --> 00:53:16,994
第四军，第三团
Fourth legion, third cohort.

631
00:53:17,034 --> 00:53:18,754
卢西尔斯·萨普提米亚斯，当然记得
Lucius Septimius, of course.

632
00:53:18,794 --> 00:53:20,923
你来这干什么？
What are you doing here, of all places?

633
00:53:20,963 --> 00:53:23,152
为埃及人工作，先生
 Working for the Gyppoes, sir.  Huh?

634
00:53:24,192 --> 00:53:25,721
我明白，先生，我们已经不是第四军了
I know, sir. It's not the fourth by no means.

635
00:53:25,761 --> 00:53:28,240
 但我们必须养活糊口，不是吗？  当然
 A man's got to earn his salt, eh?  True enough.

636
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,860
那这些士兵是来干什么的？
What's all this then, soldier?

637
00:53:31,899 --> 00:53:33,069
看起来不象是一个友善的表示
Not much of a welcome party.

638
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:37,587
你也知道，先生，这是埃及人的做法，可笑的一群人
Oh, you know Egyptians, sir, it's just their way. Funny people.

639
00:53:37,627 --> 00:53:39,776
确实如此
That they are. Well...

640
00:53:40,816 --> 00:53:41,936
老伙计
onward friend.

641
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:57,240
对不起，长官
I'm sorry, sir.

642
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:06,548

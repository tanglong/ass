克劳迪亚斯·阿皮亚斯家有偿寻找
"A fine reward is offered for the return

2
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:27,603
寻找一名被拐骗或者逃跑的女奴隶
of a slave woman stolen...or absconded from the house of Claudius Appius.

3
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,934
下列贵族将从希腊归来
The following noblemen returning from Greece

8
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,242
以及马科斯·朱尼厄斯·布鲁图斯
and Marcus Junius Brutus.

9
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,063
叛国者庞贝已经逃向埃及
The traitor Pompey has fled to Egypt.

10
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,844
伟大的恺撒紧随其后

11
00:04:24,595 --> 00:04:26,636
武器，上肩
Shoulder arms!

12
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:30,007
向前两步
Forward!

13
00:04:31,427 --> 00:04:33,608
转身
Forward face!

14
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:37,960
向前，齐步走
Forward march!

15
00:05:24,818 --> 00:05:27,449
看那，托勒密
Behold, Ptolemy,

拥有两位女神
he of the two ladies,

富饶的上下埃及

18
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,292
看那，托勒密
Behold Ptolemy,

19
00:05:37,552 --> 00:05:39,493
太阳神之子
Son of Ra,

20
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:42,854
非凡的托勒密
Ptolemy the Divine.

21
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:51,928
祝福…
Greetings--

22
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,140
不知道您的大驾将会滞留多久？
How long may we hope for the blessing of your presence?

23
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,141
不会很长
Not long.

24
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:27,851
噢，我们感到些忧郁
Oh, we are desolated.

25
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:31,973
如果显赫而又高贵的他能够透露一些到此的目的
If His Glorious Honor cares to divulge his purpose here,

26
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:35,355
雄狮的奴仆肯定万分荣耀的为您效劳，
the servants of the Mighty Lion

27
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,406
无论什么要求，何种方式
would be ecstatic to help you in any way whatsoever.

28
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,847
你真是太客气了
That is most kind of you.

29
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:47,849
你们的战争准备做得如何了？
How goes your preparation for war?

30
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:49,980
战争？
War?

31
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,761
我们没有需要准备的战争
We have no war prepared.

32
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:54,791
那我肯定是得到了错误的消息
I'm misinformed then.

33
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:56,792
我听说雄狮的姐姐
I was told the sister of the Mighty Lion

34
00:06:56,862 --> 00:06:59,793
对于他王位权力有所质疑
disputes his right to the throne.

35
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:02,184
不许说她
Do not speak of her.

36
00:07:02,294 --> 00:07:03,715
我唾弃她！
I piss on her! I shit on her!

37
00:07:03,745 --> 00:07:05,896
我践踏她！

38
00:07:05,896 --> 00:07:08,457
我们敬爱的公主
It is true our beloved princess

39
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:13,068
确实听从了一些恶意的劝告，提出了荒谬的主张
has listened to ill counsel and raised some absurd claim.

40
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:15,819
但是，完全没人支持她…
But... she has no support,

41
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:19,531
除了，那些叛国者跟野蛮人外
none but traitors and barbarians.

42
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:22,802
那个名字是什么来着？
What was that name?

43
00:07:23,072 --> 00:07:24,603
博格门的达洛加斯
Deilogos of Pergamum.

44
00:07:24,673 --> 00:07:27,234
他可以征集10个军团
He can raise 10 legions.

45
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:29,234
博格门的达洛加斯
Deilogos of Pergamum

46
00:07:29,304 --> 00:07:33,036
可以为她征召10个军团
can raise 10 legions for her.

47
00:07:33,106 --> 00:07:37,007
一个卑微的强盗而已，我向您保证，肯定没有问题
A petty bandit. I assure you, you have no problem,

48
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:40,108
完全不用担心克利奥帕特拉（埃及艳后）
no fears at all about Cleopatra.

49
00:07:40,178 --> 00:07:41,349
她在哪里？
Where is she?

50
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:43,170
嗯，没人知道
Well, nobody knows.

51
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,781
我们相信是在南部的某个地方
Somewhere in the south, we believe.

52
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,742
他在说谎，她在他们手里
He lies. They have her.

53
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:53,814
你们双方对于王权的质疑必须要结束
This dispute between you both must end.

54
00:07:53,884 --> 00:07:56,985
罗马想要的是一个稳定的埃及
Rome desires Egypt to be at peace.

55
00:07:57,055 --> 00:08:00,556
你们的谷物必须还要不断海运到罗马
Your grain ships must keep sailing.

56
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:02,607
整个国家绝对在我们的掌握之中
We are in absolute control of the country,

57
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:04,218
从海边到瀑布，到处都在控制之中
from the lighthouse to the Cataracts.

58
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:06,818
很好，这样的话把庞贝·麦格纳斯交给我了
Good, in that case you should have no trouble

59
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:09,019
对你们来说，就不会很麻烦了
in handing over Pompey Magnus.

60
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:10,960
我不喜欢他的声音
I do not like his tone.

61
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,781
他可以走了
He can go.

62
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:19,117
主人，您还记得我们之前说的？
Master, do you remember what we spoke of before?

63
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,464
鳄鱼跟狐狸的故事吗？
Of crocodile and fox?

64
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:25,095
让我们给他一点惊讶！
Let us show him our surprise!

65
00:08:25,165 --> 00:08:27,966
好吧，继续，给他看吧
All right, go on. Show him.

66
00:08:31,698 --> 00:08:32,200
荣耀的阁下
Ahem...

67
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,374
我们为您准备了一个礼物
We have a gift for you, Glorious Excellency,

68
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,001
我们想您肯定会非常喜欢的
that we think you will be very pleased with.

69
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:19,116
我们准备为他做个身体
We were going to make him a body,

70
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:22,537
活动的胳膊和腿跟真实的动物以及其他东西做个滑稽剧…
moving arms and legs, and do a mime show with real animals and everything--

71
00:09:22,537 --> 00:09:23,958
安静！
Silence!

72
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:38,203
我深深地为托勒密家族这种野蛮的行为而感到羞耻，羞耻！
Shame on the house of Ptolemies for such barbarity. Shame.

73
00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:41,274
但是…你们是敌人啊
But... you are enemies.

74
00:09:41,494 --> 00:09:44,185
他是罗马的执政官
He was a consul of Rome!

75
00:09:52,198 --> 00:09:53,699
罗马的执政官！
Aconsul ofRome.

76
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:57,800
以这种肮脏的方式死去
To die in this sordid way--

77
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,702
跟一些低贱的小偷一样被肢解
quartered like some low thief--

78
00:10:01,772 --> 00:10:03,342
耻辱！
shame!

79
00:10:07,044 --> 00:10:08,674
他剩下的部分都在哪里？
Where is the rest of him?

80
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:11,846
呃，嗯，已经被火葬了…
Eh, um, he has been cremated...

81
00:10:11,906 --> 00:10:16,727
当然…是在符合所有礼节的情况下进行的
with all proper funeral rites of course. With all decorum.

82
00:10:17,378 --> 00:10:20,409
我明天会回来
I shall return tomorrow,

83
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:26,061
到时候，你把杀了庞贝的人交给我
at which time you will give me the man that took Pompey's life.

84
00:11:27,614 --> 00:11:30,485
船长说风向很好
Captain says the wind is fair.

85
00:11:30,885 --> 00:11:34,277
 好的  我们可以在你希望的时候离开
 Good.  We can leave whenever you like.

86
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:37,578
你带着一半的人手马上赶回罗马
You will take half the men, return to Rome immediately.

87
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:43,370
宣布庞贝死讯的荣耀就留给你了
You shall have the honor of announcing Pompey's death.

88
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,701
我会回去的…
I shall follow you...

89
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:49,542
只要我把这里的事情解决完了
when I've settled things here.

90
00:11:54,554 --> 00:11:57,555
解决事情？解决什么事情？
Settled things? Settled what things?

91
00:11:57,585 --> 00:11:59,196
埃及内战迫在眉睫
Civil war is in the air.

92
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:02,837
必须要阻止
It must be prevented.

93
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:05,308
为什么？
Why?

94
00:12:05,368 --> 00:12:09,380
让这些不幸的人打个天昏地暗吧
Let the wretches fight it out.

95
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,081
战争会破坏来自埃及的谷物
War will disrupt the grain supply.

96
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:16,292
如果没有了埃及的粮食整个罗马都会挨饿
Without Egyptian grain, Rome goes hungry.

97
00:12:16,342 --> 00:12:20,084
不插手的话，将会是…不明智的
It would be... unwise not to intervene.

98
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:23,975
只有半个军团，你如何插手？
And how will you intervene with only half a legion?

99
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,916
我没有打算通过战斗的方式进行
I do not intend to fight.

100
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:30,988
我只会为双方派别做出裁断
I shall merely arbitrate the various factions.

101
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:33,519
你说得可真轻松
You make it sound so easy.

102
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:38,301
仅仅是对于罗马的仇恨就会让这些派别联合起来
Those various factions are united only by their hatred of Rome.

103
00:12:40,772 --> 00:12:42,232
他说的没错
He's right.

104
00:12:42,272 --> 00:12:46,614
托勒密可能会用你来唤起公众对于一个共同敌人的仇恨
Ptolemy might use you to rouse the people against a common enemy.

105
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:49,585
我征服了高卢
I have conquered Gaul.

106
00:12:49,655 --> 00:12:51,826
我击败了庞贝·麦格纳斯
I have defeated Pompey Magnus.

107
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,897
我想我能够对付一个小男孩跟太监的
I think I can handle a small boy and a eunuch.

108
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:57,838
一个有十万手下的小男孩
A small boy with 100,000 men.

109
00:12:57,898 --> 00:12:59,769
我知道这一点！
I am aware of that!

110
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,909
但是他还只是个小男孩
He's still a boy nonetheless.

111
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,651
你似乎忘记了我们自己的战事还没有结束
You seem to forget that our war is not over yet.

112
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:09,592
卡托跟西比乌仍然在逃
Cato and Scipio are still at large.

113
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:12,694
稍作喘息，他们会征召出另一只军队
Given time, they will raise another army.

114
00:13:12,764 --> 00:13:14,694
那么如果他们这么做的话我会击垮他们的
And when they do I shall crush them.

115
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:17,205
我很高兴你如此自信
I'm glad you're so confident.

116
00:13:17,595 --> 00:13:19,906
有些人会称之为自大
Some would call it hubris.

117
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:23,047
只有我失败了，才能说是自大
It's only hubris if I fail.

118
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:34,372
记住，她是一个有着悠久历史的王族的公主
Remember, she is a princess of ancient blood.

119
00:13:34,442 --> 00:13:37,983
当你们找到她的时候对待她要有最深的敬意
When you find her you will treat her with the utmost respect.

120
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:41,524
任何合理的要求都必须被满足
You must obey her in all things, within reason.

121
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:43,035
明白，长官
Understood, sir.

122
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:45,226
都看你的了，乌瑞纳斯
I'm counting on you, vorenus.

123
00:13:49,337 --> 00:13:51,168
你有什么要说的吗？
You have something to say?

124
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:54,139
我希望为庞贝·麦格纳斯的事情道歉
Regarding Pompey Magnus, sir, I wish to apologize.

125
00:13:54,739 --> 00:13:59,101
正是由于我的行为而使他走到了这个结局
It was my actions that brought him here to this end.

126
00:13:59,341 --> 00:14:02,762
 如果我能够尽我的责任  当然
 If I had done my duty-  lndeed.

127
00:14:05,213 --> 00:14:06,484
解散
Dismissed.

128
00:14:32,484 --> 00:14:34,554
杀死庞贝的凶手
Pompey's murderer.

129
00:14:35,325 --> 00:14:37,355
啊，他已经逃走了
Alas, he has run away.

130
00:14:37,425 --> 00:14:39,866
找到他
Find him.

131
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:43,398
除此之外…
In the meantime...

132
00:14:43,418 --> 00:14:47,220
这个文书列出了陛下
these instruments tabulate the money that was borrowed

133
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:51,053
光耀伟大的父亲托勒密12世所借的钱
by His Majesty's illustrious father, Ptolemy Xll.

134
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:54,692
我以共和国的名义来收取欠款
In the name of the Republic, I have come to collect.

135
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:57,593
1,700万银币
17 thousand thousand drachma.

136
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,746
1,700万？
17?

137
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:07,747
太荒谬了！
Absurd!

138
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:09,357
大概应该是400万吧
Four, perhaps.

139
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:13,989
欠单里包括了所有从庞贝那里借的钱
The tabulation includes all monies borrowed from Pompey

140
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:17,771
还包括了其他无法来收取欠款的共和国人的钱
and other agents of the Republic now unable to collect.

141
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:20,201
这是不公正的！
That is not just!

142
00:15:20,602 --> 00:15:22,282
所有故去者这类生前的利益
Post-mortem interests of this type

143
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:25,714
都已经合法的转移给了目前的执政官
are legally entailed to the presiding consul,

144
00:15:25,744 --> 00:15:27,014
也就是盖乌斯·优利乌斯·恺撒
i.e. Gaius Julius Caesar.

145
00:15:27,084 --> 00:15:29,925
 法律就是这样  罗马的法律
 It's law.  Roman law.

146
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:33,196
难道还有其他的什么法律…
Is there some other form of law...

147
00:15:33,256 --> 00:15:35,367
你这个卑贱的女人？
you wretched woman?

148
00:15:37,468 --> 00:15:41,810
万分的歉意，请原谅我们
1,000 apologies. Forgive us.

149
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:48,952
这个！
There!

150
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:52,664
 这个就是给你们的欠款  非常抱歉…
 There's for your payment.  So sorry...

151
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:56,805
陛下似乎忘记了，他只是罗马的附庸
His Majesty forgets he is a vassal to Rome.

152
00:15:57,275 --> 00:15:59,106
附庸？
vassal?

153
00:15:59,176 --> 00:16:00,677
附庸？我可不是什么附庸！
vassal? I am no vassal!

154
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:04,598
 我是国王，我是…  坐回去！
 I am king! I am-  Sit down!

155
00:16:12,301 --> 00:16:14,002
谢谢
Thank you.

156
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:16,703
我什么时候可以收到欠款？
When can I expect payment?

157
00:16:17,173 --> 00:16:21,885
大人，我们仅仅只有够自用的一些银币
Your Honor, we have little enough ready coin for our own needs.

158
00:16:21,945 --> 00:16:26,056
付税的农夫们没有像以前那样耕作都是因为…
Our tax farmers have not been working as they should because...

159
00:16:26,126 --> 00:16:28,327
因为？
Because?

160
00:16:29,628 --> 00:16:33,539
由于克利奥帕特拉的愚蠢行为部分地区出现了动荡
Cleopatra's foolishness has stirred unrest in some parts.

161
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,660
都不是大问题
Nothing serious.

162
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:42,582
好吧，我不想让人认为我是不讲道理的
Well, I do not wish to appear unreasonable.

163
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:46,824
偿还1千万银币我也可以接受
I will accept 10 thousand thousand drachma.

164
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:49,895
即使是这个数目，也要很长时间才能凑齐
Even that amount will take many days to collect.

165
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:53,437
如果是这样的话我将会有足够的时间
In that case, I shall have ample time to adjudicate

166
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:56,678
来裁定你们跟克利奥帕特拉公主之间的争议了
your dispute with Princess Cleopatra.

167
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:58,679
这个想法非常好
Excellent notion.

168
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:01,420
但是，唉，谁知道克利奥帕特拉公主在哪里呢
But alas, who knows where Princess Cleopatra is?

169
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,420
噢，这你不用担心
Oh, do not worry about that.

170
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:05,551
我会找到她的
I shall find her.

171
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,996
血与火！
Blood and fire!

172
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:21,427
这里就跟锻冶之神的阴茎一样热
It's as hot as vulcan's dick!

173
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,750
真是垃圾
What a dump.

174
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,421
埃及的众神肯定都是废物才造出像这里这样的地方
Gyppo gods must be right wasters to make a place like this.

175
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,943
别在人家的国度说他们神的坏话
Don't speak ill of the gods in their own country.

176
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,744
是啊，没错，我见过他们的神
Gerrae. I've seen their gods.

177
00:17:39,804 --> 00:17:43,535
我泰特斯·波罗可不会害怕任何长着狗头的东西
Titus Pullo isn't scared of any bastard with a dog's head on him.

178
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:48,127
你真是更傻了那些神都很古老而且强大
More fool you. These gods are old and powerful.

179
00:17:48,197 --> 00:17:51,338
早在罗马之前埃及曾经是个伟大的国家
Egypt was a great nation long before Rome.

180
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:53,179
是吗？
Was it?

181
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:56,230
现在还在自欺欺人，对吧
Mumped it up now, then, haven't they?

182
00:18:01,082 --> 00:18:03,343
我们为什么待在这里
Why are we here, anyhow?

183
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,374
 等待
Waiting.

184
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,214
对 我知道我们在等待 但是，等的是谁呢
Yeah, I know we're waiting, but for who?

185
00:18:07,975 --> 00:18:09,805
看见他们，我就会知道的
I'll know when I see them.

186
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:13,967
嗨，原来是这样
Heh. Be like that.

187
00:18:15,998 --> 00:18:17,928
“附庸”,他这么说！
"vassal," he says!

188
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:20,159
无礼的贱人！
Barbarian scum!

189
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,350
那完全是勒索
It's simple extortion.

190
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,912
如果我们不还钱，他就会扶植克利奥帕特拉登上王位
If we do not pay him, he will put Cleopatra on the throne.

191
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:28,412
如果…
If...

192
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,373
如果他可以找到她
if he could find her.

193
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,404
他是个消息灵通人士
He is a resourceful man.

194
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:35,905
他会找到她
He will find her.

195
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:39,066
我们抓到她的时候就应该把她处死的
She should have died when we first caught her.

196
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:43,848
现在必须要这么做了，她一定要死
Now it must be done. She must die.

197
00:18:43,878 --> 00:18:45,679
我同意
I agree.

198
00:18:46,989 --> 00:18:49,840
我手下在天黑时分就可以到达她那里
My men could be with her by nightfall.

199
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:46,124
告诉他等着
Tell him "Wait."

200
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:52,256
克利奥帕特拉
Cleopatra.

201
00:20:52,326 --> 00:20:53,587
王后陛下？
Queen Majesty?

202
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:56,908
胡图求见
Hutto asks to speak with you.

203
00:21:07,402 --> 00:21:09,393
打我一个耳光
Slap me.

204
00:21:16,055 --> 00:21:18,556
 白天还是晚上？ 晚上
 Night or day?  Night.

205
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,978
他可以进来了
He may enter.

206
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,271
陛下…
Majesty...

207
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:32,602
亚历山大城有了新的指示
fresh word has come from Alexandria.

208
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:36,333
说话，贱人！
Speak, worm!

209
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,824
我不得不万分遗憾的说
I am most deeply sorry to say

210
00:21:39,894 --> 00:21:44,416
陛下必须要为踏上黄泉路做好准备了
Majesty must prepare herself for her journey to the afterlife.

211
00:21:46,687 --> 00:21:48,618
什么时候？
When?

212
00:21:48,678 --> 00:21:50,948
现在
Now.

213
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:22,060
说出你的遗言吧
Say your words.

214
00:23:34,387 --> 00:23:36,598
女士们，你们好
Hello, ladies.

215
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:40,310
攻击恺撒？
Attack Caesar?

216
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,061
你是认真的吗？
Are you serious?

217
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,732
为什么不是呢？
Why not?

218
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,733
他现在只有几百人跟着
He only has a few hundred men with him.

219
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:52,194
你可以召集多少人？
How many men could you rally?

220
00:23:56,456 --> 00:23:59,417
你将会成为埃及的解放者
You would be the liberator of Egypt.

221
00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:01,548
你的名字将永远流传
Your name would live forever.

222
00:24:01,618 --> 00:24:03,548
我的生命可能就不会那么幸运了
My mortal flesh should be less fortunate.

223
00:24:03,638 --> 00:24:05,689
罗马从来不忘记受到的伤害
Rome does not forget an injury.

224
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,970
噢，忘记罗马吧
Oh, forget Rome!

225
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,301
罗马已经玩完了
Rome is doomed.

226
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:14,202
她的子民们像疯狗一样互相残杀
Her people tear at their flesh like mad dogs.

227
00:24:14,342 --> 00:24:17,944
10年时间，那个城市就会成为被遗忘的废墟
In 10 years the city will be a forgotten ruin.

228
00:24:17,994 --> 00:24:20,675
有可能会这样，但是明年怎么办？
Maybe so, but what of next year?

229
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,056
也许你是对的
Perhaps you're right.

230
00:24:23,746 --> 00:24:26,947
因此，谨慎是最好的选择
Ergo, caution is best, yes.

231
00:24:27,948 --> 00:24:34,670
或许…在人民心目中你没有那么大的影响力
Perhaps... you don't have enough influence among the people.

232
00:24:36,571 --> 00:24:38,802
恺撒只带了那么少的手下
And Caesar has so few men.

233
00:24:39,852 --> 00:24:43,243
只要一句话，我就能够征集全城的人
I could raise the whole city with a word.

234
00:24:45,054 --> 00:24:47,375
想想吧
Think on it.

235
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:56,758
哦，不知我可不可以借用一下萨普提米亚斯？
Oh, do you think I could borrow Septimius for a little while?

236
00:24:56,778 --> 00:24:58,619
我会非常感激的
I'd be most grateful.

237
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,501
没问题
Of course.

238
00:25:12,494 --> 00:25:15,455
长官，托勒密13世的信使求见
Messenger from Ptolemy Xlll begs entry, sir.

239
00:25:36,663 --> 00:25:39,795
带来了水的托勒密拥有两位女神
"Ptolemy the Water Bringer, he of the two ladies,

240
00:25:39,795 --> 00:25:42,215
拥有上下埃及，王中之王，太阳神之子
he of sedge and bee, King of Kings, Son of Ra,

241
00:25:42,215 --> 00:25:45,087
通告荣耀的大人以及随从
informs His Most Grand Honor, et cetera,

242
00:25:45,157 --> 00:25:48,918
带来这个消息的人，就是杀死庞贝的人
that him who bears this message is him that killed Pompey."

243
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:27,833
他够英俊
He's handsome enough.

244
00:26:27,903 --> 00:26:31,234
优美坚实的下巴
Good, strong chin.

245
00:26:31,294 --> 00:26:33,765
对我来说，就像个又老又贱的男人
Looks like a mean old man to me.

246
00:26:36,626 --> 00:26:38,257
继续说
More.

247
00:26:38,317 --> 00:26:40,587
神的肉体已经发霉了
Divinity's mortal flesh turns green.

248
00:26:40,647 --> 00:26:43,178
拿过来
Give it here.

249
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,290
当她到达亚历山大城的时候她会看起来就像个爬虫
She will look like a reptile when she arrives at Alexandria.

250
00:27:24,794 --> 00:27:26,995
我称之为，软弱
Weak, I call it.

251
00:27:35,198 --> 00:27:37,529
软弱，我是吗？
Weak, am l?

252
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:39,680
她知道如何好好教训她的奴隶
She knows how to beat her slaves well enough,

253
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,601
但是她就是离不开那个烟斗
but she cannot throw away that pipe,

254
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:46,432
 而且她自己也明白这一点  无礼的小矮子
 and she knows it.  lnsolent dwarf.

255
00:27:46,802 --> 00:27:48,933
你什么都不知道
You know nothing.

256
00:27:51,734 --> 00:27:53,375
非常好的建议
Throw it out.

257
00:27:56,336 --> 00:27:59,137
扔…它出去
Throw... it out.

258
00:28:41,423 --> 00:28:43,614
软弱，我是吗？
Weak, am l?

259
00:28:49,826 --> 00:28:53,547
那个埃及公主 啊，现在是那个婊子
That Gyppo princess, now that's good cunny.

260
00:28:53,918 --> 00:28:55,698
她父亲的手下跟亚历山大一起战斗过
Her father's people rode with Alexander.

261
00:28:55,698 --> 00:28:57,699
 你不能这么说她  虽然她是
 You can't speak of her like that.  She is, though,

262
00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:01,881
她非常非常想要我
and she wants me badly.

263
00:29:02,501 --> 00:29:07,002
你应该在我废了那个努比亚人的时候来看看，她浪的出水
Should've seen her when I done that Nubian. Wet as October!

264
00:29:08,633 --> 00:29:10,344
波罗，看着我
Pullo, look at me.

265
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,254
她是有王室血统的公主
She is a princess of royal blood.

266
00:29:12,274 --> 00:29:13,705
你碰她，你就死
You touch her, you die.

267
00:29:13,775 --> 00:29:15,706
我不是蠢人
I'm not stupid.

268
00:29:15,776 --> 00:29:17,536
我只是说她想要我
I'm just saying she wants me.

269
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:57,011
真可爱，真可爱
Lovely. Lovely.

270
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,693
没有什么比又冷又臭的汗更加能够吸引男人的啦
Nothing like cold, stinking sweat to seduce a man.

271
00:30:03,124 --> 00:30:05,144
恺撒会以为他跟阿芙罗狄蒂在天堂呢
Caesar will think himself on Olympus with Aphrodite.

272
00:30:05,394 --> 00:30:07,895
安静，贱人！
Hush, piglet!

273
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:12,397
你懂什么叫诱惑？
What do you know of seduction?

274
00:30:12,857 --> 00:30:15,518
只要恺撒是个男人
As long as Caesar is a man,

275
00:30:16,088 --> 00:30:18,019
我就会吃定他
I will have him.

276
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:21,410
她似乎很有信心
She seems very sure of herself.

277
00:30:21,961 --> 00:30:25,052
我或者征服他…或者死去
I have him... or I die.

278
00:30:26,772 --> 00:30:29,033
所以我会征服他
So I will have him.

279
00:30:29,103 --> 00:30:31,734
那么可能就会这样，伊希斯
May it be so, lsis.

280
00:30:49,311 --> 00:30:53,443
我只是希望他今天在这里
I only wish he were here today.

281
00:30:53,483 --> 00:30:57,344
我正好在两次落红之中
My womb is between the flood.

282
00:30:58,985 --> 00:31:02,796
肯定会孕育出一个孩子
A child would come as sure as spring.

283
00:31:30,296 --> 00:31:31,997
来
Come.

284
00:31:34,338 --> 00:31:35,838
你，来
You, come.

285
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,300
Ahh-ooh...

286
00:31:51,975 --> 00:31:53,915
这么红！
So red!

287
00:31:54,275 --> 00:31:56,366
殿下，请问我能够为您效什么劳
Your Highness, how can I be of service?

288
00:32:01,768 --> 00:32:04,759
皮革味，橄榄味，没那么坏
Leather. Olives. Not so bad.

289
00:32:09,981 --> 00:32:11,592
他，可以吧
 He will do.  Majesty commands you will enter her.

290
00:32:11,592 --> 00:32:13,503
陛下命令你“进入”她的身体

291
00:32:14,883 --> 00:32:18,314
 我不是很明白  你跟她交配
I do not understand. You have coitus with her.

292
00:32:19,135 --> 00:32:22,196
你搞错了吧，交配是“造人”的意思
You have it wrong. Coitus means to make babies.

293
00:32:22,266 --> 00:32:24,887
没错！那么，造人吧
Exact! So, make babies.

294
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,180
别害怕
Don't be scared.

295
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,791
我不是害怕，我只是不能做你们要求的事情
I'm not scared, I just cannot do what you ask!

296
00:32:35,881 --> 00:32:38,812
这不是…这不是我们的传统
It is not- it is not in our custom.

297
00:32:38,872 --> 00:32:42,834
罗马男人是不会被女人这样使用的
Roman men are not used by women in this way.

298
00:32:43,344 --> 00:32:45,685
来吧，你会很享受的
Come, you will enjoy it.

299
00:32:45,765 --> 00:32:48,326
我们的王后是个完美的女人
My queen is an excellent lover.

300
00:33:19,217 --> 00:33:22,349
他在等什么
What is he waiting for?

301
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:26,920
他必须按照吩咐去做
He must do as he is told!

302
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,991
 让我帮帮你  让开
 Let me give you a hand.  Get off!

303
00:33:29,751 --> 00:33:33,923
我不得不请求陛下的谅解，但是我无法顺从您的意愿
I must ask forgiveness of Your Majesty, but I cannot comply!

304
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:36,484
我不是能被命令去这么做的奴隶
I am no slave to be commanded so!

305
00:33:36,554 --> 00:33:40,225
 并无冒犯之意  他拒绝了？
 With all respect-  He refuses?

306
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:44,907
这个…小虫子，拒绝我？！
This... insect refuses me?!

307
00:33:45,377 --> 00:33:49,039
你怎么敢拒绝太阳神之女的要求呢？
You dare refuse the daughter of a sun god?

308
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,691
波罗，马上向克利奥帕特拉公主报道，并且按照她吩咐的去做
Pullo, report immediately to Princess Cleopatra and do as she says!

309
00:33:55,691 --> 00:33:57,762
 嗯？ 你听到了我的命令！
 Eh?  You heard!

310
00:33:57,762 --> 00:34:00,923
 怎么了？ 快去
 What's going on?  Just go.

311
00:34:13,868 --> 00:34:17,869
军团的泰特斯·波罗前来报道，请指示，女士
Legionary Titus Pullo reporting for duty, ma'am.

312
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,756
Whooh.

313
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:37,739
 天哪，那真是美妙，我跟你说  我不想知道
 Gods, that was something-  I don't want to know.

314
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,421
如果你珍惜你的生命，你就再也不要提起这件事
If you value your life, you won't speak of it again.

315
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:47,113
为什么？我只是听从命令而已，真是他妈的好命令啊
Why? I was only obeying orders. Bloody good orders, too.

316
00:35:47,673 --> 00:35:50,344
你认为恺撒听到这件事，他会怎么做？
What do you think Caesar will do if he hears of it?

317
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:52,855
我不是笨蛋
I'm not stupid.

318
00:35:52,925 --> 00:35:57,197
我答应了公主，我不再提起这件事
I promised the princess. I shall not speak of it.

319
00:35:57,347 --> 00:35:58,667
你无法守住这个秘密来保住你的生命的
You can't keep a secret to save your life.

320
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:00,478
因为你有着一个像排水沟一样的大嘴巴
You've got a mouth like a drain.

321
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,359
Whooh.

322
00:36:49,837 --> 00:36:51,687
克利奥帕特拉公主，长官
Princess Cleopatra, sir.

323
00:36:51,737 --> 00:36:53,598
两位神的女儿
Daughter of the Two Rams,

324
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,988
上下埃及的女主人
mistress of sedge and bee!

325
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:40,083
Oh!

326
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:43,197
做的好，陛下！
Well done, Majesty!

327
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:44,367
哦，谢谢
Oh! Thank you.

328
00:38:32,045 --> 00:38:36,717
有问题吗，小丈夫？
Is something wrong, little husband?

329
00:38:50,922 --> 00:38:54,593
你坐在父亲的椅子上真是太滑稽了
How funny you look in Father's chair.

330
00:38:54,864 --> 00:38:57,074
 我从来没有想过要伤害你  嘘
 I never wanted to harm you.  Shh.

331
00:38:58,365 --> 00:39:00,866
你当然没有这么想过
Of course you did not.

332
00:39:01,296 --> 00:39:05,748
是你手下的阉党带你进入迷途
It was your gelding led you astray, no doubt.

333
00:39:06,268 --> 00:39:09,339
 女主人  不许说话！
 Mistress-  It must not speak.

334
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,101
必须去死！
It must die!

335
00:39:29,146 --> 00:39:30,677
是他…
It was him...

336
00:39:33,018 --> 00:39:34,889
不是我
not me.

337
00:39:36,029 --> 00:39:39,070
他引导他走向迷途
He led him astray,

338
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,071
不是我
not me.

339
00:39:41,141 --> 00:39:44,182
是他！
It was him!

340
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,742
排好阵型
Get in formation!

341
00:40:43,344 --> 00:40:45,575
你也一样，波罗
And you, Pullo.

342
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,739
卡尔普…蕊娜
Calpurnia...

343
00:40:59,651 --> 00:41:02,352
她是你的第三任妻子？
She's your third wife?

344
00:41:02,422 --> 00:41:04,762
她是的
She is.

345
00:41:09,204 --> 00:41:11,815
她给你生了儿子吗？
Has she given you a son?

346
00:41:11,885 --> 00:41:14,086
他没有
She has not.

347
00:41:15,797 --> 00:41:18,167
多么悲哀
How sad.

348
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:22,679
男人没有儿子就没有未来
A man without sons is a man without a future.

349
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:25,220
我从来没这么想过
I never thought of it that way.

350
00:41:27,891 --> 00:41:30,602
悲哀
Sad.

351
00:41:31,162 --> 00:41:33,203
没关系了
Never mind.

352
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:37,585
你是否已经占据了上游港口？
Have you secured the upriver ports?

353
00:41:37,655 --> 00:41:40,356
你必须马上这么做
You must do so immediately.

354
00:41:40,426 --> 00:41:43,997
控制港口的人就能控制埃及
Whoever controls the ports controls Egypt.

355
00:41:46,308 --> 00:41:48,979
毫无疑问，很好的建议
Good advice, no doubt,

356
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:52,020
 如果我想要控制埃及  你当然想要
 if I wanted to control Egypt.  Of course you do.

357
00:41:53,021 --> 00:41:54,961
否则的话你为什么在这里？
Why else are you here?

358
00:41:55,031 --> 00:41:59,443
为什么如此英雄般的把我从死亡威胁中救了出来…
And why save me so heroically from death...

359
00:41:59,503 --> 00:42:03,184
如果不是为了利用我…
if not to use me as your...

360
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:05,825
作为你的傀儡女王？
puppet queen?

361
00:42:09,977 --> 00:42:12,208
你不喜欢这个想法？
Do you dislike the notion?

362
00:42:12,278 --> 00:42:14,679
我的想法是无关紧要的
My wishes are immaterial.

363
00:42:15,779 --> 00:42:19,160
你把我从囚禁中救出
You redeemed me from captivity.

364
00:42:19,711 --> 00:42:23,412
我是你的奴隶
I am your slave.

365
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:58,710
举盾牌！
Testudo!

366
00:45:39,266 --> 00:45:41,036
 你还好吗？ 非常好
 Are you well?  Well enough,

367
00:45:41,136 --> 00:45:43,307
虽然我没睡觉
though I do not sleep.

368
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:46,408
我写了些非常糟糕的诗来度过夜晚
I write very bad poetry through the night

369
00:45:46,478 --> 00:45:49,620
到了早上，我把草稿给了厨房让他们当柴火烧了
and in the morning I give it to the cook to stoke the kitchen fire.

370
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,340
那真是一种魔法
It's a form of magic.

371
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,661
我写的有罪恶感的东西
My ill conscience is transformed into

372
00:45:54,731 --> 00:45:56,672
就被转化成烤鸟，蛋糕什么的了
roast birds and pastries.

373
00:45:56,742 --> 00:45:59,443
你不应该有罪恶感
You should have no ill conscience.

374
00:45:59,513 --> 00:46:02,154
我们只是做了不得不做的事情
We only did what we had to do.

375
00:46:02,224 --> 00:46:06,026
毫无疑问，萨杜恩在吃了他的孩子之后，也是这么说的
No doubt Saturn said something of the sort after eating his children.

376
00:46:07,736 --> 00:46:10,637
问题在于…
The question is...

377
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:13,078
如果恺撒不能从埃及返回…
if Caesar does not return from Egypt--

378
00:46:13,148 --> 00:46:15,349
哦，更高深的陷阱恺撒都曾逃脱过
Oh, Caesar has escaped tighter traps than this.

379
00:46:15,419 --> 00:46:19,101
他已经陷在亚历山大大半年了
He has been besieged in Alexandria the better part of a year.

380
00:46:19,161 --> 00:46:21,231
或许他的好运都用完了
Perhaps his luck has run out.

381
00:46:21,301 --> 00:46:23,842
那么，我们会看起来很傻
Well, what fools we shall look

382
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:26,864
如果我们向一个死人屈膝的话
if we have kissed the feet of a dead man.

383
00:46:27,114 --> 00:46:31,095
恺撒死了的话，混蛋马克·安东尼
With Caesar dead, that bastard Marc Antony

384
00:46:31,165 --> 00:46:33,136
就能够为所欲为了
will be unleashed to do as he wants.

385
00:46:33,206 --> 00:46:36,907
非常有可能，但是我对此毫不关心了
very likely, but it isn't a concern of mine.

386
00:46:36,977 --> 00:46:38,778
我已经厌倦政治了
I am done with politics.

387
00:46:38,818 --> 00:46:40,889
过度自怜不是不好
Self-pity is all very well.

388
00:46:41,419 --> 00:46:45,030
我也不是不为自己感到羞耻
I'm not unashamed myself.

389
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,142
但我们仍然是元老
But we are still senators.

390
00:46:48,212 --> 00:46:50,542
我们应负起元老的责任
We have responsibilities.

391
00:46:50,613 --> 00:46:53,574
我要提醒你，我们曾经发过效忠的誓言
I remind you we swore an oath of loyalty.

392
00:46:53,734 --> 00:46:55,824
是效忠恺撒，不是安东尼
To Caesar, not to Antony.

393
00:46:58,105 --> 00:47:01,847
卡托跟西比乌在努米底亚已经征召了一支军队
Cato and Scipio have raised an army in Numidia.

394
00:47:01,907 --> 00:47:03,847
如果我们跟他们暗通声息的话
If we were to communicate with them,

395
00:47:03,918 --> 00:47:05,858
我们可能…我们可能…
we might- we might--

396
00:47:06,799 --> 00:47:08,209
这不是西赛罗吗
If it isn't Cicero.

397
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,411
真是蹊跷啊，我刚刚还想着你呢
How strange. I was just now thinking of you.

398
00:47:15,742 --> 00:47:17,683
我刚刚收到了一些喜讯
I've received some happy news,

399
00:47:17,753 --> 00:47:20,424
我的第一个念头就是到这里告诉你们
and my first thought was to come and tell you two.

400
00:47:22,344 --> 00:47:24,045
你也在这儿
And here you are.

401
00:47:26,406 --> 00:47:28,347
真是太巧了！
What a coincidence!

402
00:47:28,417 --> 00:47:31,988
经常发生这种事真是太有趣了，对吧？
It's amusing how often that happens, eh?

403
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,989
我呢，正在穿越广场
So I was walking across the Forum

404
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,970
心里想着那个女人
and thinking of this particular woman,

405
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:37,640
那个应该到我面前的女人
who should arrive right in front of me

406
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,541
但是那个女人
but the thing herself.

407
00:47:40,811 --> 00:47:43,312
野蛮的小西班牙人
Savage little Spanish creature.

408
00:47:43,382 --> 00:47:45,723
长发及臀，呵！
Hair down to her ass. Huh!

409
00:47:50,975 --> 00:47:53,006
大家都误解了我，你们知道吗
Everyone misjudges me, you know.

410
00:47:54,517 --> 00:47:56,617
我是个仁慈的人
I'm a merciful man.

411
00:47:56,687 --> 00:47:58,628
我知道我的名声并非那样
I know that's not my reputation,

412
00:47:58,798 --> 00:48:00,859
但我确实是
but I am.

413
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:05,371
现在，大家都有资格犯上几个错误
Now, everyone's entitled to a few mistakes.

414
00:48:05,371 --> 00:48:08,402
神也知道，我自己也犯了一两个错误
Gods know, I made one or two myself.

415
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,723
我做了一些…
I've done things...

416
00:48:13,564 --> 00:48:18,185
我都羞于启齿的事情
things I'm ashamed to think of.

417
00:48:21,007 --> 00:48:24,928
我们，我们不是一路都完美的
We are, all of us, imperfect in our way.

418
00:48:24,938 --> 00:48:26,689
没错
Exactly.

419
00:48:27,369 --> 00:48:31,210
我们都不是完美的
We are, all of us, imperfect.

420
00:48:36,422 --> 00:48:39,233
西赛罗兄弟，把你的手给我
Give me your hands, brother Cicero.

421
00:48:44,075 --> 00:48:47,216
发自我内心的…
With all my heart...

422
00:48:47,286 --> 00:48:48,787
我原谅你
I forgive you.

423
00:48:49,487 --> 00:48:51,748
我不明白你的意思
I don't know what you mean.

424
00:48:54,489 --> 00:48:57,450
没有事情可以瞒过我
Nothing escapes me.

425
00:48:58,321 --> 00:49:02,092
就算一只鸽子死在艾文台，我也能听到
If a pigeon dies on the Avantine, I hear of it.

426
00:49:06,534 --> 00:49:10,215
那么兄弟你要注意了，如果我再一次听到…
So be assured, brother, if I ever again...

427
00:49:10,455 --> 00:49:12,486
你的名字…
hear your name connected

428
00:49:13,656 --> 00:49:16,868
跟任何叛乱搭上了边…
with murmurs of treachery...

429
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,300
我就会把这双
I will cut off

430
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:28,832
白嫩细滑的小手砍下来
these soft, pink hands,

431
00:49:29,102 --> 00:49:33,494
并且把他们钉到元老院的门口
and nail them to the Senate door.

432
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,351
安东尼？
 Antony?  Hmm?

433
00:49:53,161 --> 00:49:55,802
你刚才说你有好消息要告诉我们的
You said you had happy news to tell us.

434
00:49:55,802 --> 00:49:58,343
噢，是的，当然了
Oh. Yes. Of course.

435
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:01,864
亚历山大城来的信使说
A courier came from Alexandria.

436
00:50:02,715 --> 00:50:04,495
恺撒已经击败了托勒密围城的队伍
Caesar has lifted the siege

437
00:50:04,505 --> 00:50:06,746
并血洗了他们
and massacred the armies of Ptolemy.

438
00:50:06,776 --> 00:50:09,217
他既安全又健康
He is safe and sound,

439
00:50:09,287 --> 00:50:11,958
而且统御了全埃及
and master of all Egypt.

440
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:19,041
这个人真是他妈的天才，对吧？
The man is a damn prodigy, eh?

441
00:50:36,577 --> 00:50:39,018
立正！
Atten-hut!

442
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:15,666
Hail Caesar!

443
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:06,548

1
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,867
我们该走了
We should go.

2
00:02:05,277 --> 00:02:07,287
快到晚上了
Night is coming.

3
00:02:07,637 --> 00:02:09,976
你知道的，他们站着睡觉
They sleep standing up, you know.

4
00:02:11,736 --> 00:02:13,436
大象们
Elephants.

5
00:02:14,806 --> 00:02:19,255
一旦倒下了，他们就无法再站起来
On account once laid down, they cannot rise again.

6
00:02:19,385 --> 00:02:21,175
是这样的吗？
Is that so?

7
00:02:22,404 --> 00:02:24,244
我还真是不知道
I was not aware.

8
00:02:35,162 --> 00:02:36,802
我们该走了
We should go.

9
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:38,802
去哪儿？
Where?

10
00:02:40,331 --> 00:02:42,101
尤地加离这儿不远
Utica is not far.

11
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:44,801
尤地加
Utica.

12
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:47,600
那儿有什么？
What's there for us?

13
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,170
掩蔽之处以及食物
Shelter. Food.

14
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,729
这两样我都不需要
I need neither.

15
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,859
那么，睡觉呢
Sleep, then.

16
00:02:56,929 --> 00:02:59,128
睡觉还是不错的
Sleep would be pleasant.

17
00:03:03,298 --> 00:03:05,297
那么…
So...

18
00:03:06,357 --> 00:03:08,657
就去尤地加
Utica then.

19
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:58,429
天呐！
Dear me.

20
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:01,728
说真的，阿奎奈这里真是我们最好的选择了么
Really, Aquinas, is this the best we can do?

21
00:04:01,748 --> 00:04:02,758
无所谓，无所谓
No matter. No matter.

22
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:07,407
弄点水，洗漱洗漱
Bring water for washing.

23
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:09,947
再整点面包…跟红酒
And bread... and wine.

24
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:17,086
我想今晚我要把自己灌醉
I think I shall make myself drunk tonight.

25
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:20,625
也许这一次你应该加入我
Perhaps just this once you will join me.

26
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:22,955
我不这么想
I think not.

27
00:04:23,355 --> 00:04:25,554
精神点，我们还活着
Cheer up. We live.

28
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:27,354
是的，我们还活着
We do. We live.

29
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:29,354
只要还有生命，就有希望
And where there's life, there's hope.

30
00:04:29,424 --> 00:04:31,723
我只是在想我们是否做成了任何事情，老朋友
I'm afraid if we have done anything, old friend,

31
00:04:31,783 --> 00:04:34,183
我们的经历已经驳斥了那个谚语了
we've disproved that proverb.

32
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:36,923
阿奎奈，这块面包太硬了
Aquinas, this bread is stubborn.

33
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:38,782
把你的小刀给我
Give me your knife.

34
00:04:42,152 --> 00:04:43,921
西比乌…
Scipio...

35
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,651
你具有隐忍的精神
you have a tolerant spirit.

36
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:50,350
如果你可以，你应该…
If you can, you should...

37
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,620
跟恺撒和平相处
make your peace with Caesar.

38
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,180
噢，我没想过那个，我应该跟着你干
Oh, I don't know about that. I shall do whatever you do.

39
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,749
我是不会那么做的
I wouldn't do that.

40
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,319
 走你自己的路  不论怎样，我们别说这个了
 Go your own way.  In any case, let's not discuss it now.

41
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:03,548
会有很多时间进行这种悲观的讨论的
There'll be plenty of time for such sad talk.

42
00:05:03,618 --> 00:05:06,418
请原谅我
If you'll excuse me.

43
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:08,947
我要去小便
I need to urinate.

44
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,047
我相信那边有个小便的地方
There's a pisspot through there, I believe.

45
00:06:06,938 --> 00:06:09,668
来人啊！来人啊！
Help! Help!

46
00:06:40,423 --> 00:06:41,322
让他们都离开
Send them away.

47
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,989
现在动手吧
Do it now.

48
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:05,248
动作利索点，孩子
Cut deep, boy.

49
00:07:07,838 --> 00:07:08,568
永别了，长官
Goodbye, sir.

50
00:08:17,717 --> 00:08:19,586
我们非常感激
We thank you so much.

51
00:08:19,646 --> 00:08:23,186
我们希望你们能够欣赏我们卑贱的努力
We hope you have enjoyed our humble efforts

52
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:26,145
在这样一个快乐的日子里！
on this happy day!

53
00:08:27,945 --> 00:08:32,784
我们显赫的长辈归来的日子！
Happy day on which our glorious father has returned!

54
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:37,833
朱力安太阳升起的日子
Happy day on which the Julian sun has risen

55
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:41,083
让庞培的夜晚永远消失吧！
and banished Pompeian night forever!

56
00:08:42,113 --> 00:08:46,412
我们勇敢的勇士回家的日子
Happy day on which our brave soldiers

57
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:49,442
能够跟他们的家人团聚！
have come home to their families!

58
00:08:49,512 --> 00:08:53,081
快乐的日子！
Happy day!

59
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,639
 你好  欢迎回来
 Salve.  Welcome back.

60
00:09:30,975 --> 00:09:34,074
 这次回来再也不用走了吗？ 是的，是的
 Are you home for good now?  I am. I am.

61
00:09:34,134 --> 00:09:36,104
我再也不用出征了
No more soldiering for me.

62
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:24,426
太好了，亲爱的
Bona Dea.

63
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:26,796
真是很好，对吧？
It's nice, isn't it?

64
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:28,895
没错
It is.

65
00:10:31,575 --> 00:10:35,864
 这些是什么人？ 我在去年买了他们
 Who are these?  I bought them last year.

66
00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:38,294
我们现在有4个奴隶了？
Four slaves we have now?

67
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:40,364
当时他们的价格很优惠
They were a good price.

68
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:42,393
相对于一个战士的薪水来说？
On a soldier's wage?

69
00:10:43,863 --> 00:10:46,863
肉店付的钱，而且还节余下来不少
The butcher shop paid for them with plenty to spare.

70
00:10:46,922 --> 00:10:48,522
肉店？
The butcher shop?

71
00:10:48,592 --> 00:10:51,122
莱蒂跟我弄了个不错的生意
Me and Lyde have made a nice business out of it.

72
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,791
有时候每周能够有500头
Five hundred head a week sometimes.

73
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:58,321
主要是猪，当然也有跟宗教交易的牛跟羊
Pigs mostly, but some sheep and cows for the religious trade.

74
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,788
艾瑞纳！
Eirene!

75
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:21,777
 看见你真是太好了  主人，我也很高兴见到你
 It's very good to see you.  It's good to see you too, master.

76
00:11:22,317 --> 00:11:24,856
 你说我们的语言！ 如果这能够让你高兴的话
 You speak our words!  If it pleases you.

77
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:26,476
噢，当然，当然让我高兴
Oh, it does. Of course it does.

78
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,325
你想喝点什么吗？
Can I get you anything?

79
00:11:31,395 --> 00:11:33,155
如果能有水的话就很好
A bit of water would be nice.

80
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,253
Ah!

81
00:11:48,453 --> 00:11:50,452
我给你带了点东西
I brought you something.

82
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,220
这里，让我来
Here, let me.

83
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,649
真可爱
Lovely.

84
00:12:13,578 --> 00:12:16,678
祭祖节在本月15号开始
"Parentalia begins on the ldes.

85
00:12:16,748 --> 00:12:18,678
神殿将会关闭
Temples will be shut,

86
00:12:18,748 --> 00:12:20,817
不会在其中举行庆典
and no wherein celebrated.

87
00:12:20,877 --> 00:12:24,617
公众的欢庆将在竞技场第5小时开始
Public festivals shall be at the fifth hour in the circus.

88
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,546
卡比托奈山丘兄弟会将提供红酒，
Wine to be provided by the Capitoline fraternity,

89
00:12:27,606 --> 00:12:31,006
磨坊行会将会提供面包
and cakes by the Guild of Millers.

90
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:34,105
磨坊行会仅使用最好的谷物
The Guild of Millers uses only the finest grains--

91
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:38,274
真正的罗马面包给真正的罗马人
True Roman bread, for true Romans."

92
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:47,203
那个又老又肥的婊子，对吧？
The fat old bitch herself eh?

93
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:49,023
回家的感觉肯定很好
Must be good to be home.

94
00:12:50,942 --> 00:12:52,772
大概，你已经离开了两年了？
What is it, two years you've been gone?

95
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:56,571
你还在跟我妈妈上床吗？
Are you still fucking my mother?

96
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:00,001
当她想要我的时候
When she'll have me.

97
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,377
怪不得你好像什么都知道
That would explain your excessive familiarity.

98
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,170
 对不起  没什么
 Excuse me.  That's all right.

99
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,229
我只是好奇 而且你是对的
I was merely curious, and you're correct.

100
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:11,399
回家的感觉真好
It does feel good to be home.

101
00:13:28,126 --> 00:13:30,686
我亲爱的儿子
My darling boy.

102
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:36,255
还是这么帅
So handsome.

103
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:39,994
 姐姐，希望你都还好  让我拥抱你
 Sister, I hope you're well.  Let me hug you.

104
00:13:43,194 --> 00:13:45,054
进去洗洗
Come inside and wash.

105
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,693
把你身上那种马的臭味洗掉
Let's get rid of the stink of horse off you.

106
00:13:47,753 --> 00:13:51,852
泰门，我会，晚点再见你的
Timon, I'll, uh... see you later.

107
00:13:57,572 --> 00:14:00,131
快点，母亲，我们会迟到的
Please, Mother, we will be late.

108
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:03,711
哦，我们不能迟到，迟到是永远都无法接受的
Oh, we must not be late. That would never do.

109
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,650
我并不想去参加晚宴，正如你一样
I do not want to go to dinner any more than you do,

110
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,950
但是恺撒对我真是太好了
but Caesar has treated me extremely well,

111
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,819
所有如果被邀请我们就要去
and we must go if asked.

112
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,819
 荣耀的请求…  荣耀？
 Honor demands--  Honor?

113
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:15,879
 荣耀  那么就不荣耀
 Honor.  Not honor then,

114
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,118
只是常识
common sense.

115
00:14:17,478 --> 00:14:20,118
我无法要求恺撒的宽恕
I cannot ask mercy of Caesar,

116
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:22,218
接受他的任命以及宠爱之后
accept rank and favor from him,

117
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,947
再拒绝他的友谊
and then refuse his friendship.

118
00:14:24,017 --> 00:14:27,547
什么样的男人才会一开始就请求宽恕？
What sort of man asks for mercy in the first place?

119
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,566
我可以告诉你，母亲
I assure you, Mother,

120
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:32,946
我不为自己感到自豪
I am not proud of myself.

121
00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:35,275
我根本一点都不自豪
I am not proud at all.

122
00:14:35,345 --> 00:14:37,375
在贵族们自取灭亡的那种场合
In lieu of a noble suicide,

123
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:39,815
你应该感到满足了
you shall have to be content with that.

124
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:45,524
把我的围巾拿来
Bring me my shawl.

125
00:14:46,074 --> 00:14:47,773
请不要去了
Please, do not come.

126
00:14:47,843 --> 00:14:50,203
我会向阿提娅解释的
I shall make your excuses to Atia.

127
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:52,643
当然不行，我要去
Certainly not. I will go.

128
00:14:52,703 --> 00:14:55,862
缺席将会被看成软弱的表现
Not to be there would be seen as weakness.

129
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,340
或许去看他对你也有好处
Perhaps it will do you good to see him.

130
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,320
他只是个人
See that he is just a man.

131
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:15,429
失去他的爱情并不值得你
The loss of his affection is not worth

132
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:17,769
无尽的愤怒以及悲伤
this endless raging sorrow.

133
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,128
我既不感到愤怒也不感到悲伤
I feel neither rage nor sorrow.

134
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:23,618
我对于恺撒的异议完全是基于政治的
My objection to Caesar is purely political,

135
00:15:24,197 --> 00:15:26,627
而不是个人感情的
not personal.

136
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:30,356
庞提克军队跑得如此快
The Pontic troops ran so fast

137
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:32,346
我都不知道他们是否曾经停下来过
I don't know if they ever stopped.

138
00:15:32,356 --> 00:15:34,866
怪不得庞培如此轻松的就把庞提克拿下了
It is no wonder Pompey took Pontius so readily.

139
00:15:34,886 --> 00:15:36,665
一个拿着棍子的小孩或许都可以做到
A child with a stick might have done so.

140
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:39,595
那么下一个目标是什么呢，长官？日尔曼，有可能吗？
What next, sir? Germany perhaps?

141
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:42,894
恐怕下个月我就必须加上一场盛典
I'm afraid I must put on a triumph this next month,

142
00:15:42,954 --> 00:15:45,194
让那些该死的畜生们来安排
and they're damnable beasts to organize.

143
00:15:45,854 --> 00:15:47,754
人们喜欢胜利的检阅
Still, the people love a good parade

144
00:15:47,794 --> 00:15:49,193
那么我们就不能让他们失望
and we must not disappoint them.

145
00:15:49,193 --> 00:15:51,213
看见你们两个真是太好了
How lovely to see you both.

146
00:15:52,133 --> 00:15:55,362
 真的是太久了  我们很高兴能来这里
 It's been far too long.  We are joyful to be here.

147
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:58,392
 很高兴，真的  这是用于葬礼的围巾吗？
 Joyful, indeed.  Is this a mourning shawl?

148
00:15:58,462 --> 00:16:01,261
很漂亮，有什么人死了吗？
It's very pretty. Has someone died?

149
00:16:01,331 --> 00:16:03,561
有很多人都死了
Agreatmanyhavedied.

150
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:06,161
没错，但是现在一切都结束了
How true. But it's all over now,

151
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,930
而且我们还活着，嗯？
and we're still alive, neh?

152
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,190
这真是不可能，屋大维？
It's not possible. Octavian?

153
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,629
天哪，你让我感觉自己很老
Gods, you make me feel old.

154
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,349
来
Come.

155
00:16:29,747 --> 00:16:31,677
大概有四个人那么高
It is the height of four men,

156
00:16:31,747 --> 00:16:33,506
还有一个长长的像鹅一样的脖子
with a long neck like a goose,

157
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,646
像豹子那样的斑点像马一般的速度
spots like a leopard, and the speed of a horse.

158
00:16:36,706 --> 00:16:39,145
我不信，又是个什么狮头，羊身，蛇尾的怪物
I don't believe it. A new Chimera.

159
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:41,005
我向你保证这绝对是真的
I assure you, it is quite real.

160
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:42,875
走运的话，你可以在我的盛典上看到一个
With any luck, you may see one at my triumph.

161
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:44,744
几个月前我就试着弄一头过来，
I have been trying to bring one over for months now,

162
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,674
但是那种可怜的动物不断的在路途上死亡
but the wretched creatures keep dying on the way here.

163
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:49,474
 他们不喜欢大海  听起来真是够累了
 They do not like the sea.  It all sounds very tiring.

164
00:16:49,544 --> 00:16:51,773
这个万恶的盛典结束后
After this infernal triumph is done

165
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:55,803
 你一定要到乡下修养  我也有这么想
 you must go to the country and relax.  I should like that,

166
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,142
但是盛典之后我就要开始认真的工作了
but then my work begins in earnest.

167
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,542
我必须提出归权于共和
I must set about putting the Republic to rights.

168
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:03,301
非常好的想法，你打算怎么进行？有想过吗
Splendid notion. How shall you proceed, do you suppose?

169
00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:06,971
我有几个想法，但是我还是乐于听取意见
I have a few ideas, but I am open to suggestion.

170
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,270
昨天，我看到马其奥那个面包师在一堆垃圾里面
Yesterday, I saw Malchio the baker in a litter.

171
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,300
一个面包师！我不得不立刻中止这种事情
A baker! I'd put a stop to that sort of thing immediately.

172
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,570
我会关注这件事情的
I shall have it looked into.

173
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,399
屋大维？
 Octavian?  Hmm?

174
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:20,099
如果你是我的话，你会如何进行？
How would you proceed, were you me?

175
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:23,308
 嗯，进行什么？  归权于共和
 Uh, proceed with?  Putting the Republic to rights.

176
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,127
如何进行
how to proceed.

177
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:31,067
我会开始一个有关公众工作的大型项目
I would start a large program of public works--

178
00:17:31,127 --> 00:17:33,526
雇佣公民跟自由人
employ citizens and free men,

179
00:17:33,926 --> 00:17:35,646
维修排水管道河坝之类的工作
repair the aqueducts, levee the river- that sort of thing.

180
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,006
我会增加最少100个以上新的元老
I would create at least 100 or so new senators,

181
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:41,225
这样我就可以确认他们是我的人而不是我隐秘的敌人
that I could be sure were my creatures rather than my secret enemies.

182
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:42,895
屋大维，你到底想说什么？
What is your point, Octavian?

183
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,225
我不是说你布鲁图斯，你是个值得尊敬的人
I did not mean you, Brutus, you're a man of honor.

184
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:47,194
我相信你的投诚是真诚的
I believe that your capitulation is sincere.

185
00:17:47,264 --> 00:17:48,494
你能这么说真好
How nice of you to say so.

186
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:50,324
我刚刚有个想法
I just had a thought.

187
00:17:50,324 --> 00:17:53,763
你是不是有个叫艾黎奥斯希克拉丝手下最近才死？
Did not your man Aelius Siculus die recently?

188
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,663
恐怕是这样的事实上死在萨泊萨斯
I'm afraid he did. In Thapsus, in fact.

189
00:17:56,723 --> 00:18:00,162
那样的话你应该取代他成为一个大祭司
Just so. You shall take his seat at the pontiff's table.

190
00:18:00,222 --> 00:18:02,192
大祭司？太年轻？
Pontiff? So young?

191
00:18:02,262 --> 00:18:03,761
 我进入长老院的时候
I was not so much older

192
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,350
我也不是很老  没错，但是…
 when I entered the college.  very true, but--

193
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:08,021
我相信我有权
I believe I have the authority

194
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:09,791
 指派我想安排的人  绝对没错
 to appoint whom I like.  lndeed, yes.

195
00:18:09,861 --> 00:18:12,190
这真是莫大的荣耀，快亲吻你舅公的手
This is a great honor. Kiss your uncle's hand.

196
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,420
我可以亲吻您的手，舅公，但是我做不好一个祭司
I kiss your hand, Uncle, but truly I would make an ill pontiff.

197
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,219
别胡说八道，你会成为一个好祭司的
Don't be ridiculous. You'll make a lovely pontiff.

198
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:18,689
你会照应的，对吧？
You'll see to it, right?

199
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:21,439
我宁可集中精神于诗歌
I had rather thought to concentrate on my poetry for a while.

200
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:24,328
 他会成为一个好祭司的  诗歌可以慢慢再说
 He'll make a lovely pontiff.  Poetry can wait.

201
00:18:24,328 --> 00:18:26,458
但是不耽搁太久
It should not wait too long.

202
00:18:26,528 --> 00:18:29,457
诗歌是属于年轻人的
Poetry is a young man's calling...

203
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:31,287
你不认为吗？
don't you think?

204
00:18:43,085 --> 00:18:46,615
我们在这里，萨泊萨斯的城墙就在身后
There's us with the walls of Thapsus at our backs

205
00:18:46,685 --> 00:18:48,684
你老爸也就在这里
and your father was just here.

206
00:18:48,914 --> 00:18:51,014
他们所有的军团，骑兵
Now coming towards us on the plain

207
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:53,983
还有900头战象
with all their legions, cavalry

208
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:57,413
直接冲向我们
and 900 war elephants,

209
00:18:57,483 --> 00:18:59,513
我的老天爷啊
Scipio and Juno.

210
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:03,382
“紧紧的稳住”恺撒说 “让这帮混蛋们冲过来！”
"Hold fast," says General Caesar, "let the bastards come!"

211
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:05,352
 让我来  请不要这样，主人
 I'll do it.  Please, don't, master.

212
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:07,481
这是我的工作，女主人会生气的
This is my work. Lady will be angry.

213
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,311
谁才是主人，嗯？
Who's master, eh?

214
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:12,280
投石机架在城墙上，而且锋线的士兵认为
...ballistas on the city walls, and the front line thinks

215
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,180
他们听到了前进的口令，于是在长官可以停止他们之前
they've heard the order to advance, so before the officers can stop it,

216
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,240
所有的部队以双倍的速度冲向了西比乌的手下
the whole fucking army charges on Scipio's men double tempo.

217
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:19,779
此时，战象们…
Now, the elephants--

218
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:22,409
看到我们边跑边狂叫
elephants see us come running and screaming

219
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:25,278
他们居然转了个头冲向自己的队伍了
and they turn tail and charge on their own lines--

220
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:27,108
砰！一片混乱！
boom! Chaos!

221
00:19:28,908 --> 00:19:31,277
噢，别哭，只是个游戏
Oh, don't cry, it was just a game.

222
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:36,966
一天无所事事坐在这里，你肯定很无聊
You must be bored, sitting around here all day.

223
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:38,936
我并没有这样感觉
I don't mind it.

224
00:19:39,006 --> 00:19:42,236
 你们已经退伍一个月了  我知道
 You've been discharged a month.  I know.

225
00:19:42,506 --> 00:19:45,875
我并没有催促的意思，钱以及其他事情都还好
I mean, there's no hurry. We're all right for money and everything--

226
00:19:45,975 --> 00:19:47,965
但是我不能永远无所事事的混着
But I can't be loafing around here forever.

227
00:19:49,364 --> 00:19:51,704
那么你不想从事肉店的买卖？
So you don't want to take up the butchering trade?

228
00:19:51,764 --> 00:19:53,104
管理店务？！
Shopkeeping?!

229
00:19:53,164 --> 00:19:56,433
起码你能够有点事情可做
It will give you something to do.

230
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,890
对于军官真是个好工作，呵？
This is fine work for a prefect, eh?

231
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,590
 味道就像回到过去的老时光  没错
 Smells like old times.  It does that.

232
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,289
你还记得在阿瓦砾卡的那次围城吗？
You remember that little siege at Avaricum?

233
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:23,289
坐在门槛上可对生意没有什么帮助
You'll not learn a trade sitting on your pugas.

234
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,358
还有好多被宰杀的牲畜需要挂起来呢
There's plenty more carcasses to be hung.

235
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:41,216
明天，你明天久能够拿回你的钱！
Tomorrow! You'll have your money tomorrow!

236
00:20:41,286 --> 00:20:44,156
 把他的鼻子割下来  不，别这样…
 Let's take his nose off.  No, not me no--

237
00:20:44,216 --> 00:20:45,815
嗨，住手！
 Don't- don't fuss.  Hey, stop that!

238
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:49,855
到别的地方去做这种事
Take your business elsewhere.

239
00:20:49,925 --> 00:20:52,054
 干你屁事，你个混蛋？ 会影响我的生意
 What's it to you, you bastard?  It's bad for trade.

240
00:20:52,114 --> 00:20:53,754
你他妈的是谁，小个子？
And who the fuck are you, little man?

241
00:20:53,814 --> 00:20:55,614
我是卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯， 我认得你
 I am Lucius vorenus,  I know you.

242
00:20:55,684 --> 00:20:59,553
大兵哥，对吧？住在染厂那边，有个漂亮的媳妇
Soldier boy, isn't it? Up by the dyeworks, tasty wife.

243
00:20:59,613 --> 00:21:01,183
少扯我的老婆
Do not speak of my wife.

244
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:03,182
快走，这是命令
Get gone. That's an order.

245
00:21:03,252 --> 00:21:05,012
不不不，命令，命令？不不不
No no no. Orders? Orders? No no no.

246
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:08,312
你现在不是士兵了，你只不过是个他妈的看店的店员
You're not a soldier now. You're a fucking shopkeeper's clerk.

247
00:21:12,381 --> 00:21:15,540
 你死定了，你死定了  现在就离开
 You're dead, you are.  Walk away now

248
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,680
以后也不要让我在这条街上看见你
and do not let me see you on this street again.

249
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,829
你们两个都死定了
Both of you... dead.

250
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,327
都别看了，忙你们自己的事吧
Get back to your business.

251
00:21:37,407 --> 00:21:39,207
你不应该这么做的
You shouldn't have done that.

252
00:21:39,237 --> 00:21:41,736
他们是伊拉斯特斯·弗尔曼的手下
Those were Erastes Fulmen's people.

253
00:21:41,806 --> 00:21:43,986
对于他的不敬，他不会就这么算了
He won't take disrespect like that.

254
00:21:44,026 --> 00:21:45,886
 你打了他  没什么大不了
 You hit him.  It was nothing.

255
00:21:47,655 --> 00:21:49,535
伊拉斯特斯·弗尔曼会杀了你的
Erastes Fulmen will kill you.

256
00:21:50,515 --> 00:21:52,714
 他只是个骗子  他过去是的
 He's just a crook.  He used to be.

257
00:21:53,124 --> 00:21:55,484
但是自从庞培的手下走后他就掌控了这一带
Since Pompey's gangs left he's had the run of the hill.

258
00:21:55,804 --> 00:21:57,594
他现在是大人物了
He's a big man now.

259
00:21:57,624 --> 00:21:58,833
他可以杀掉任何他想杀的人！
He kills whoever he wants!

260
00:21:59,453 --> 00:22:00,923
我可不是一个可以被随意辱骂的穷人！
I'm no prole to be abused!

261
00:22:01,423 --> 00:22:03,353
我可是军团里面的前任军官！
I was prefect in the Evocati!

262
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:06,442
恺撒亲自赠送过一匹马给我
Caesar himself gave me a horse.

263
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,070
感谢你，先生
Thank you, sir.

264
00:22:31,738 --> 00:22:34,998
我希望那顿晚餐没有给你带来过多的痛苦
I hope that dinner was not too painful for you.

265
00:22:34,998 --> 00:22:38,757
哦，我已经习惯痛苦了，我根本就不介意
Oh, I'm used to pain. I don't mind it.

266
00:22:45,836 --> 00:22:48,295
我真希望你以前不是那么在乎他
I wish you didn't care for him so much.

267
00:22:50,195 --> 00:22:53,135
我真希望我以前不是那么在乎你
I wish I didn't care for you so much.

268
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:55,364
别说了
Stop.

269
00:23:12,381 --> 00:23:16,171
你的那个弟弟已经变成了一个动人的男人
That brother of yours has become quite the pretty man.

270
00:23:16,801 --> 00:23:18,940
恺撒似乎很喜欢他
Caesar seems very fond of him.

271
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,670
非常
very much.

272
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,100
母亲说恺撒把他看成情人，
Mother claims Caesar took him for a lover.

273
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:25,694
真的吗？
Really?

274
00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:29,379
厨子说她听见他们在壁橱里面…
The cook said she heard them going at it in a closet.

275
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:31,778
屋大维坚持说那并不是事实
Octavian insisted it was not so.

276
00:23:31,788 --> 00:23:32,878
他说厨娘听见的声音是
He said the noises she heard were

277
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:35,628
恺撒遭受惊人痛苦时发出的声音
some terrible affliction of Caesar's.

278
00:23:35,828 --> 00:23:38,287
母亲根本不信，只要她相信了什么…
Mother wouldn't have it. Once she gets an idea--

279
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:39,987
痛苦？什么痛苦？
Affliction? What affliction?

280
00:23:41,777 --> 00:23:43,856
 我不知道  他没有说吗？
 I don't know.  Did he not say?

281
00:23:44,476 --> 00:23:46,286
他发誓要保密的
He was sworn to secrecy.

282
00:23:47,006 --> 00:23:49,805
但是他说惊人的？他说了惊人的痛苦？
But he said terrible? He said terrible affliction?

283
00:23:50,885 --> 00:23:54,185
你必须要找出到底这种痛苦是什么
You must find out exactly what this affliction is.

284
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:56,434
你必须要找出神到底对他进行了什么诅咒
You must find out which god has cursed him.

285
00:23:56,504 --> 00:23:58,904
我怎么能做到？那是个秘密
How can I do that? It's a secret.

286
00:23:58,974 --> 00:24:01,184
你必须要找出来，这是我在寻找的武器
You must find it out. This is the weapon I seek.

287
00:24:01,184 --> 00:24:03,723
加上神的帮助，我就可以毁灭他
With the god's help, I can destroy him.

288
00:24:03,783 --> 00:24:05,453
请不要这么说
Please don't talk this way.

289
00:24:05,523 --> 00:24:06,823
你想要我对你说谎？
Would you rather I lied to you?

290
00:24:06,883 --> 00:24:08,982
我宁愿你想些别的东西
I would rather that you think of something

291
00:24:09,052 --> 00:24:11,152
而不是如何毁灭我的舅公
other than the destruction of my uncle.

292
00:24:14,051 --> 00:24:16,621
我从来没有骗过你
I have never lied to you.

293
00:24:16,681 --> 00:24:19,221
他对我还是有很大的掌控
He still has some terrible hold over me.

294
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:23,420
我不希望如此，但是他不肯就此算了
I wish it were not so, but he will not let go.

295
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,709
你会问你的弟弟吗？
Will you ask your brother?

296
00:24:31,229 --> 00:24:33,288
那会让你高兴吗？
Would that make you happy?

297
00:24:33,358 --> 00:24:34,858
是的，会的
Yes, it would.

298
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:42,057
你在看什么？
What are you reading?

299
00:24:43,387 --> 00:24:46,256
一个对于奇观解释的导论
A guide to the interpretation of prodigies.

300
00:24:46,316 --> 00:24:48,856
好看吗？
Is it good?

301
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:50,586
除了概念外，很闷
It's dull beyond conception.

302
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:54,255
如果我要成为一个祭司，我必须要熟悉他们无稽的行话
If I am to be a pontiff, I must be familiar with their ludicrous jargon.

303
00:24:54,315 --> 00:24:57,085
 不能让舅公失望  不能让舅公失望
 Mustn't let down Uncle.  Mustn't let down Uncle.

304
00:24:58,264 --> 00:24:59,694
我很无聊
I'm bored.

305
00:25:02,784 --> 00:25:06,083
 我可以读给你听  如果你想的话
 I could read to you.  If you like.

306
00:25:06,793 --> 00:25:09,502
小麻雀，我的爱就是爱
"Little sparrow, my love is love,

307
00:25:09,562 --> 00:25:13,362
跟她玩耍的人允许她躺在大腿上
with whom she plays, permits to lie within her lap,

308
00:25:13,432 --> 00:25:16,561
捏捏她的爪子，咬咬她的啄
to nip her finger, biting quickly with that bill,

309
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:20,291
我应该像她一样跟你玩耍来抚平我杂乱的心
I should like to play with you as she and soothe my troubled heart."

310
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,930
 很好  你不喜欢？
 very nice.  You do not like it?

311
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,900
不，你朗诵的很好，但是…
No, you recite well, but...

312
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,949
我只是对于诗歌厌烦了
I'm tired of poetry.

313
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:36,678
 跟我说个秘密  秘密？
 Tell me a secret.  A secret?

314
00:25:36,678 --> 00:25:39,088
一个令人震惊而又危险无人知道的秘密
Something shocking and dangerous that nobody knows.

315
00:25:39,158 --> 00:25:41,387
我可不知道那种秘密
I don't know any secrets like that.

316
00:25:46,656 --> 00:25:48,086
我知道
I know.

317
00:25:51,586 --> 00:25:55,455
那么说说恺撒跟他的神秘的病痛如何？
What about Caesar and his mysterious affliction?

318
00:25:58,155 --> 00:25:59,654
什么病痛？
What affliction?

319
00:25:59,654 --> 00:26:00,414
别撒谎，就是你跟母亲说的那个
Don't lie. The one you told Mother about.

320
00:26:02,284 --> 00:26:05,883
噢，没那回事，我瞎编的
Oh, it was nothing. I was just making it up.

321
00:26:05,953 --> 00:26:08,633
 那么你们是情人？ 当然不是了
 So you were lovers?  Of course not.

322
00:26:08,723 --> 00:26:12,412
要不你们就是情侣，要不，就是神对于恺撒的诅咒，到底是哪个？
Either you were lovers, or some god has cursed Caesar, which is it?

323
00:26:12,482 --> 00:26:14,612
姐姐，根本没有神 别变得那么令人讨厌
 Sister, there are no gods.  Don't be horrid.

324
00:26:15,142 --> 00:26:18,481
毫无疑问的，一个某种八卦的散布者
There is doubtless a Prime Mover of some sort,

325
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:22,041
但是在我们这个圈子里对于像我们这样的人试图打探八卦？
but a community of beings that look like us and meddle in our affairs?

326
00:26:22,111 --> 00:26:24,910
 似乎是不现实的  你不信任我
 Highly improbable.  You don't trust me.

327
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,980
我相信你，你是我最亲爱的人
I do trust you. You are my dearest friend.

328
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,140
 那么就告诉我！ 为什么一定要知道这个？
 Then tell me!  Why this in particular?

329
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,079
为什么你会在意恺撒是否有病痛？
Why do you care if Caesar has an affliction?

330
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:33,839
我可不在乎什么小细节
I don't care the slightest bit.

331
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:37,138
我只想知道一个大秘密，一个值得一听的东西
Only that it would be a terrible secret and something worth hearing.

332
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:40,477
而且我怀疑你是否有什么惊人秘密能够
And I doubt very much that you have any terrible secrets

333
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,159
值得你说出来的
of your own worth telling.

334
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:48,556
 你的怀疑是错误的  哦，是吗，那么是什么秘密呢？
 You'd be wrong.  Oh please, like what?

335
00:26:50,566 --> 00:26:53,296
 我曾经拷打并且杀死了一个人  骗子
 I've tortured and killed a man.  Liar.

336
00:26:53,566 --> 00:26:55,905
你还记得卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯？
Do you remember Lucius vorenus?

337
00:26:55,965 --> 00:26:58,205
一个在高卢救了我的战士？
One of the soldiers who rescued me in Gaul?

338
00:26:58,265 --> 00:27:00,005
 你杀了他？ 当然没有
 You killed him?  Of course not.

339
00:27:00,065 --> 00:27:01,964
他有个老婆红杏出墙
He has a wife who deceived him.

340
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:04,924
那个他认为是他女儿的孩子，其实
A child he thinks is his daughter's son is in fact

341
00:27:04,934 --> 00:27:07,633
是他老婆跟一个低贱的半希腊血统的屠夫的孩子
his wife's child by a low half-Greek butcher.

342
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:09,113
真是太肮脏了
How sordid.

343
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:13,382
那个屠夫是我杀的，或者说协从杀的
It was the butcher I killed. Helped kill, anyway.

344
00:27:15,532 --> 00:27:18,762
噢，我想，应该很精彩
Oh. Bravo, I suppose.

345
00:27:18,831 --> 00:27:20,831
你自己想要知道一个惊人秘密的
You asked for a terrible secret.

346
00:27:34,729 --> 00:27:36,469
再说一个
Try again.

347
00:27:43,627 --> 00:27:45,957
什么？
What?

348
00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:47,687
让路，让路
Get out of the way!

349
00:27:47,787 --> 00:27:49,527
百夫长！
Centurion!

350
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,496
百夫长！
Centurion!

351
00:27:53,156 --> 00:27:55,216
卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯！
Lucius Vorenus!

352
00:27:57,985 --> 00:28:00,265
卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯！
Lucius Vorenus!

353
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:07,624
内奥比，还是像以前那么可爱
Niobe, looking as lovely as ever.

354
00:28:09,013 --> 00:28:11,323
菲利斯献上她的致意
Phyllis sends her best regards.

355
00:28:16,882 --> 00:28:18,552
你的家人真漂亮
very pretty family you have.

356
00:28:19,452 --> 00:28:22,111
这么久之后能够见到你真是太好了
It's good to see you again after so long.

357
00:28:22,151 --> 00:28:25,481
嗯，打完仗回来了
So, back from the wars.

358
00:28:25,551 --> 00:28:27,950
平民生活，呃？
Civilian life, eh?

359
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,520
肯定很难适应
Must be hard to adjust.

360
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,180
不同的规则
Different rules.

361
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,819
他妈的不同的规矩！
Different fucking rules!

362
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:40,648
我的手下阿宝说你打了他的脸
My man Urbo here says you slapped him in the face.

363
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:42,978
 你那么做了吗？ 是的
 Did you do that?  I did.

364
00:28:42,978 --> 00:28:46,467
完美的例子…不同的规矩
Perfect example- different rules.

365
00:28:46,547 --> 00:28:50,517
你要明白，我有权能够惩罚我的手下
You see, I'm allowed to chastise my people.

366
00:28:55,296 --> 00:28:58,085
像你这样的平头老百姓是不允许碰他的
Regular citizens like you are not allowed to touch them.

367
00:28:58,535 --> 00:29:00,405
如果有人那么做了，那么他就要被惩罚
If someone does touch them, they have to be punished.

368
00:29:00,635 --> 00:29:02,435
这就是规矩
Rules.

369
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:04,104
你到底想说什么
Get to your point.

370
00:29:04,164 --> 00:29:07,764
这已经是第二次了，卢西尔斯，乌瑞纳斯
This is the second time that Lucius vorenus

371
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:10,033
显示了对我的不敬
has shown me disrespect.

372
00:29:10,103 --> 00:29:12,133
下一个集市日的中午
Next market day at noon,

373
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:14,723
他会在市场上找到我
he will find me in the Forum.

374
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,912
他会跪倒在我面前
He will kneel down before me.

375
00:29:18,062 --> 00:29:21,962
他会亲吻我的脚并且向我道歉
He will kiss my feet and he will apologize to me.

376
00:29:23,301 --> 00:29:26,461
如果他不这么做的话我会回到这里把他杀了
If he does not do this, I will come here and kill him.

377
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:31,900
但是他死之前，他会看到他的老婆跟女儿被强奸
But before he dies, he will see his wife and daughters raped.

378
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,310
然后我会烧了这栋房子
And then I will burn down this building.

379
00:29:35,129 --> 00:29:35,999
等等
Hold.

380
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:41,028
 你说完了？  是的
 You've said your piece?  I have.

381
00:29:41,088 --> 00:29:43,888
那么现在就离开吧
Then leave now.

382
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:45,648
祝你日安
Good day to you.

383
00:29:58,856 --> 00:30:02,675
那么卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯的老婆是个婊子，跟我有何关系
So the wife of this Lucius vorenus is a whore. What's that to me?

384
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,425
很抱歉，这就是他所知道的了
I'm sorry, that's all he told me.

385
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:08,224
 他发誓恺撒没有病痛  他在撒谎
 He swears Caesar has no affliction.  He's lying.

386
00:30:08,244 --> 00:30:09,344
那么就是我做的还不够了？
Is it not enough then?

387
00:30:09,394 --> 00:30:11,693
如果恺撒有病痛
If Caesar has an affliction,

388
00:30:12,053 --> 00:30:14,953
他就会因此而痛苦，无论你是否知道
he has it and suffers, whether you know it or not.

389
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:17,323
他在受罪，但是他还没有被毁灭
He suffers, but he is not destroyed.

390
00:30:17,393 --> 00:30:19,792
你必须要回到你弟弟那里，从他的嘴里得到真相
You must go back to your brother and get the truth from him.

391
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:22,752
 怎样做呢？我已经试过了  再试试
 How? I tried.  Try again.

392
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:25,291
答应他一些东西
Promise him something.

393
00:30:26,121 --> 00:30:28,751
你肯定有他想要的东西
You do have something he wants.

394
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,480
你是什么意思？
What do you mean?

395
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,879
一个年轻人会告诉他的爱人任何事情
A young man will tell his lover anything.

396
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:44,238
你肯定是在开玩笑
You can't be serious.

397
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:47,208
你怎么能…？
How can you...?

398
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:51,307
你知道他想要你
You know he wants you.

399
00:30:51,377 --> 00:30:53,437
我就会背叛我的母亲
I would be betraying my brother.

400
00:30:53,447 --> 00:30:55,286
我就会背叛我的家族
I would be betraying my family.

401
00:30:55,446 --> 00:30:57,946
你的家族是满是毒蛇的蛇巢
Your family is a nest of snakes.

402
00:30:57,946 --> 00:30:59,536
你对你的家族没有任何义务
You have no obligations to them.

403
00:30:59,606 --> 00:31:01,835
他们是我的家人，他们爱我，我…
They are my family! They love me, l--

404
00:31:01,905 --> 00:31:03,305
像我爱你那样
As I love you.

405
00:31:03,365 --> 00:31:06,675
你把这个称作爱？
You call this love?

406
00:31:08,464 --> 00:31:10,034
我不能
I can't.

407
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,604
 你去哪里？ 回家
 Where are you going?  Home.

408
00:31:11,634 --> 00:31:12,834
别走
Don't go.

409
00:31:13,303 --> 00:31:15,463
你母亲杀了格雷毕斯！
Your mother killed Glabius!

410
00:31:19,332 --> 00:31:21,502
我的手下抓住了杀他的一个人
My people caught one of the men that did it.

411
00:31:21,562 --> 00:31:23,462
一个泰门手下的人
One of Timon's men.

412
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,159
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

413
00:32:20,473 --> 00:32:23,472
 听莱蒂的话  妈妈，请跟我们一起走
 Do as Lyde says.  Please, Mama, come with us.

414
00:32:23,612 --> 00:32:25,382
我要跟着你的父亲
My place is here with your father.

415
00:32:25,452 --> 00:32:26,812
但是如果你被杀了呢？
But what if you're killed?

416
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:30,011
那么你们必须呆在乡下，不要回到城里
Then you must stay in the country, don't come back to the city.

417
00:32:30,311 --> 00:32:31,751
你明白了吗？
You understand?

418
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:34,580
别回来，你会成为一个乡下的姑娘
Don't come back! You'll be country girls. Mm-hmm?

419
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,929
你的表亲会给你找个又好又英俊的农夫的
Your cousin will find you good handsome farmers to marry.

420
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:46,858
去向神们祈求保佑
Go ask the gods for blessing.

421
00:32:50,978 --> 00:32:53,787
你不能让乌瑞纳斯去请求原谅？
Can't you get vorenus to do as Erastes asks?

422
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,387
如果你求他的话…
If you begged him--

423
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:57,207
去亲吻一个男人的脚？
To kiss a man's feet?

424
00:32:57,287 --> 00:33:00,376
我永远不会求他这么做，而且他永远也不会这么做
I'd never ask such a thing, and he'd never agree to it.

425
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:03,036
永远记住你们是乌瑞纳斯家族的孩子
Always remember that you are children of the vorenii,

426
00:33:03,036 --> 00:33:04,705
一个古老而且值得尊敬的名字
an old and respected name.

427
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:07,085
永远记住我们爱你
And always remember that we love you.

428
00:33:07,205 --> 00:33:11,524
我非常爱你们，现在走吧
I love you very much. Now go on.

429
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:24,232
走，走
Go, go.

430
00:33:27,762 --> 00:33:29,201
再见，姐姐
Goodbye, sister.

431
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,198
艾瑞纳你不打算把桌子收拾一下吗？
Eirene, are you going to leave this mess on the table?

432
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:51,798
内奥比，求你了，跟他们一起走吧
Please, Niobe, please, go with them.

433
00:33:51,858 --> 00:33:54,317
我不会走的，别再让我走了
I will not and stop asking.

434
00:35:00,876 --> 00:35:02,636
这个面包不错
Good bread this.

435
00:35:02,706 --> 00:35:05,406
我买了比较好的那种
I bought the better kind.

436
00:35:05,476 --> 00:35:07,705
还是取决于价格，对吧？
Hang the expense, eh?

437
00:35:18,704 --> 00:35:20,673
滚开，都让路
Get back. Make way there.

438
00:35:20,873 --> 00:35:22,673
快跑到个地方躲起来
Run and hide.

439
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:31,202
执政官大人 盖乌斯·优利乌斯·恺撒
Here comes the Consul Gaius Julius Caesar,

440
00:35:31,272 --> 00:35:33,901
维纳斯之子，盖尔军团的统帅驾到
Son of venus, lmperator of the Gaelic Legions.

441
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,470
你好卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯
Salve, Lucius vorenus.

442
00:36:11,425 --> 00:36:13,525
你的妻子很漂亮
Your wife is very beautiful.

443
00:36:13,595 --> 00:36:14,695
她的名字是？
Her name?

444
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:15,954
内奥比，长官
Niobe, sir.

445
00:36:20,464 --> 00:36:23,763
站起来 内奥比
Rise, Niobe.

446
00:36:27,892 --> 00:36:30,132
我们能够有幸让你喝一口我们家里的水吗？
Would you honor us by drinking our water, sir?

447
00:36:30,452 --> 00:36:31,402
很好
I'm happy to do so.

448
00:36:31,922 --> 00:36:33,921
请坐下
Please, sit.

449
00:36:37,851 --> 00:36:41,050
我总是给予你很高的敬意，乌瑞纳斯
I have always held you in high regard, vorenus,

450
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:44,350
而且我被告知你很受到你手下的尊重
and I am told you are a man of respect among your people here.

451
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,379
 我希望如此  是这样的我来这里是想要你
 I hope so.  That being so, I've come to ask you

452
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:52,348
代表我去做低地的地方长官
to stand for magistrate of Lower Aventine on my slate.

453
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,978
谢谢
Thank you.

454
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,397
那么？
Well?

455
00:37:03,507 --> 00:37:06,546
您的到场给了我极大的荣耀，极大的荣耀
I am deeply honored by your presence here, sir, deeply honored.

456
00:37:07,836 --> 00:37:11,165
但是…我不得不尊敬的表示拒绝
But... respectfully, I must decline.

457
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,775
那么，你还是对于我的行为感到不赞同？
So you still disapprove of my actions?

458
00:37:14,825 --> 00:37:17,204
长官，毫无冒犯之意
Sir, with respect,

459
00:37:17,224 --> 00:37:18,924
您的政治观点跟我的不同
your politics are not mine.

460
00:37:18,934 --> 00:37:20,374
我知道这个
I am aware of that.

461
00:37:20,384 --> 00:37:22,304
如果我是个地方长官的话我将不得不表述
Were I a magistrate, I would have to speak.

462
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:24,103
你将不会表述你对
And you will not speak

463
00:37:24,173 --> 00:37:27,003
专制的好感？
in favor of a tyrant?

464
00:37:27,073 --> 00:37:29,572
我不会说违背我信仰的话的
I will not speak against my beliefs.

465
00:37:29,632 --> 00:37:31,232
味道不错
Delicious.

466
00:37:31,802 --> 00:37:34,062
你错误判断了我…我不是个暴君
You misjudge me. I am no tyrant.

467
00:37:34,132 --> 00:37:36,871
我合法的取得了独裁的权力
I have taken dictator's powers legally.

468
00:37:36,931 --> 00:37:39,971
而且我将会把这些权力归还给人民以及元老们
And I will return those powers to the people and the senate

469
00:37:40,031 --> 00:37:41,870
尽我最快的可能而且除非罗马恢复到它黄金岁月的
as soon as I am able. I will not rest

470
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:46,160
情况，我是不会休息的
until Rome is as it was in the golden age.

471
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:49,309
我无法独自进行下去，你会加入我吗？
I cannot succeed alone. Will you join me?

472
00:38:06,656 --> 00:38:09,356
恺撒，万岁！万岁！
Hail Caesar! Hail!

473
00:38:09,426 --> 00:38:11,096
恺撒，万岁！
Hail Caesar!

474
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:18,414
恺撒，恺撒，恺撒！
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

475
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,947
Alittle more, Ithink.

476
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,353
No, the sleeves are fine, leave those alone.

477
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:48,881
You just be careful what you're doing with that pin.

478
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:51,326
Yes. Now, if you could go around the side--

479
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:52,954
at the hem, at the bottom--

480
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,090
that needs taking up a little bit there.

481
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,760
There. No, that's fine.

482
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:00,965
I don't know. That just isn't working for me.

483
00:39:16,745 --> 00:39:19,275
你在找什么吗？
Were you looking for anything in particular?

484
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:22,764
呃…并不是
Oh... not really.

485
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,131
你有什么好笑的事情吗？
Do you have anything comical?

486
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:41,731
嗯，我想是没有
Um, I don't think so.

487
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,930
你
You.

488
00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:54,699
为什么让他走？这儿很热
Why send him away? It's hot.

489
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:57,368
我不喜欢他看我
I don't like that one. He looks at me.

490
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:00,158
是吗？让卡斯特教训他
Does he? Have Castor beat him.

491
00:40:00,228 --> 00:40:01,758
可能我会这么做
Maybe I will.

492
00:40:03,827 --> 00:40:06,757
 我叫另外一个过来  别
 I'll call for another one.  Don't.

493
00:40:07,757 --> 00:40:09,856
单独呆在一起很好啊
It's nice to be alone.

494
00:40:11,926 --> 00:40:13,026
是吗？
Isn't it?

495
00:40:15,495 --> 00:40:18,755
 我猜是吧  过来跟我躺在一起
 I suppose.  Come lie down with me.

496
00:40:19,355 --> 00:40:21,734
跟你躺在一起？为什么？
Lie down with you? Why?

497
00:40:23,594 --> 00:40:25,754
你会喜欢的
I would like it.

498
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:28,393
 为什么？ 为什么不会？
 Why?  Why not?

499
00:40:28,453 --> 00:40:30,523
我可以想到好几个原因
I can think of several reasons.

500
00:40:30,593 --> 00:40:33,723
你小的时候每晚都跑到我的床上
When you were little, you would come to my bed every night.

501
00:40:34,072 --> 00:40:36,762
不是每晚，只是在我害怕的时候
Not every night. Only when I was scared.

502
00:40:37,082 --> 00:40:38,392
你总是很害怕
You were scared a great deal.

503
00:40:38,432 --> 00:40:39,722
我现在不害怕
I'm not scared now.

504
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,880
 假装  我可不善于假装
 Pretend.  I have no skill at pretending.

505
00:40:57,349 --> 00:40:59,548
我现在很困窘
I'm embarrassed now.

506
00:41:00,948 --> 00:41:03,148
我以为你想要我
I thought you wanted me.

507
00:41:08,707 --> 00:41:10,847
你是个男人了，对吧？
You're a man now, aren't you?

508
00:41:14,206 --> 00:41:15,876
你可以任取所求
You can take what you want.

509
00:42:12,766 --> 00:42:14,796
弟弟，告诉我一件事
Brother, tell me something...

510
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,736
唉
Ah.

511
00:42:17,796 --> 00:42:20,035
唉是什么意思？
What do you mean, "Ah"?

512
00:42:22,055 --> 00:42:24,095
现在就是回报时间了
Now comes the price.

513
00:42:26,694 --> 00:42:29,224
 你是什么意思？ 你是个有道德的女人
 What do you mean?  You're a virtuous woman,

514
00:42:29,294 --> 00:42:32,023
那么你应该知道诱惑你弟弟是一个错误
so you must know that seducing your own brother is wrong.

515
00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:35,893
你跟我已经越过了那个卑微的社会习俗
You and I are above such petty social convention.

516
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:38,292
但是乱伦不仅仅是违背了社会习俗
But incest is not merely wrong by convention.

517
00:42:38,352 --> 00:42:41,292
它从本质上就是错的，错的
It's wrong in essence. It must be,

518
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,621
否则的话，为什么乱伦者的孩子里面有那么多的白痴跟怪胎？
else why so many idiots and monsters among the children of incest?

519
00:42:44,691 --> 00:42:47,881
 别  别担心
 Don't.  Don't worry.

520
00:42:47,951 --> 00:42:49,920
我不太可能会让你怀孕
It's unlikely I've seeded you.

521
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,320
不是在满月的时候
Not with the moon in transit.

522
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:55,130
关键在于，你不是个为了肉欲能够做这种错事的女人
The point is, you're not the woman to do such wrong out of mere lust.

523
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,229
所以，你肯定有其他的企图
Ergo, you must have another purpose.

524
00:42:57,289 --> 00:43:02,048
我猜你应该是对恺撒的健康又有了新的非常奇怪的兴趣吧
I suspect you shall renew your strange interest in Caesar's health.

525
00:43:04,518 --> 00:43:07,987
我…我都做了什么？我都做了什么？
Wha- what have I done? What have I done?

526
00:43:10,957 --> 00:43:13,827
我都做了什么？什么？
What have I done? What?

527
00:43:16,786 --> 00:43:21,585
你都做了什么？告诉我
What have you done? Tell me.

528
00:43:22,855 --> 00:43:24,385
答应我
Promise.

529
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,854
答应我你不会跟母亲说
Promise you won't tell Mother.

530
00:43:45,371 --> 00:43:47,141
看看你
Look at you.

531
00:43:47,201 --> 00:43:49,271
你看起来就像要洗的衣服
You look like laundry.

532
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,000
那里
There.

533
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,399
看起来还可以吗
 Does it look well?  very well.

534
00:43:57,399 --> 00:43:59,129
非常好
It feels strange.

535
00:43:59,129 --> 00:43:59,869
感觉很奇怪

536
00:44:00,899 --> 00:44:03,269
不，别，你会弄脏它的
No, don't, you'll dirty it.

537
00:44:03,329 --> 00:44:07,128
从后面看好看吗
Does it hang properly at the back?

538
00:44:07,498 --> 00:44:09,528
我也这么认为
I think so.

539
00:44:34,453 --> 00:44:35,883
冷静，母亲，说真的
Calm down, Mother, really.

540
00:44:35,943 --> 00:44:38,613
冷静？我还没有开始发火呢
Calm down? I have not even begun to get angry!

541
00:44:41,552 --> 00:44:43,582
够了
Enough!

542
00:44:43,592 --> 00:44:45,252
我是你儿子，不再是孩子了
I am your son but not your child.

543
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:47,681
 你不能再打我了  我不能？
 You will not strike me anymore.  Will I not?

544
00:44:49,381 --> 00:44:51,751
你干了你姐姐，你这个变态！
You fucked your sister, you little pervert!

545
00:44:51,811 --> 00:44:54,110
别跟我说什么可以，什么不可以做！
Don't tell me what I will and will not do!

546
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:57,070
 都住口！！  你敢吗
 Be quiet!!  You wouldn't dare.

547
00:45:09,978 --> 00:45:12,547
你们怎么能做这样的事情？
How could you do this to me?

548
00:45:12,617 --> 00:45:15,017
我自己的孩子
My own child.

549
00:45:15,077 --> 00:45:18,026
 你杀了我丈夫  我跟你说过，不是吗？
 You killed my husband.  I told you, didn't l?

550
00:45:18,036 --> 00:45:20,346
 我跟你说过 我没有杀他！ 你在撒谎
 I told you I didn't kill him!  You're a liar.

551
00:45:20,816 --> 00:45:23,046
赛维莉娅抓住了动手的一个人
Servilia caught one of the men that did it.

552
00:45:23,745 --> 00:45:26,335
 一个泰门的手下  那么那个人在哪里？
 One of Timon's men.  And where is this man?

553
00:45:26,335 --> 00:45:27,645
你亲自问过他吗？
Did you speak to him?

554
00:45:28,705 --> 00:45:30,944
看着我，看着我！
Look at me. Look at me!

555
00:45:32,074 --> 00:45:35,344
我以先祖的名义发誓
I swear on the spirits of my ancestors,

556
00:45:35,344 --> 00:45:39,203
朱庇特可以为证，我没有杀你的丈夫！
on the stone of Jupiter, I did not kill your husband!

557
00:45:39,373 --> 00:45:41,903
你为了个谎言而作践自己！
You abased yourself for a stupid lie!

558
00:45:44,372 --> 00:45:47,472
 我不知道  赛维莉娅才是骗子，你这个蠢人！
 I don't know.  Servilia is the liar, you fool!

559
00:45:47,542 --> 00:45:49,871
她骗你来跟我作对
She lied to turn you against me.

560
00:46:00,969 --> 00:46:02,939
我可怜的小羔羊
My poor lamb.

561
00:46:30,395 --> 00:46:31,794
艾瑞纳？
Eirene?

562
00:46:34,964 --> 00:46:37,024
艾瑞纳！
Eirene?

563
00:46:39,095 --> 00:46:41,154
Eirene!

564
00:46:44,932 --> 00:46:46,562
来了，主人
Coming, master.

565
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:55,321
坐下来跟我一起喝两口
Sit down. Have a drink with me.

566
00:47:16,087 --> 00:47:18,087
你的头发跟我母亲的很像
My mother had hair like yours.

567
00:47:20,926 --> 00:47:23,116
虽然眼睛是灰色的
Grey eyes though.

568
00:47:23,186 --> 00:47:25,986
大大的灰色的眼睛
Big grey eyes.

569
00:47:28,475 --> 00:47:32,015
奴隶…在北边的一块农场
Slave... on one of those farms up north.

570
00:47:34,324 --> 00:47:35,724
闻起来有松树的味道
Smelled of pine trees.

571
00:47:36,344 --> 00:47:38,144
大概工作在木场里
Worked in the wood yards, probably.

572
00:47:38,214 --> 00:47:42,773
我想这就是为什么闻起来有松树的味道
That's what I think. Explains the pine smell.

573
00:47:45,702 --> 00:47:48,172
不知道我父亲是谁
Don't know who my father was.

574
00:47:48,242 --> 00:47:50,402
可能就是另外一个奴隶而已
Just another slave probably.

575
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:56,541
一些胆小的混球都敢骑在他的头上拉屎
Some timid cunt shoveling shit with a collar around his neck

576
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:58,780
因为他没有男人应有的勇气
because he didn't have the courage to die like a man.

577
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,940
如果让我向任何人屈膝
I'd cut my fucking heart out of my chest

578
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,630
我会挖出我的心脏然后吃点它
and eat it before I knelt down to anybody!

579
00:48:03,739 --> 00:48:05,759
 混蛋！ 安静！
 Cunt!  Quiet!

580
00:48:05,919 --> 00:48:07,979
小声点！
Keep it down!

581
00:48:08,049 --> 00:48:10,108
都去死吧，你们这帮混蛋
Suck my cock, the lot of youse!

582
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,778
我是泰特斯·波罗对吧？
I'm Titus Pullo, right?

583
00:48:18,167 --> 00:48:19,827
没错吧？
Right?

584
00:48:21,627 --> 00:48:23,596
没错，主人
Right, master.

585
00:48:24,966 --> 00:48:26,926
你是个好姑娘
You're a good girl.

586
00:48:29,895 --> 00:48:31,695
但是你不常笑
You don't smile much though.

587
00:48:33,865 --> 00:48:35,724
你想要我笑？
You want me to smile?

588
00:48:35,994 --> 00:48:37,894
我想要你开心
I want you to be happy.

589
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:44,693
这样好多了
That's better.

590
00:48:46,922 --> 00:48:48,762
喝点酒
Have some wine.

591
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:01,950
到这来
Come here.

592
00:49:17,438 --> 00:49:18,837
到这来
Closer.

593
00:49:28,016 --> 00:49:29,776
脱掉你的衣服
Take off your dress.

594
00:50:28,096 --> 00:50:29,936
为什么戴帽子？
What's the hat for?

595
00:50:29,996 --> 00:50:31,825
赎罪日
Yom Kippur.

596
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:33,665
噢，是今天吗？
Oh, is that today?

597
00:50:33,725 --> 00:50:35,365
你也称自己是犹太人？
You call yourself a Jew?

598
00:50:35,425 --> 00:50:37,195
怎么，你现在要当我的老师？
What, are you my Rebbe now?

599
00:50:47,023 --> 00:50:50,222
 让路，让路！ 动手！
 Move! Move!  vos!

600
00:50:54,022 --> 00:50:55,292
不！
No!

601
00:50:56,751 --> 00:50:59,091
快，抓住她！
Quick, grab her!

602
00:50:59,161 --> 00:51:01,561
扒光她！
Strip her!

603
00:51:01,621 --> 00:51:04,820
不！不！
No! No!

604
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,690
谁来帮帮她！
Somebody help her!

605
00:51:13,289 --> 00:51:14,589
来救救我

606
00:51:14,589 --> 00:51:17,418
救我，保护我，救我，保护我
...keep and protect me. Keep and protect me.

607
00:51:21,937 --> 00:51:24,547
来救我，来救救我，保护我

608
00:51:24,617 --> 00:51:26,317
不！
Keep and protect me. No!

609
00:51:26,987 --> 00:51:28,486
我们走！
Let's go!

610
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:06,548

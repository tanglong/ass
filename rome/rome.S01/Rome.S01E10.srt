1
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,992
天哪
Dear me,

2
00:01:52,152 --> 00:01:54,592
我从来没看过这么多张拉长的脸聚在一起
I've never seen so many long faces.

3
00:01:54,652 --> 00:01:57,612
出席葬礼的传统就是要表现出悲哀
It is customary to be sad at a funeral.

4
00:01:57,622 --> 00:02:00,851
是啊，共和国已经腐朽老化
Well, the Republic is old and infirm.

5
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,651
在这种时候，死亡反而是种解脱
Death can be a merciful release in such cases.

6
00:02:03,651 --> 00:02:05,711
这不是你的本意
You do not mean that.

7
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,301
你不是这么想的
You don't believe that.

8
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,550
你们不应该开有关独裁的玩笑
You of all people shouldn't lay jokes

9
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,950
我可是认真的
 about tyranny.  Oh, I am deadly serious.

10
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,700
归顺于恺撒
It is in all our interests

11
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,020
既符合我们的利益
to be reconciled with Caesar now,

12
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,489
也是为了罗马好
for the good of Rome.

13
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:21,959
真正的为罗马好
The good of Rome indeed.

14
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:25,289
一旦这场闹剧结束
As soon as this... farce is done,

15
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:27,289
我就隐退到乡下
I shall retire to the country

16
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:29,918
看着这座城市慢慢的恢复过来
and wait for the city to come to its senses.

17
00:02:29,988 --> 00:02:32,318
这是保留尊严的唯一办法了
It is the only honorable thing to do.

18
00:02:32,688 --> 00:02:34,318
得了，我的朋友
My dear friend,

19
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:36,318
我们早就没有尊严
we have no honor.

20
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:38,358
如果我们还有尊严
If we had honor, we would be

21
00:02:38,418 --> 00:02:41,157
早就和卡托，西比乌一起死了
with Cato and Scipio in the afterlife.

22
00:03:10,694 --> 00:03:15,754
首先，元老院将听取马库斯·图里亚斯·西赛罗的发言
First, Senate will hear Marcus Tullius Cicero.

23
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:26,293
在这个荣耀的凯旋庆典日之前
On this eve of his most glorious triumph,

24
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:29,422
我推举盖乌斯·优利乌斯·恺撒
I move that Gaius Julius Caesar

25
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:31,422
未来十年内
be made lmperator

26
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:34,152
作为拥有无上权力的
and granted absolute power over Rome

27
00:03:34,222 --> 00:03:36,292
罗马元首
for a period of 10 years.

28
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,959
正如大家所知道的
As some of you know,

29
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:08,388
恺撒和我也有过意见不合的时候
Caesar and I have had our disagreements.

30
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:19,687
尽管如此
However that may be,

31
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:21,857
他还是在
he has shown himself

32
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:24,727
胜利之后体现了他的明智和大度
to be as wise and merciful in victory

33
00:04:24,787 --> 00:04:27,856
正如他在战场上无往不胜一般
as he was invincible in battle.

34
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:31,326
让这场内部的矛盾
Let this be an end

35
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:35,096
早日结束吧
to division and civil strife.

36
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:39,295
我将向恺撒献出我的忠诚
I willingly pledge my loyalty to him,

37
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:43,125
也希望所有人都如此
and I urge you all to do the same.

38
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:45,125
我由衷的赞成
I heartily commend

39
00:04:45,195 --> 00:04:47,124
马库斯·图里亚斯·西赛罗
the motion proposed

40
00:04:47,194 --> 00:04:49,824
提出的建议
by Marcus Tullius Cicero.

41
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:09,462
提议得到全票通过
The motion is carried unanimously.

42
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:20,691
在座的很多人
Many of you here today

43
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:23,091
都曾经和我对立
fought against me.

44
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,360
很多人希望看到我死
Many of you wished me dead.

45
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,690
也许很多现在仍然如此
Many of you perhaps still do.

46
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,490
但我并不介意
But I hold no grudges

47
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,260
也不打算报复
and seek no revenge.

48
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:39,429
我只要求你们
I demand only this--

49
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:43,889
和我站在一起
that you join with me

50
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,728
建立一个新的罗马
in building a new Rome,

51
00:05:47,358 --> 00:05:49,158
一个新的罗马
a Rome that offers

52
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:51,758
能让他所有的公民们都
justice, peace and land

53
00:05:51,828 --> 00:05:53,758
生活在公平，和平和富饶的土地上
to all its citizens,

54
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:56,527
而不只是那些特权阶级
not just the privileged few.

55
00:05:56,597 --> 00:05:59,457
帮助我完成这项使命
Support me in this task,

56
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:02,157
过去的分歧都既往不咎
and old divisions will be forgotten.

57
00:06:03,227 --> 00:06:05,427
如果你反对我…
Oppose me...

58
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:09,996
罗马将不会给你第二次机会
and Rome will not forgive you a second time.

59
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:15,056
元老们…
Senators...

60
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:21,795
战争已经结束
the war is over.

61
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,800
女主人
Domina.

62
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,026
Mmm?

63
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,990
朱莉娅·阿提娅来了
Atia of the Julii is here.

64
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,059
阿提娅？
Atia?

65
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:18,829
是的，已经到了
Here, now.

66
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:21,359
她想见见你
She wishes to see you.

67
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:24,229
阿提娅…
Atia...

68
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:26,228
在我的房子里？
in my house?

69
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:38,667
亲爱的阿提娅
My dear Atia.

70
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,827
见到你实在太好了
How lovely to see you.

71
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:46,596
亲爱的
Bona dea.

72
00:07:48,796 --> 00:07:50,726
我可怜的朋友
My poor friend.

73
00:07:58,735 --> 00:08:00,565
他们都对你做了些什么？
What have they done to you?

74
00:08:00,735 --> 00:08:02,665
你太客气了
You're so sweet.

75
00:08:02,735 --> 00:08:04,474
坐下吧
Come sit down.

76
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,934
抱歉我没有早点来看你
I'm very sorry I haven't visited sooner,

77
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:11,334
说实话，我是因为心情太差而没早来见你的
but to be honest, I was far too upset to face seeing you.

78
00:08:11,394 --> 00:08:14,633
一个贵妇被扒光了衣服在大街上被羞辱
The very idea, it's- it's too sinister.

79
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:17,933
这个画面一直在我脑海中挥之不去，实在是太邪恶了
A noblewoman stripped naked and beaten on the streets--

80
00:08:17,993 --> 00:08:20,033
太可怕了，太可怕了
horrible. Horrible.

81
00:08:20,093 --> 00:08:21,933
告诉我，你现在怎么样了？
Tell me truly, how are you now?

82
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:24,042
我恢复的很好
I'm recovering very well.

83
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:27,092
他们找到动手的人了吗？
Have they found the culprits yet?

84
00:08:27,162 --> 00:08:30,732
还没有，不过因果报应总有时
They have not, but justice will find them eventually.

85
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:32,792
我相信这点
I'm quite sure of that.

86
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:36,761
要来点柠檬水么？
Would you have some lemon water?

87
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:40,461
好的
That would be lovely.

88
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,330
 布鲁图斯还好吧？ 他很好
 Brutus is well, I hope.  He is.

89
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,860
他向我的叔叔屈服实在是太明智了
It's so wise of him to choose submission to my dear uncle.

90
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,200
我很怕他会为了所谓的勇猛
I was very afraid he might try

91
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,839
干出一些鲁莽的事情来
some foolish act of bravery.

92
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:59,429
男人总是会为了尊严干点蠢事
Men are so silly about their honor. No?

93
00:09:03,198 --> 00:09:05,298
我来是想问你
I've come to ask you

94
00:09:05,368 --> 00:09:07,728
你愿意在凯旋庆典时和我坐在一起吗？
if you will sit with me at the triumph.

95
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,098
很多吹嘘拍马之徒都在我身边
Even though I'm being besieged by sycophants

96
00:09:10,098 --> 00:09:12,278
乞求我给他们一个位子，但我不这么想
asking for space, I thought, "No,

97
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:14,557
我第一想到的人
if someone were to have first choice,

98
00:09:14,557 --> 00:09:16,287
就是我的好朋友赛维莉娅
it should be my dear friend Servilia

99
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:19,727
她经历了这么多的痛苦
who's been through so much pain."

100
00:09:20,097 --> 00:09:22,796
你想的真是周到…
That is very thoughtful of you...

101
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:26,936
但我认为我不够资格
but I think I shall not be well enough.

102
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:29,866
真遗憾…
Well, that's a pity.

103
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,536
 你真的这么想吗？ 是的
 Are you sure?  I am.

104
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:34,665
 好吧，如果你回心转意的话… 我会告诉你的
 Well, if you change your mind-  I will let you know.

105
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:39,935
有人告诉我奥克塔维娅离开了城里
People tell me that Octavia's left the city,

106
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:42,194
但没人知道她去了哪
but no one knows where.

107
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:44,164
希望别出什么事了
I hope there's nothing amiss.

108
00:09:45,364 --> 00:09:47,294
别担心
Not at all.

109
00:09:47,364 --> 00:09:49,764
她呆在我表兄在帕斯图的一幢别墅里
She's staying at my cousin's villa in Paestum,

110
00:09:49,764 --> 00:09:52,663
和一个她遇到的愚蠢的年轻诗人在一起呆着
mooning over some young fool of a poet she's met there.

111
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:55,363
凯旋庆典之时她就会回来
She'll be back in time for the triumph.

112
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:19,001
弟弟
Brother.

113
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:21,680
你来这里干什么？
What are you doing here?

114
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,300
我是来带你回家的
I've come to take you home.

115
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,110
 这里就是我的家  这里？
 This is my home.  This? This is not your home.

116
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,700
这不是你的家
I'm happy here.

117
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,680
我在这很愉快

118
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,299
我可不相信
I don't believe you.

119
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:35,659
无论如何，和家人在一起的地方才是你的家
In any case, your place is with your family.

120
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:37,869
离开家庭是愚蠢的
Bad enough to run away,

121
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,619
和这些人一起生活？
but to these people? This isn't the healthy way of life.

122
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:41,318
这样的生活方式是不健康的

123
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:43,498
你认为我们家很健康吗？
You call our family healthy?

124
00:10:43,568 --> 00:10:47,268
从大地上都能嗅出我们家的腐败
Our corruption stinks in the nostrils of Mother Earth.

125
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:49,508
这都是那些愚蠢祭司的说法
This is your foreign priests talking.

126
00:10:51,697 --> 00:10:54,767
他们都是骗子，只是想要你的钱
They are frauds. They only want your money.

127
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:57,797
祭司在这里不是别的，都是仆人而已
Priests are nobody. They are just servants here.

128
00:10:57,797 --> 00:10:59,697
这是圣母的领地
This is the Great Mother's house.

129
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:02,166
圣母对我没有他求
The Great Mother wants nothing from me.

130
00:11:02,236 --> 00:11:05,266
 我在她眼中只是渺小的虫子罢了  你可不是什么虫子
 I'm a worm in her sight.  You are not a worm.

131
00:11:05,336 --> 00:11:07,536
你是朱利亚家的女儿
You are a daughter of the Julii.

132
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:11,065
你变成这样实在让人看的心疼
It looks very ill, you running away like this.

133
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:13,405
如果让大众知道的话
Reflects badly on the whole family

134
00:11:13,415 --> 00:11:14,835
会给我们家造成极大的不良影响
if it were known publicly.

135
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:19,235
我还以为你是期盼我回去
For a moment I thought you wanted me back

136
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:22,104
 是因为你很想我  别傻了
 because you missed me.  Don't be silly.

137
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:24,364
我们都很想你
We've missed you terribly.

138
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,414
母亲也很想你
Your mother has missed you.

139
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:29,154
我相信仆人和那些小动物们也期盼着你回去
I believe even the servants and animals

140
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:30,294
还有你？
 have missed you.  And you?

141
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:35,903
当然还有我
And I.

142
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:43,522
我很想你
I've missed you.

143
00:11:46,132 --> 00:11:48,732
我不能回去
I can't go back.

144
00:11:48,802 --> 00:11:50,731
已发生的事情是无法挽回的了
What's done is done.

145
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:53,471
我原谅你了，还有母亲也原谅你
I forgive you. Your mother forgives you.

146
00:11:55,401 --> 00:11:57,341
你原谅我？
You forgive me?

147
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:58,871
母亲原谅我？
Mother forgives me?

148
00:11:59,491 --> 00:12:02,070
如果我并不原谅你们呢？
What if I don't forgive?

149
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,820
不论你认为她做了什么
Whatever you think she may have done,

150
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:08,410
想一下这都是她出于对你的爱
consider the possibility she did it out of love for you.

151
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,939
我永远不会原谅她
I'll never forgive her.

152
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:14,399
就算是那样，你的宽恕也无关紧要
Be that as it may, your forgiveness is irrelevant.

153
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:16,469
你必须回家
You must come home.

154
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,969
对不起
I'm sorry,

155
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:20,938
我不回去
I will not.

156
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:24,138
我不想使用武力
I don't want to use force.

157
00:12:24,738 --> 00:12:27,438
祭司们会保护我的
The priests will protect me.

158
00:12:28,618 --> 00:12:30,137
他们不会的
They won't.

159
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:32,537
我已经收买了他们
I've bought them.

160
00:12:32,707 --> 00:12:34,237
很便宜的价格
Quite cheaply.

161
00:12:35,807 --> 00:12:37,237
求你了
I beg you,

162
00:12:37,307 --> 00:12:39,336
让我留在这里吧
Iet me stay here.

163
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:45,226
你都干了些什么？
What have you done?

164
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:54,935
艾文泰的居民们
Fellow citizens of the Aventine!

165
00:12:58,765 --> 00:13:01,004
居民们
Fellow citizens!

166
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:06,234
艾文泰的居民们
Fellow citizens of the Aventine!

167
00:13:08,274 --> 00:13:11,733
我的名字是卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯
My name is Lucius vorenus,

168
00:13:11,803 --> 00:13:15,073
斯特拉提纳族人，第13军团的退伍军人
tribe of Stellatina, veteran of the 1 3th Legion.

169
00:13:15,073 --> 00:13:18,373
你们中的某些人也许认识我
Some of you may know me.

170
00:13:18,802 --> 00:13:21,242
我给你们带来了好消息
I bring you good news.

171
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:24,872
恺撒已经结束了贵族们的苛政
Caesar has put an end to patrician tyranny,

172
00:13:24,932 --> 00:13:27,302
他确定民众们的声音
and will ensure that the common people

173
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:29,411
 将会再次得到尊重  滚回高卢去吧
 be heard once more.  Go back to Gaul, ginger knob.

174
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,111
生姜头

175
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:35,601
我不会否认，我的朋友我的外表看起来的确是高卢人
I'll not deny it, friend, I have a Gallic look about me,

176
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:37,901
但我确实是个罗马人
but I'm as solid Roman as you are.

177
00:13:37,971 --> 00:13:40,270
我为罗马抛头颅撒热血
I've shed blood for Rome.

178
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,270
我的父亲也为罗马浴血奋战
My father shed blood for Rome,

179
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,940
我的祖父和曾祖父同样如此
as did his father and his father before him.

180
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,469
我的妻子，是在这里出生的，在艾文泰
My wife- my wife was born here in the Aventine!

181
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:51,639
我和这里的所有其它人一样，是一个罗马人
I am as solid a Roman as any man here!

182
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:59,108
如果我被选为你们的地区长官
If I am elected as your local magistrate,

183
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,168
我以朱庇特石的名义起誓
I promise on Jupiter's stone

184
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:03,538
努力创造出一个和平
to strive to make this an era of peace,

185
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:05,538
繁荣，公正的时期
prosperity and justice

186
00:14:05,608 --> 00:14:07,538
为所有的艾文泰居民
for all Aventine.

187
00:14:08,297 --> 00:14:09,717
明天
Tomorrow

188
00:14:09,737 --> 00:14:12,607
恺撒将会举办一个凯旋庆典
Caesar holds a triumph,

189
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:15,077
作为他对于罗马人民爱的见证
a symbol of his love for the people of Rome.

190
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,097
笑话！
 Cac!  Why don't you shut up, you--

191
00:14:16,097 --> 00:14:17,736
你为什么不闭上你的嘴，你…

192
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:19,736
保持风度，夫人，保持风度
Ladylike, madam, ladylike.

193
00:14:19,806 --> 00:14:22,406
五天的盛会和娱乐
Five days of feasting and games

194
00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:25,536
是对罗马人民给予
as appreciation for the trust and support

195
00:14:25,606 --> 00:14:27,536
恺撒的理解和支持的回报
the people of Rome have given Caesar.

196
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:30,575
自由，准确的说，我们把自由都给了他
Freedom, more like! We've given him our freedom

197
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:33,005
还有尊严
and our honor!

198
00:14:33,075 --> 00:14:35,705
如果我不相信和了解恺撒
I would not be standing here on Caesar's slate

199
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,274
才是这个国家的救星
if I did not believe, if I did not know

200
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:42,834
我也就不会站在这里为他说话了
that he has only the Republic's best interests at heart.

201
00:14:46,904 --> 00:14:48,543
“一个新的时代”
"A new era."

202
00:14:48,603 --> 00:14:50,343
“明天的凯旋庆典，是一个新的时代的开始”
"Tomorrow's triumph, a new era."

203
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:54,473
明天的凯旋庆典，是一个新的时代的开始
With tomorrow's triumph, a new era begins.

204
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:58,002
对于所有艾文泰的人以及所有的罗马人
For all Aventine. For all Rome.

205
00:15:06,971 --> 00:15:08,971
 很好，你做的很不错  谢谢
 It was good. You did well.  Thank you.

206
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:29,239
高卢人的王
King of all the Gauls.

207
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:32,739
让你有些想法，不是吗？
Makes you think, doesn't it?

208
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,109
确实如此
It does.

209
00:15:45,238 --> 00:15:47,037
再见了，老朋友
Goodbye, old friend.

210
00:15:49,577 --> 00:15:52,577
尽量把他收拾的干净些，他看上去已经是个死人了
Do your best to tidy him up. He looks dead already.

211
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:49,341
总算找到你们了，混蛋
Found you at last, you bastards.

212
00:16:49,411 --> 00:16:52,570
 我找遍了整个军队  赫赫有名的泰特斯·波罗
I've been through the whole damned army. The famous Titus Pullo.

213
00:16:52,571 --> 00:16:53,630
是什么让我们有这种荣幸呢，公民？
To what do we owe this honor, citizen?

214
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,640
是来祝福我们好运的吗？
Do you come to wish us luck?

215
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,810
听着，我大部分的装备都还在，就是头盔找不到了
Listen, I've got most of my kit, but I've lost my crest.

216
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,180
肯定有人有多余的吧，你们说那？
Surely someone's got a spare, you think?

217
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,079
只是个头盔罢了，又不是失去了剑
It's only a crest. It's not like I lost my sword.

218
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:07,939
你不能跟参与我们的阅兵式
Well, you can't march with us.

219
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:10,439
你已经离开了军团，你自己要离开的
You've left the Legion. You signed yourself out.

220
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:12,839
我知道，但是永远是13军的人，不是吗？
I know, but... 13th forever, eh?

221
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:15,538
只有军人可以参加凯旋庆典，你只是个公民
It's enlisted men only in the triumph. You're a civilian.

222
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:17,538
公民？
Civilian?

223
00:17:18,108 --> 00:17:20,208
我是军团的英雄
I'm the hero of the whole mumping Legion, I am.

224
00:17:20,278 --> 00:17:22,068
我不止一次的救了你
I saved your skin more than once. Shouldn't have to remind you of that.

225
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:23,568
我想这不用我来提醒你

226
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:25,947
如果你想要再当几年兵的话，那就另当别论
If you want to sign up for a few more years,

227
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:28,347
你可以加入阅兵式，直到你走到脚肿
that's a different story. You can march with us till your feet are nubs.

228
00:17:28,437 --> 00:17:30,787
我为13军流的血难道还不够吗？
Haven't I spilled enough blood for the 13th?

229
00:17:30,787 --> 00:17:32,387
别那样
Don't be like that.

230
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:34,746
不是我他妈定的规矩，对吗
I don't fucking make the rules, do l? I follow them.

231
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:36,246
我只是执行罢了
It's enlisted men only. Don't push it.

232
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,906
只有军人可以参加，别推到我头上来

233
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,706
如果宴会结束之后你想过来，我可以请你点喝的，嗯？
If you come by after, I'll stand you some drinks, eh?

234
00:17:42,476 --> 00:17:45,075
请我喝点？
Stand me some drinks?

235
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:47,935
我可不想和你这样的人一起喝什么酒
I've got better things to do than go drinking

236
00:17:47,965 --> 00:17:50,945
好啊，走吧，公民
 with the likes of you.  Well, walk on then, citizen.

237
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:52,645
走！
Walk on!

238
00:17:54,045 --> 00:17:56,474
好了，伙计们，精神点
Right, ladies, on your feet!

239
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:58,544
是时候拿出点军人的样子来了！
Time to look like soldiers!

240
00:18:10,513 --> 00:18:12,683
这会不会太繁琐了一些？
Is this too much?

241
00:18:13,143 --> 00:18:15,672
 在我看来，正好  我不这么看…
 Just enough, I'd say.  I don't know.

242
00:18:16,242 --> 00:18:19,012
我认为这紫色太刺眼了，我想让人感到紫色（王权）
I think it's too purple. I want to suggest purple

243
00:18:19,082 --> 00:18:21,012
但不想穿着紫色
without actually wearing it.

244
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:23,642
在光线照射下，不会看上去太刺眼
It will look less loud in direct light.

245
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:26,611
 你怎么看？ 朱庇特再世
 What do you think?  Jupiter in life.

246
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:29,311
毫无二致
Resemblance is uncanny.

247
00:18:31,881 --> 00:18:33,710
有什么东西让你感到好笑吗？
What do you find amusing?

248
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,810
很荒缪，不是吗？
It's absurd, isn't it?

249
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,010
盛装打扮，扮演成神的样子
Dressing up, playing at being God?

250
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,709
扮演？
Playing?

251
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,049
我可不是在扮演
I'm not playing.

252
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:49,849
这可不是什么游戏
This is not a game.

253
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:52,649
如你所想
As you wish.

254
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:54,708
这不是游戏
It is not a game.

255
00:18:56,778 --> 00:18:58,528
来点红色的
Something more red.

256
00:19:00,178 --> 00:19:03,148
 斗技场周围的水沟都灌满了吗？ 是的
 Is the canal around the circus filled?  It is.

257
00:19:03,157 --> 00:19:04,467
昨天晚上还没好呢
It was not last night.

258
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,227
 今天早上就已经好了  很好
 I saw to it at first light.  very good.

259
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:09,827
要保证大象们在合适的时候吃药
Make sure the elephants are given their emetics in good time.

260
00:19:09,877 --> 00:19:12,827
我可不想因为这些巨大的蠢东西让我的战车放慢脚步
I don't want my chariot slowed by giant turds.

261
00:19:20,776 --> 00:19:23,015
你看起来好多了
You are looking much better.

262
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:26,115
我自己倒没那个感觉
I am not better, however.

263
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:29,715
也许我必须送你到乡下去
Well, I must get you out to the country, perhaps.

264
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:31,515
一点…
Some fresh air and sunshine would do you good.

265
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:34,294
新鲜的空气和阳光对你有好处

266
00:19:35,544 --> 00:19:38,984
总在床上躺着可不是办法
This lying abed is not healthy.

267
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:42,314
有事情做的时候我才起床
I rise when I have reason to do so.

268
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:48,783
别在这虚情假意了
Don't loiter here pretending to be solicitous.

269
00:19:49,543 --> 00:19:52,412
到你朋友那种污秽的聚会上去吧
Go to your friend's obscene display.

270
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:54,032
母亲…
Mother...

271
00:19:58,242 --> 00:20:00,282
走！
Go.

272
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:09,711
走！
Go.

273
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:56,416
脸颊上需要再上点颜色吗？
Do you want some color on your cheeks?

274
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:12,814
求你了，亲爱的
Please, darling,

275
00:21:12,884 --> 00:21:15,384
说话吧
say something.

276
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,814
这种可怕的沉默
This horrid silent business,

277
00:21:18,864 --> 00:21:20,973
真是让人不安
it's most upsetting.

278
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:26,643
 他们对你做了点什么？ 他们什么都没做
 What did they do to you?  They did nothing.

279
00:21:27,613 --> 00:21:30,982
她终于说话了，这是个好的开始
She speaks. There's a start.

280
00:21:31,712 --> 00:21:33,652
他们对我很好
They were very kind to me.

281
00:21:33,712 --> 00:21:35,712
好到让你像对待猪肋肉一样
Kind enough to let you hack away at yourself

282
00:21:35,982 --> 00:21:38,152
伤害自己
Iike a side of pork.

283
00:21:41,881 --> 00:21:44,481
我可怜的小脾气鬼
My poor little grump.

284
00:21:46,011 --> 00:21:48,651
我直到现在才发现我是多么的想念
Oh, I didn't realize until now how much I missed

285
00:21:48,711 --> 00:21:51,180
你着这里忧郁的存在
your gloomy presence around the place.

286
00:22:19,348 --> 00:22:21,287
女主人…
Domina...

287
00:22:21,647 --> 00:22:23,977
有个乞丐在门口，自称是昆特斯
there's a beggar at the door who says he is Quintus,

288
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:25,727
庞贝的儿子
natural son of Pompey.

289
00:22:25,747 --> 00:22:27,957
来寻求您儿子的保护
He asks for your son's protection.

290
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,646
把他赶走
Send him away.

291
00:22:32,086 --> 00:22:34,016
 放开！ 滚出去！
 Take your hands off me!  Get out!

292
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:35,926
布鲁图斯
Brutus!

293
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:39,216
不敢跟我见面吗？懦夫？
Scared to talk to me, eh, coward?

294
00:22:39,286 --> 00:22:41,215
你是个懦夫，布鲁图斯
You're a coward, Brutus!

295
00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:43,915
我以门神的名义起誓
I swear by Janus,

296
00:22:43,915 --> 00:22:46,115
朱庇特还有朱诺（朱庇特之妻）
Jupiter and Juno,

297
00:22:46,415 --> 00:22:49,415
我在我父亲的墓碑前发誓
I swear on the grave of my father,

298
00:22:49,784 --> 00:22:54,084
我，昆特斯·维拉里斯·庞贝
I, Quintus valerius Pompey,

299
00:22:54,154 --> 00:22:57,084
我要杀了那个暴君
I'm going to kill that son of a whore tyrant!

300
00:22:57,154 --> 00:23:00,783
我让阿贾克斯去打发他走
I'll get Ajax to deal with him

301
00:23:00,983 --> 00:23:02,633
 他是罗马的叛国贼  等等
 He's a bastard traitor to Rome...  Wait.

302
00:23:03,213 --> 00:23:06,083
你也是叛徒，布鲁图斯
and you're a traitor too, Brutus!

303
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:23,381
庞贝的儿子，对吗？
Pompey's natural son, eh?

304
00:23:23,451 --> 00:23:25,881
我就是
I am.

305
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:29,250
我想你肯定不是恺撒的朋友
I gather at least you're still no friend to Caesar.

306
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,250
我要把他活活烧死
I'll burn him alive.

307
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,620
我要把他的眼睛挖出来
 I will pluck out his eyes, l-  Shh shh.

308
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,520
冷静些
Be calm.

309
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,849
这里的人都是你的朋友
You're among friends.

310
00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:47,789
一切都会好起来的
Allwill bewell.

311
00:24:16,016 --> 00:24:18,056
带他沐浴，给他弄点吃的
Have him washed and fed.

312
00:26:40,621 --> 00:26:42,621
恺撒！恺撒！
Caesar! Caesar!

313
00:27:20,527 --> 00:27:22,457
伟大的恺撒！
Glorious Caesar!

314
00:27:44,525 --> 00:27:46,524
神眷顾你，恺撒！
The gods favor you, Caesar!

315
00:29:35,363 --> 00:29:37,363
恺撒！恺撒！
Caesar! Caesar!

316
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:18,699
能够容纳5000个人的桌子
"Tables for 5000 men

317
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:22,029
会放在广场上
will be set up in the cattle forum.

318
00:30:22,498 --> 00:30:26,448
奴隶和自由身的人没有资格加入
Slaves and freedmen are not eligible.

319
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:32,088
那些没有位子坐的平民必须在
Those citizens that cannot find a proper seating place must leave

320
00:30:32,127 --> 00:30:34,997
市政长官要求的时候离开
when ordered by the civic officers.

321
00:30:34,997 --> 00:30:38,990
盖乌斯·优利乌斯·恺撒已宣布
Gaius Julius Caesar has decreed

322
00:30:38,997 --> 00:30:42,556
为了感谢大家的崇高美德
in tribute to their virtue,

323
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:45,256
每一个罗马的臣民
each and every citizen of Rome

324
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:48,526
都将从国库得到
will be issued from the public treasury

325
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:52,195
100便士
the sum of 100 denarii."

326
00:30:54,165 --> 00:30:55,875
除此之外
"Further,

327
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:59,355
20,000户应受奖励的家庭
20,000 deserving families

328
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:01,205
将得到在卡普阿
will be given farms

329
00:31:01,325 --> 00:31:05,154
附近的农田
on the public lands around Capua."

330
00:31:06,124 --> 00:31:08,624
除此之外，来年
"Further, for the coming year,

331
00:31:08,694 --> 00:31:11,763
所有的租金
all rents- all rents

332
00:31:11,823 --> 00:31:13,733
城里底层人们的所有的租金
on low dwellings in the city

333
00:31:13,793 --> 00:31:15,993
都将由
will be paid in full

334
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:20,033
盖乌斯·优利乌斯·恺撒支付
by Gaius Julius Caesar."

335
00:31:20,093 --> 00:31:22,032
高贵极了
very noble

336
00:31:22,092 --> 00:31:25,432
我想这实在是太完美的表述了
and very nicely expressed, if I may say so.

337
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:27,432
我们能私下聊聊吗？
Might I have a quiet word?

338
00:31:27,492 --> 00:31:29,002
当然
Of course.

339
00:31:30,332 --> 00:31:33,431
私下聊
A quiet word.

340
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,431
你可以当着昆特斯的面说
Oh, you may speak in front of Quintus.

341
00:31:35,491 --> 00:31:37,431
好吧，我要说的就是昆特斯
As you wish. It is of Quintus I speak.

342
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:40,631
这家伙来这也有几天了吧
The good man has been here several days now.

343
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:44,460
也是时候可以走人了吧
Perhaps he grows weary of entertaining us with his happy presence.

344
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,460
别介意，昆特斯，他就是这么缺乏礼貌
Do not mind him, Quintus. He has no manners.

345
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:52,559
只要他还能让我高兴，他就可以住在这里
He shall stay as long as it pleases me.

346
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:54,829
问题就在这里，母亲
Well, that's the thing, Mother.

347
00:31:55,099 --> 00:31:57,029
我没有发现他有任何
I do not see in what way he could

348
00:31:57,099 --> 00:31:59,529
可以让您高兴的地方
possibly please you.

349
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:02,198
他的目的是什么？
What is his purpose?

350
00:32:02,258 --> 00:32:05,598
他能说明您写诗吗？
Does he help you to write poetry?

351
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:08,098
 他是一个好的聆听者  是吗？
 He has a good ear.  lndeed? Hmm.

352
00:32:08,368 --> 00:32:12,167
 真让我意外  他有着火热的内心
 You surprise me.  He has fire in him.

353
00:32:12,427 --> 00:32:14,197
让我感到温暖
It warms me.

354
00:32:14,207 --> 00:32:17,027
如果觉得冷就多点灯
Light more lamps if you are cold!

355
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:20,886
让庞贝的儿子呆在我们家里很不舒服
It looks very ill to keep a son of Pompey in our house.

356
00:32:20,896 --> 00:32:24,066
我们应该以此为傲！
And we should strike such fine figures otherwise!

357
00:32:35,165 --> 00:32:36,115
你瞧
So you see, the fourth clause

358
00:32:36,515 --> 00:32:38,515
这上级法令的第四个条款
of the previous statute only applies in cases of fire and flood,

359
00:32:38,525 --> 00:32:40,924
只在火灾和洪水时候

360
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:43,164
或者是符合附录中的规定的时候才适用
unless otherwise stipulated in the appendix.

361
00:32:43,184 --> 00:32:45,544
 明白了吗？ 不是很清楚
 Do you see?  Not clearly.

362
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:49,164
我没有办法解释的更简单了
I'm not sure I can explain it in simpler terms.

363
00:32:49,244 --> 00:32:51,443
这些可以等选举结束后再讨论
Surely this can wait until after the election.

364
00:32:51,463 --> 00:32:53,963
如果我输了，学这些有什么用？
There's no point learning all this if I lose.

365
00:32:54,033 --> 00:32:55,793
你不会输的
You will not lose.

366
00:32:55,863 --> 00:32:58,793
为什么你这么肯定？还有其它候选人
You're very sure of that. There are other candidates.

367
00:33:01,132 --> 00:33:03,332
我想我警告过你嘲笑我是什么后果
I believe I warned you about mocking me.

368
00:33:03,392 --> 00:33:06,102
请原谅，先生，但我以为你已经了解了这个制度
Forgive me, sir. I had thought you understood the system.

369
00:33:06,162 --> 00:33:09,102
其它候选人都只是凑数的
The other candidates are straw men.

370
00:33:10,051 --> 00:33:11,571
凑数的？
Straw men?

371
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:14,581
但是如果没有反对者
It saves a great deal of useless strife

372
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:17,131
当然能够避免无意义的竞争，但只有恺撒的人
if there's no opposition, but it would look ill

373
00:33:17,141 --> 00:33:19,361
站出来又会显得太突兀
if Caesar's man was the only one standing.

374
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,830
这些事实让你困扰吗？
These facts disturb you somehow?

375
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,830
选举是由神圣的朱庇特神监督的
The elections are sanctioned by Jupiter Capitolinus.

376
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,329
选举可是庄严的事情啊
They are sacred.

377
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:32,899
恺撒也是由朱庇特神指派的，不是吗？
Caesar also is sanctioned by Jupiter, is he not?

378
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,799
有预兆，有胜利的凯旋
By augury, by triumph,

379
00:33:35,869 --> 00:33:37,599
也有人民的拥护
by acclaim of the people.

380
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,698
他所作的一切，都是由神庇护的
Anything he does is sacred.

381
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:43,698
某种程度上，他就是神本身
In a way, he is a demigod.

382
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:46,038
仅仅在那一天而已
For one day only.

383
00:33:46,268 --> 00:33:49,167
其它日子里，他和你我一样，都是凡人
For the rest, he is a mortal man like you and me.

384
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:51,477
不管他是不是凡人，他在试图拯救共和国
Mortal or not, he is trying to save the Republic.

385
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,517
通过贿赂选举？
By corrupting the elections?

386
00:33:53,557 --> 00:33:56,567
罗马人民可没有期盼干净的选举
The Roman people are not crying out for clean elections.

387
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:58,767
他们期盼的是工作
They are crying out for jobs.

388
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,996
他们期盼的是甘甜的水和食物
They are crying out for clean water, for food,

389
00:34:01,066 --> 00:34:03,296
和平稳定的生活
for stability and peace.

390
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:06,436
你可以为人们做到这些
You can do great things for your people.

391
00:34:06,496 --> 00:34:08,436
你可以帮助恺撒
You can help

392
00:34:08,496 --> 00:34:10,695
拯救共和国
save the Republic.

393
00:34:14,565 --> 00:34:17,905
或者你可以回到你的小店铺去继续卖你的羊肉跟猪肉
Or you can go back to your shop and resume selling mutton and pig,

394
00:34:17,965 --> 00:34:20,004
满手污泥却保持一颗高尚的心
have dirty hands but a clean conscience.

395
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:32,333
你怎么想？
So what do you say?

396
00:34:34,163 --> 00:34:35,653
什么？
Say to what?

397
00:34:35,663 --> 00:34:37,833
你根本没在听我说什么
You haven't heard a word I've been saying.

398
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:39,792
没事吧？
Is everything all right?

399
00:34:39,802 --> 00:34:41,502
原谅我
Forgive me.

400
00:34:44,802 --> 00:34:46,842
那…你需要什么？
So what was it you needed?

401
00:34:48,801 --> 00:34:51,381
我想让艾瑞纳脱离奴籍，带她去乡下过日子
I want to free Eirene, take her off to the country,

402
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:53,531
 如果你能借我点钱  当然可以
 if you'll lend me some money.  Of course.

403
00:34:53,601 --> 00:34:55,701
我还想让你陪我一起去奴役登记处
And I'll need you to come with me to the slave registry,

404
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:57,591
用你的名字做我的担保人
 to vouch your name for my ownership.  Slow down. Why are you freeing Eirene?

405
00:34:57,591 --> 00:34:59,060
等一下，你为什么要让艾瑞纳脱离奴籍？

406
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,440
如果她是奴隶我就不能娶她
 Can't marry her otherwise.  Marry her?

407
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,070
娶她？

408
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,700
听着…我…
Look, I've--

409
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,769
我最近…很消沉…
I've been feeling strange and low

410
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:12,839
这几个月来一直是这个样子
and empty these last months, and...

411
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:18,098
不管怎么样，我现在是想通了，我明白我为什么会这样了
anyway, I've puzzled it out, and I realized what it was.

412
00:35:19,498 --> 00:35:21,938
我爱艾瑞纳
I love Eirene.

413
00:35:21,998 --> 00:35:24,468
我爱她，我想和她一起拥有我们的孩子
I love her, and I want her to bear my children

414
00:35:24,528 --> 00:35:26,498
让她做我的妻子…
and be my wife, and...

415
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:33,737
我想我只能说恭喜了…
Congratulations, I suppose.

416
00:35:36,697 --> 00:35:40,316
那么…你说你要去乡下？
So you'll be going to the country, you say?

417
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:43,106
要离开罗马？
Leaving Rome?

418
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,706
罗马不是我应该呆的地方
Rome's no place for me.

419
00:35:44,766 --> 00:35:47,435
我需要新鲜的空气，自由的空间
I need clean air, room to move.

420
00:35:47,955 --> 00:35:50,265
那么你到了乡下打算靠什么谋生？
And what will you do when you get there?

421
00:35:50,735 --> 00:35:52,835
一个强壮的男人到哪都能有口饭吃
There's always work for a good man with a sword.

422
00:35:53,665 --> 00:35:55,805
好吧，既然你已经打定主意了…
Well, as long as you're sure.

423
00:35:58,864 --> 00:36:00,604
我都考虑清楚了
Oh, I've thought it through.

424
00:36:01,364 --> 00:36:03,664
我这辈子从来没有这么肯定过
I've never been so sure of anything in my life.

425
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:07,563
我为你高兴
I'm happy for you.

426
00:36:08,243 --> 00:36:10,233
希望你找到自己生活的路
I hope you find your path.

427
00:36:15,903 --> 00:36:17,432
怎么还呆在这里？
Still here? I thought you were

428
00:36:17,582 --> 00:36:20,472
我还以为你已经为了你的尊严隐居乡下了呢
retiring to the country as a point of honor.

429
00:36:20,532 --> 00:36:22,332
你尽可以嘲笑我
You do right to mock me.

430
00:36:22,642 --> 00:36:24,812
你让我感到渺小
You make me feel small.

431
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:26,142
开个玩笑，老人家，只是个玩笑
A joke, old man, a joke. I'm always happy for your company.

432
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,931
有你在我总是感到快乐

433
00:36:28,001 --> 00:36:31,661
那么…你为什么不事先告诉我
So, why didn't you tell me beforehand?

434
00:36:31,701 --> 00:36:33,331
我至少可以给你提供一点帮助
I could have been of assistance perhaps.

435
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:34,741
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

436
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:38,190
所有人都在看这个
Everyone is reading it!

437
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,170
我从神殿里的女奴那拿到的抄本
I saw some temple prostitutes with a copy.

438
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,370
“觉醒吧！道德”
"A call to virtue."

439
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,699
文章本身是没有什么问题
The writing is... adequate, which is something

440
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:48,799
只是有些地方我们得讨论一下，但是观点却是十分
we should talk about, but the sentiments are

441
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:50,949
高贵和勇敢的
full of grace and bravery.

442
00:36:50,969 --> 00:36:53,769
共和国的子民，先辈的血液
"Sons of the Republic, the blood of our forefathers

443
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,568
呼唤着你们不要遗忘过去，行动起来…
calls you to honor the memory and emulate the deeds

444
00:36:57,338 --> 00:36:59,958
波卡斯·卡托，最后一个真正的罗马人
of Porcius Cato, the last true Roman."

445
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,908
谁写的这个？
Who wrote this?

446
00:37:01,968 --> 00:37:03,968
你写的
You did.

447
00:37:09,907 --> 00:37:11,607
神灵保佑我们！
Gods beneath us!

448
00:37:12,367 --> 00:37:13,887
母亲！！
Mother!

449
00:37:15,637 --> 00:37:16,706
母亲…你读过这个了吗？
Mother, have you seen this?

450
00:37:17,506 --> 00:37:20,436
这篇疯狂的东西？
This lunacy?

451
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:21,836
我当然看过了
Of course I've seen it.

452
00:37:21,846 --> 00:37:23,246
这不是什么疯狂
It's not lunacy.

453
00:37:23,306 --> 00:37:26,875
这是在暴政的统治下
It is a cogent defense of Republican principles

454
00:37:26,905 --> 00:37:29,465
对共和国原则的扞卫
against the forces of tyranny.

455
00:37:30,295 --> 00:37:32,145
我为此感到骄傲
I am rather proud of it.

456
00:37:32,155 --> 00:37:33,575
是你写的？
You wrote this?

457
00:37:34,435 --> 00:37:36,174
用我的名义？
In my name?

458
00:37:36,184 --> 00:37:37,934
卡西亚斯
Cassius contributed

459
00:37:37,934 --> 00:37:39,934
给文章修饰了一下
several nice turns of phrase.

460
00:37:40,034 --> 00:37:41,974
你肯定认得卡西亚斯
You know Cassius, of course.

461
00:37:42,034 --> 00:37:44,454
很高兴见到你，当然
Of course. Delighted.

462
00:37:45,993 --> 00:37:47,493
昆特斯
Quintus.

463
00:37:48,123 --> 00:37:49,393
很高兴再次见到你
It's lovely to see you again.

464
00:37:49,403 --> 00:37:51,733
 好久不见了  是啊…
 It's been too long.  lndeed.

465
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,763
请原谅…
You will excuse me

466
00:37:54,043 --> 00:37:56,602
我想和我妈妈私下谈谈
if I speak with my mother privately?

467
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,271
我很抱歉让你失望了…
I'm deeply sorry you feel I have failed you,

468
00:38:06,341 --> 00:38:08,741
但是这也做的太过分了
but this- this is going too far.

469
00:38:08,801 --> 00:38:11,141
你不能就这样用我的名义…
My name is not yours to be used--

470
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:12,841
你没有让我失望
You haven't failed me.

471
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:14,870
你永远不会让我失望，因为我是你的母亲
You can't fail me, I'm your mother.

472
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,000
 你只是让共和国失望了  我的老天啊！
 You have failed the Republic.  Dear gods!

473
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,240
把笔和纸给我拿来
Bring me a pen and paper. It's bad enough

474
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,340
让那个疯子腔昆特斯

475
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,049
留在这里已经够糟糕的了
that you keep that little madman Quintus in this house,

476
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,139
但是这个！
but this- this!

477
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,209
 我不知道我该如何向他解释  你为什么不跪下来
 I don't know what to tell him.  Why don't you

478
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:35,928
亲吻他的脚，请求他的宽恕？
fall on your knees and kiss his feet and beg for mercy?

479
00:38:36,268 --> 00:38:38,208
 你过去曾经这样成功过  但你呢？
 It served you in the past.  But not you.

480
00:38:38,268 --> 00:38:41,148
也许你恳求的不够中肯
Eh? Perhaps you did not beg hard enough.

481
00:38:55,186 --> 00:38:56,236
你…
You...

482
00:38:57,066 --> 00:39:00,046
你明白吗…
you do understand...

483
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:05,335
他也许会为了这个而杀了我？
he might have me killed for this?

484
00:39:08,735 --> 00:39:12,575
罗马已经沦落到了一个恶魔的手里
Rome has fallen into the hands of a corrupt monster.

485
00:39:12,635 --> 00:39:14,324
你
You, direct descendant

486
00:39:14,324 --> 00:39:16,334
作为共和国建立者

487
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,344
的直系后代
of the father of the Republic,

488
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:21,834
应该做点什么
what do you do?

489
00:39:28,373 --> 00:39:30,483
你想让我怎么做？
What would you have me do?

490
00:39:30,573 --> 00:39:32,303
想想你父亲会怎么做吧？
What would your father have done?

491
00:39:32,313 --> 00:39:34,142
你的祖父会怎么做？
What would his father have done? Would they bend their knees

492
00:39:34,142 --> 00:39:36,422
他们会向一个暴君下跪吗？
 to a tyrant?  They would take account

493
00:39:36,622 --> 00:39:37,902
他们至少会
of the specific circumstan--

494
00:39:37,902 --> 00:39:39,342
审时度势…

495
00:39:39,402 --> 00:39:43,172
他们会象疯狗一样赶走这个暴君！
They would chase him out of the city like any mad dog.

496
00:39:43,441 --> 00:39:45,591
赶走他？
Chased him out?

497
00:39:46,811 --> 00:39:48,941
那么我应该如何做呢？
And how am l to do that exactly?

498
00:39:49,111 --> 00:39:51,471
你不是孤单一人
You would not be alone.

499
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:53,740
啊，对，这个屋子里的这些人
Ah, these fine men in the house

500
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,740
都非常优秀，这点我相信
are very very good. I am reassured.

501
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,610
他们是很棒，还有其它许多人也很棒
They are good men. And there are many others,

502
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,770
有头脑，有智慧的那些人
men of rank and wisdom.

503
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,839
那可不是什么疯狗
It is not a dog gone mad.

504
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:08,009
我宁愿疯狂也不愿玷污我们的名声
I would rather be mad than disgrace our name.

505
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:10,169
别说了
No more!

506
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:14,478
把你的那些追随者赶走
You send your fool henchmen away...

507
00:40:15,108 --> 00:40:17,308
忘了这件愚蠢的事情
and forget this insanity.

508
00:40:23,377 --> 00:40:26,337
 布鲁图斯  卡西亚斯，再见到你真的很高兴
 Brutus.  Ah, Cassius, it's lovely to see you,

509
00:40:26,407 --> 00:40:28,277
但是…如你所见…
but, as you can see--

510
00:40:28,297 --> 00:40:30,537
当然，请原谅我们擅自拜访
Of course, forgive the intrusion.

511
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:32,936
也许我们应该改天拜访
Perhaps I may visit another time.

512
00:40:33,006 --> 00:40:34,946
很好，当然
Good. Certainly.

513
00:40:37,176 --> 00:40:39,406
在朱庇特石的名义下，你是一个罗马公民
On Jupiter's stone, you're a full Roman citizen,

514
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:42,485
你愿意为这个男人列出这些他拥有的财产做担保吗？
and you attest to this man's ownership of listed property?

515
00:40:42,575 --> 00:40:44,135
当然，我愿意
I am. I do.

516
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,075
在这里签字
Sign here.

517
00:40:51,045 --> 00:40:52,904
任何记号都可以了
Any kind of mark will do.

518
00:40:53,864 --> 00:40:56,074
我会写我自己的名字！
I can write my name as good as the next man.

519
00:41:04,743 --> 00:41:06,373
好了
Done.

520
00:41:08,003 --> 00:41:10,473
42,42号过来
42. 42 up.

521
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,072
艾瑞纳
Eirene.

522
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:24,171
过来，我想和你谈谈
Come over here. I want to talk to you.

523
00:41:25,411 --> 00:41:27,331
我让你们单独聊聊
I'll leave you to it.

524
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:35,110
我刚去了奴隶登记处，你已经不在是我的奴隶了
I've been to the registrar of slaves. You're no longer my slave.

525
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:35,980
你把我卖了？
You've sold me? Oh, please don't sell me.

526
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,680
请别把我卖掉

527
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,680
别把我送走，我求你了
Don't send me away. I beg you.

528
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,669
我让你自由了
I'm setting you free.

529
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,499
你自由了，你可以看看这里
You're free. It says so here.

530
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:51,179
谢谢
Thank you.

531
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:53,738
太谢谢你了，你是这个世界上最好的人
Thank you. You're the kindest man alive.

532
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:57,918
我爱你，先生 我爱你，先生
I love you, sir. I love you, sir.

533
00:41:57,918 --> 00:42:00,358
这里有件衣服
Here. Here. It's a dress.

534
00:42:01,757 --> 00:42:02,757
拿去试试吧
Um, go try it on.

535
00:42:02,777 --> 00:42:04,517
让我们看看合不合适
Let's see how it looks.

536
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:29,685
泰特斯·波罗先生我简直不知道应该如何感谢你
Titus Pullo, sir. I cannot thank you enough.

537
00:42:29,685 --> 00:42:32,304
谢我？为什么？
Thank me? What are you thanking me for, boy?

538
00:42:32,304 --> 00:42:33,064
你让她自由了
For freeing her. We have been saving to buy our freedom,

539
00:42:33,414 --> 00:42:35,664
我们一直在存钱打算为自己赎身

540
00:42:35,714 --> 00:42:38,624
但我们没想过一切来的是那么快
but we never- to happen so soon.

541
00:42:38,624 --> 00:42:40,713
这简直是上天赐给我们的礼物
I cannot tell you what a gift it is.

542
00:42:40,713 --> 00:42:42,653
你们一起存钱？你和艾瑞纳？
You've both been saving? You and Eirene?

543
00:42:42,653 --> 00:42:44,453
我们想过要用乌瑞纳斯
We thought to take the vorenus name as ours

544
00:42:44,453 --> 00:42:46,453
作为我们自由后的姓氏
when we became freedmen,

545
00:42:46,703 --> 00:42:49,583
但是艾瑞纳说必须以你的名义
but Eirene says it must be under your name

546
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:51,372
她才做我的妻子
she becomes my wife.

547
00:42:54,502 --> 00:42:56,012
妻子？
Wife?

548
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,242
我是说，法定的妻子
Legal wife, I mean.

549
00:42:57,242 --> 00:43:00,191
我们早就在心中结为夫妻了
We are already married in our hearts.

550
00:43:00,191 --> 00:43:02,691
艾瑞纳？我的艾瑞纳？
Eirene? My Eirene?

551
00:43:03,131 --> 00:43:03,891
先生？
Sir?

552
00:43:05,371 --> 00:43:06,351
先生？
Sir!

553
00:43:35,548 --> 00:43:36,638
死了？
 Dead?  Looks like.

554
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:37,848
看起来是…
 What happened?  I killed him. I did it.

555
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:39,398
怎么了？

556
00:43:39,398 --> 00:43:41,247
我杀了他，是我干的

557
00:43:41,307 --> 00:43:44,007
我知道，但是为什么，为什么要这么做？
I can see that, but why? Why did you do this?

558
00:43:44,017 --> 00:43:45,097
没所谓了
 It doesn't matter.  It does matter, though.

559
00:43:45,097 --> 00:43:46,097
怎么会无所谓
It matters to me. This boy was my property.

560
00:43:46,287 --> 00:43:47,637
这关系到我

561
00:43:47,637 --> 00:43:49,946
这家伙是我的财产

562
00:43:50,016 --> 00:43:52,376
 他激怒了我  他激怒了你？
 He angered me.  He angered you?

563
00:43:52,446 --> 00:43:54,616
他…他和艾瑞纳，他们是…
He- he and Eirene, they were--

564
00:43:56,116 --> 00:43:58,916
那又有关系？难道你以为她是处女吗？
So what does that matter? Did you think she was a virgin?

565
00:43:58,976 --> 00:44:00,715
她依然是你的，你可以拥有她
She's still yours to use as you wish.

566
00:44:01,175 --> 00:44:03,015
我爱她
I love her.

567
00:44:03,075 --> 00:44:04,745
你这就是爱的证明？
This is how you prove it?

568
00:44:04,815 --> 00:44:08,145
这可不是停尸房，随便让你杀人的地方
This is no charnel house to kill people as you want.

569
00:44:08,215 --> 00:44:10,614
这是我的房子，我的家！
This is my home. My home!

570
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,250
Shh.

571
00:44:14,344 --> 00:44:17,314
你在我的孩子面前干出这样的事情？！
You do this violence before my children?!

572
00:44:17,384 --> 00:44:19,013
对不起…
I'm sorry.

573
00:44:25,043 --> 00:44:26,653
我会赔偿你的
I'll pay you back.

574
00:44:27,743 --> 00:44:29,942
你用什么来赔偿，你这个傻瓜
Pay me back with what, you damn fool?

575
00:44:30,012 --> 00:44:32,332
除了我给你的钱，你一无所有
You've got no money but what I've given you.

576
00:44:33,012 --> 00:44:34,412
但是请你…
But please...

577
00:44:36,342 --> 00:44:37,982
别叫我傻瓜
do not call me a fool.

578
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:40,381
我就是要这么叫你，你这个傻瓜
I'll call you what I like. You're a damn fool.

579
00:44:40,451 --> 00:44:42,351
我不在乎钱…
I don't care about the money.

580
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:44,911
但你这么做太失礼了
It's the disrespect.

581
00:44:44,981 --> 00:44:46,951
看看你都干了些什么，看看他！
Look at what you did! Look at him!

582
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:50,580
也许你是对的
Maybe you're right.

583
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,650
也许我是个傻瓜
Probably am a fool.

584
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:56,550
永远都没有办法像你那么聪明
Never was a clever one like you.

585
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,409
从来没有降过职，从来没有受过处罚，从来没有被关过禁闭
Never demoted, you, never flogged, never locked up.

586
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:01,409
一直在往上爬
Straight to the top.

587
00:45:01,879 --> 00:45:03,649
看看现在的你
And here you are,

588
00:45:03,879 --> 00:45:06,249
穿着干净，漂亮的官袍
with your nice, clean, white toga.

589
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:08,248
不管你内在是多么的肮脏
Lovely cloth, that.

590
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:13,248
外表始终是那么的光鲜亮丽
Stays clean no matter how much you wade in the filth.

591
00:45:13,548 --> 00:45:15,128
想说什么就直说
 Speak your mind.  As you will.

592
00:45:15,128 --> 00:45:19,517
好吧，你曾经说过恺撒是个叛徒
Time was, you said Caesar was a rebel and a traitor.

593
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:23,447
他给了你钱和土地，但是现在呢？
And now, today, he tosses you some coin and some farmland,

594
00:45:23,547 --> 00:45:24,887
他变成了共和国的救世主
and he's savior of the Republic, and you're kissing his royal ass.

595
00:45:24,987 --> 00:45:26,597
你在他面前极尽阿谀奉承之能事

596
00:45:28,516 --> 00:45:30,446
你给我站起来！
You stand up.

597
00:45:30,516 --> 00:45:33,476
站起来！站起来！
Stand up! Stand up!

598
00:45:34,516 --> 00:45:36,686
我不想和你打
I'll not fight you.

599
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,885
那就滚！
Then go.

600
00:45:40,945 --> 00:45:42,945
离开这里，永远别回来！
Go and do not come back here.

601
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:54,984
走，走，别回到这里来！
Go. Go! And do not come back here.

602
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:57,753
艾瑞纳，我很抱歉，我很抱歉…
Eirene, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

603
00:46:02,013 --> 00:46:03,853
离她远点…
Stay away from her.

604
00:46:04,213 --> 00:46:06,113
好吧
Right.

605
00:46:08,782 --> 00:46:10,482
对不起…
Sorry.

606
00:46:15,552 --> 00:46:17,481
我完全不知情
I had no idea.

607
00:46:17,551 --> 00:46:19,031
我要走了
I must go now.

608
00:46:19,781 --> 00:46:20,861
你…
You- you do believe me?

609
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,701
你相信我？

610
00:46:22,711 --> 00:46:24,671
我亲爱的朋友，我当然相信你
My dear friend, of course I believe you.

611
00:46:24,691 --> 00:46:26,291
你从来不会对我撒谎
You have never lied to me.

612
00:46:26,311 --> 00:46:28,300
除此之外，为什么你要把你的名字签上去
Besides, why would you put your name to a thing

613
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,190
 然后又否认呢？ 是的，正是如此
 and then deny it?  Well, exactly.

614
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:33,920
但是任何人都可以利用我的名字
And anyone- anyone may forge my name to a thing

615
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,780
来使某些东西招人耳目
to give it weight.

616
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,779
我想我们必须开始习惯
We shall just have to become used to it, no doubt.

617
00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:42,719
我很想知道是谁写的
I wonder who it was that wrote it.

618
00:46:42,979 --> 00:46:45,179
我也是
I wish I knew.

619
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:48,878
一定是个有天赋的人 我还真是很少见到
Someone of talent. Anyhow, I've seldom seen

620
00:46:48,948 --> 00:46:50,888
能够把一件坏事表述得如此好的人呢
a bad case so well put.

621
00:46:50,948 --> 00:46:52,678
也许我该回击他
I shall have to write a reply.

622
00:46:52,748 --> 00:46:56,318
其实，只要你跟我能够明白我们的立场
Well, as long as you and I know where we stand.

623
00:46:56,387 --> 00:46:58,537
我们的立场？
Where do we stand?

624
00:47:00,147 --> 00:47:02,087
我希望我们还是最好的朋友？
I hope we are the best of friends. Are we?

625
00:47:02,147 --> 00:47:04,087
当然，我们当然是
We are, we are.

626
00:47:04,147 --> 00:47:09,186
布鲁图斯，我从来没有质疑过你的友谊和忠诚
Brutus, I have never doubted your friendship or fidelity.

627
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:13,186
即便是我们互相对立的时候
Even when we were enemies.

628
00:49:56,649 --> 00:49:58,139
泰特斯·波罗
Titus Pullo.

629
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:01,389
你看起来疲惫极了
You look tired, my friend.

630
00:50:01,409 --> 00:50:02,489
我喝醉了
 I'm drunk.  These are hard times for war veterans.

631
00:50:02,489 --> 00:50:05,028
现在，战场上的老兵不吃香了

632
00:50:05,028 --> 00:50:07,768
你说得对
You're right there.

633
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:09,598
太多的士兵回到罗马
Too many soldiers back in Rome.

634
00:50:09,608 --> 00:50:12,758
却没有那么多的工作，世道真是不行了
Not enough work to go round. It's a sad situation.

635
00:50:12,818 --> 00:50:14,317
有你这样的好身手
But it's a crime

636
00:50:14,457 --> 00:50:17,957
却流离失所，简直是罪过
to see a man of your ability unemployed.

637
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:22,127
我很好
I'm doing fine.

638
00:50:23,356 --> 00:50:25,356
我有一身的本领
I have plenty of irons in the fire.

639
00:50:26,756 --> 00:50:28,726
如果你的抱负没有办法实现
Well, if your prospects don't work out,

640
00:50:28,786 --> 00:50:30,886
你可以去艾文泰大街上找一下
you can ask on any street in the Aventine

641
00:50:30,956 --> 00:50:32,925
易拉斯泰斯·福曼
for Erastes Fulman.

642
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:36,225
我这有适合你的工作
I will always have a job for you.

643
00:50:37,225 --> 00:50:39,925
我是个士兵，不是杀手
I'm a soldier, not a murderer.

644
00:50:41,255 --> 00:50:45,124
在这个时代，这两种人，有区别么？
These days, Pullo, is there really any difference?

645
00:50:47,984 --> 00:50:49,984
这杯算我的
Have a drink on me.

646
00:50:50,124 --> 00:50:52,424
等你清醒了以后，可以来找我
When you've sobered up, come and see me.

647
00:50:52,593 --> 00:50:54,823
我们可以谈点生意
We'll talk a little business.

648
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:06,548

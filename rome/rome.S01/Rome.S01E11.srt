1
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:55,191
 快点，孩子们  就好了
 Hurry up, girls.  Nearly ready.

2
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,711
你戴的饰物太多了！
You have too much metal on you.

3
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:58,231
不算多
It's not so much.

4
00:02:58,271 --> 00:03:00,361
我是个地方长官，不是亚洲之王
I'm a magistrate, not King of Asia.

5
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:02,302
给你妹妹一个
Give one to your sister.

6
00:03:02,862 --> 00:03:05,452
给你妹妹一个！
Give one to your sister!

7
00:03:06,322 --> 00:03:08,622
可不可以别烦我了 记得把头沙戴上
Will you stop fussing and put that veil on, please?

8
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:10,192
我们没时间了
We're going to be late.

9
00:03:16,093 --> 00:03:17,953
大人，我向您致意
Patron, I kiss you.

10
00:03:17,963 --> 00:03:19,823
很荣幸，玛比尼奥，找我何事？
Mabinio, you honor me. What do you want?

11
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:21,164
我…
I um...

12
00:03:21,264 --> 00:03:23,594
那么，我就直说了
well, I'll go straight at it then.

13
00:03:23,624 --> 00:03:26,464
我的尿壶在过去的9天内都被打破了
My piss pots were all broken this past nine day.

14
00:03:26,524 --> 00:03:29,125
不知道是哪个军团的士兵们
 Oh?  Soldiers, naming no legions,

15
00:03:29,195 --> 00:03:32,365
认为把尿倒在老实的公民头上是件有趣的事情
thought it funny to tip them out over the heads of honest citizens.

16
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:36,425
现在，谁说就是士兵干的？
Now now, who's to say it were soldiers?

17
00:03:36,495 --> 00:03:39,096
有可能是角斗士装扮士兵干的
Might have been gladiators simulating.

18
00:03:39,146 --> 00:03:41,176
我看到他们的时候我能够认出士兵
I know soldiers when I see 'em

19
00:03:41,196 --> 00:03:42,866
不是我有偏见
not as I'm prejudiced.

20
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:45,226
大部分士兵是好人，像你一样
Most soldiers are good men like yourself.

21
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:47,667
但是现在有许多外界因素…
But there's a lot of a foreign element these days

22
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,327
 这样的事情不会再发生了  我希望不会再发生了
 It won't happen again.  I should hope not.

23
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,997
罗马公民需要并且应该被尊敬
Roman citizens that need and deserve respect

24
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,397
但却被人用尿淋个净湿
are getting drenched in piss instead!

25
00:03:55,457 --> 00:03:56,998
而且一滴尿都没给我剩下
There's not a drop left!

26
00:03:57,068 --> 00:04:00,028
没有尿我怎么处理衣服？（尿液曾作为漂白剂）
How am I to make cloth without piss?

27
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:03,858
 我怎么… 这样的事情不会再发生了！
 How am I supposed to make   It won't happen again.

28
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:07,829
谢谢，大人
Thank you, Patron.

29
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,509
智慧神保佑您
Minerva keep you.

30
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:13,759
马思绪亚斯兄弟
Brother Mascius.

31
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:16,100
乌瑞纳斯兄弟
Ah, BrotherVorenus.

32
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,460
现在是个大人物了，嗯？
Big man now, eh?

33
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,200
你也不是什么小人物
You're not so small.

34
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,760
这些罗马婊子们
Ah... these Roman bitches.

35
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,931
自从我到这里后我就是干了后吃，吃了后再干
I've done nothing but fuck and eat and fuck since I got here.

36
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:28,531
兄弟，现在我们可不是普通大兵了
We're not under goatskin now, brother.

37
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,451
并无冒犯你女人之意
No disrespect to your women, huh?

38
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:34,792
我很想跟你再多谈谈 马思绪亚斯
I am pleased to speak with you more, Mascius,

39
00:04:34,822 --> 00:04:36,962
但是我要先见我的客人
but I must see to my clients first.

40
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:40,492
否则的话他们会因为你插队而有意见的
And they are upset if not received in their proper order.

41
00:04:40,522 --> 00:04:42,863
当然应该是这样
Of course, of course.

42
00:04:42,893 --> 00:04:47,163
请原谅我这个当兵的粗鲁的行为
Excuse my crude soldier's ways.

43
00:04:57,674 --> 00:05:00,465
什么风把你吹来了，马思绪亚斯？
What brings you here, Mascius?

44
00:05:00,535 --> 00:05:02,195
只是来看看你怎么样了…
Oh, just seeing how you do...

45
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:04,665
看起来还不错啊
which is good, looks like.

46
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:06,695
我们的泰特斯·波罗在哪里？？
But where's that old Titus Pullo?

47
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,295
我不知道，有段时间没见他了
I don't know. I haven't seen him.

48
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:09,766
少来了！
Gerrae!

49
00:05:09,836 --> 00:05:11,966
你跟波罗形影不离的啊
You and Pullo were like Castor and Pollux.

50
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:13,666
我已经不关心波罗的死活了
Pullo's dead to me.

51
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:20,027
很高兴你过得还不错
Well, I'm glad to see you're doing so good.

52
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:31,518
 我们的老长官怎么样了？ 他还不错
 How's our old chief then, eh?  He is well.

53
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:33,568
很好，很好
Good good.

54
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,499
说实话
I'll not lie,

55
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:39,569
弟兄们很不高兴，非常不高兴
your brothers are unhappy, very unhappy.

56
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:42,029
他们感觉老长官忘记他们的拥立之功
They feel the old chief's forgot who brung him here.

57
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:45,159
不能再发钱了，说好了的
They cannot have more coin. There is an agreement.

58
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:47,030
没错，没错
Ay, there is. There is.

59
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,170
钱是够多了
And it's adequate coin.

60
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,460
我在钱上还看到他的头像
Got his picture on it now I see.

61
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,470
铸钱的想用谁的头像是他们的事
A coiner may depict what he likes.

62
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,151
问题是，兄弟们需要的不仅仅是钱
Fact is, our brothers need more than just money

63
00:05:57,161 --> 00:06:00,201
如果他们想要过上好日子
if they're to lead honorable and peaceful lives.

64
00:06:00,241 --> 00:06:02,571
有一天钱用光了，那他们怎么办？
Money runs out one day, then what do they do?

65
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:03,872
怎么办？
What?

66
00:06:03,932 --> 00:06:06,172
他们或许要去做生意？
They need to take up a trade maybe?

67
00:06:06,192 --> 00:06:08,522
我看不太可能。他们还能做什么？
It's unlikely. What are they to do?

68
00:06:08,532 --> 00:06:12,072
别跟我绕圈子，兄弟 有话直说
Do not pose questions at me, brother. Speak directly.

69
00:06:12,232 --> 00:06:14,503
我们想要意大利的田地
We want land in ltaly.

70
00:06:14,523 --> 00:06:17,533
只要恺撒能够做到，他就会给兄弟们土地的
Caesar will give all veterans land when he can

71
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,563
正如他承诺的一样，但是不是在意大利
as he promised he would, but not in ltaly.

72
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:21,963
恺撒给你的田地在意大利
Caesar gave you land in ltaly.

73
00:06:21,973 --> 00:06:24,304
我是个地方长官，需要收入
I am a magistrate, and he must have an income.

74
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:27,064
而且我是一个人，而不是几个军团
But I am one man, not legions.

75
00:06:27,134 --> 00:06:29,504
肯定很不错
Must be lovely.

76
00:06:30,304 --> 00:06:32,705
我还没有看过我的地呢，太忙了
I haven't seen it yet. I'm too busy.

77
00:06:32,765 --> 00:06:35,805
当然了…很忙，很忙
Of course. Busy busy.

78
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:41,006
 我们不想无理取闹… 那就别这样
 We don't want to be unreasonable   Then don't be.

79
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:43,466
我们有过约定的
We have an agreement.

80
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:50,037
我会跟弟兄们商量的
Talk it over with your man.

81
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:52,367
 战神保佑你  也保佑你
 Mars and Bellona keep you.  And you.

82
00:07:58,034 --> 00:07:59,774
头，小心点
Cavi, Chief.

83
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:01,904
你好，波罗
Salve, Pullo.

84
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:05,735
怎么样？
How goes it?

85
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,805
来点睡鼠肉？
Want some mouse?

86
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,076
你应该尝点，这里的睡鼠肉很美味
You should. They do 'em savory here.

87
00:08:12,136 --> 00:08:13,836
城里最好的睡鼠肉
Best mouse in the city.

88
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:17,676
那么…有什么工作给我吗？
So... do you have some work for me?

89
00:08:17,736 --> 00:08:20,006
总有要买命的人
Always somebody needs mortality.

90
00:08:20,076 --> 00:08:21,537
给我个名字
Give me a name.

91
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:24,767
问题是你需要谨慎
Trouble is, my honey, you want discretion.

92
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,407
你上次做的那单活
This last job?

93
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:28,807
你在艾文泰追那个人追得鸡飞狗走…
You ran that poor scurra up and down the Aventine

94
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:31,238
就像治安官抓小鸡
Iike Justice chasing chickens.

95
00:08:31,508 --> 00:08:33,628
还不如到市场去这么做
Might as well have done it in the Forum.

96
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,878
 我下次会干得无声无息的  我可不知道你会怎样
 I'll go quiet next time.  I don't know.

97
00:08:35,938 --> 00:08:37,908
我要为我的名声着想
I've my reputation to think of.

98
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:40,369
来找我买命的人
People come to me for their mortality work

99
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:41,869
知道我的手下都是很可靠的
 because they know my men are reliable.  That's right.

100
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,939
没错，可靠的人
Reliable men.

101
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,439
下次我会安安静静的完成任务的
I'll be quiet as death next time.

102
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,640
明天这个时候过来
Come back tomorrow, same time.

103
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,910
乌宝会带你去认人的
Urbo will take you to your man.

104
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,271
先给我点酬金
Give me some money on spec.

105
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:12,812
不能在这里
Not here.

106
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:18,973
这里是招呼正经公民的端庄的地方
This is a respectable place for decent citizens.

107
00:09:21,003 --> 00:09:22,703
他们想要我怎么做？
What would they have me do?

108
00:09:22,773 --> 00:09:25,004
我又不能变出土地
I cannot make farmland.

109
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:27,644
是的，你可以这称之为驱逐
Certainly you can. It's called eviction.

110
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:29,744
 我应该驱逐谁？ 你的敌人
 And who shall I evict?  Your enemies.

111
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:31,174
敌人？我有敌人吗？
 Enemies? I have enemies still?  Strange to say.

112
00:09:31,174 --> 00:09:33,175
很奇怪你这么说

113
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,875
他们都已经变成朋友了
I shall make friends of them in time.

114
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:37,265
那么你手下的老兵就会成为敌人…
And make enemies of your veterans... unless something is done.

115
00:09:37,265 --> 00:09:38,675
除非你做点什么

116
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:41,205
他们会不会转头反对我？
Is it possible they turn on me?

117
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:43,676
他们肯定不会起兵反对你…
They would never fight against you,

118
00:09:43,746 --> 00:09:45,676
如果他们不满意
but if they're not satisfied

119
00:09:45,746 --> 00:09:48,106
他们就会成为强盗…
they will turn to banditry and raiding.

120
00:09:48,176 --> 00:09:50,576
打着你的名义…可不怎么好
In your name. Not good.

121
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:54,207
跟马思绪亚斯说
Tell Mascius

122
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,147
我尊重他的坦诚
I respect his honesty.

123
00:09:57,207 --> 00:10:00,878
跟他说，那些老兵对我来说就像孩子一样
Tell him my veterans are as sons to me,

124
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:05,038
对于他们的忠诚，我打算给他们…
and to all loyal veterans I shall give good lands in...

125
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:09,579
波兰尼亚的土地肥沃美好的滩地
Pannonia. Good fertile bottomlands.

126
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:13,179
 波兰尼亚？ 有什么想说的
 Pannonia?  Speak freely.

127
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,799
那是个苦地方，而且很远
It's hard country, Pannonia, and far away.

128
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:18,780
马思绪亚斯不会接受的
Mascius will refuse it.

129
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,380
马思绪亚斯拥有老兵的信任吗？
Does Mascius have the men's full trust?

130
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,380
他能说服他们吗？
Can he sway them either way?

131
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,250
马思绪亚斯能说服第10军团的人，第10军团的人
He can sway the 10th men, and what the 10th men do will sway other legions.

132
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,831
会说服其它军团的人

133
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:30,581
那么给他个人点好处
Make him a personal offer then.

134
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:34,151
 给多少？ 你自己拿主意吧
 To what limit?  You be judge of that.

135
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:38,712
地方长官乌瑞纳斯…
Oh, Magistrate vorenus...

136
00:10:38,782 --> 00:10:41,882
我侄女在下个集市日会开一个酒会
my niece is holding a symposium next market day

137
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:45,342
我希望你跟你的夫人能够成为我的客人
and I should like you and your wife to come as my guests.

138
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:46,973
我们的荣幸，长官
We are honored, sir.

139
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:48,843
你有问题？
You look troubled.

140
00:10:49,613 --> 00:10:53,243
我跟我老婆都不太会跟人打交道
My wife and l are simple people, sir.

141
00:10:53,313 --> 00:10:56,644
没关系，你应该适应上流社会
No matter. You shall get used to good society.

142
00:11:15,646 --> 00:11:17,376
感觉如何？
How is it?

143
00:11:17,446 --> 00:11:20,516
舒服多了
Much more comfortable.

144
00:11:20,576 --> 00:11:24,477
我不认为我能够再背负西赛罗的称颂了
I don't think my back could take another of Cicero's eulogies.

145
00:11:24,547 --> 00:11:27,577
他把你歌颂得无以伦比
No, he praises you so long and high,

146
00:11:27,847 --> 00:11:30,677
人们可能都会认为他是发自内心的呢
one might think he was being sincere.

147
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:37,978
 您好，大人  你好，公民
 Salve, Magistrate.  Salve, citizen.

148
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:42,509
我丈夫回来了
My husband is home.

149
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:44,479
你们来看我真是太好了
It was so good of you to visit.

150
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:47,679
我相信你太客气了
Oh. Not at all, I'm sure.

151
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,010
下次再来，我很高兴接见你们
Please come again. I'd be so happy to receive you.

152
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,310
谢谢
Thank you.

153
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:02,111
别吹了
Desist that now.

154
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:06,051
她说…接见我们
Receive us, she says.

155
00:12:06,111 --> 00:12:08,382
 我… 女士们
 I would   Ladies.

156
00:12:08,452 --> 00:12:11,152
地方长官大人
Magistrate, sir.

157
00:12:15,112 --> 00:12:17,513
 丈夫… 这些是…？
 Husband...  What are these now?

158
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,143
租来的，价格很合适
Leased, and at very good rates too.

159
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:21,783
他们看起来不好吗？
And don't they look impressive?

160
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:24,283
给他们多穿点衣服
Put some more cloth on 'em.

161
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,484
你看起来很累
You look tired.

162
00:12:26,544 --> 00:12:28,244
为什么不躺会儿？
Why don't you lie down?

163
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,854
我到希望我能够躺会儿
I wish I could.

164
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:37,045
“依照元老以及人民的要求
"By claim of the Senate and people,

165
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:41,145
我们深爱的长辈盖乌斯·优利乌斯·恺撒
our beloved Father, Gaius Julius Caesar,

166
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:44,786
已经被尊为终身独裁者
has been declared Dictator for life.

167
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:49,246
此外，每年的第五个月在此后
Furthermore, the fifth month is

168
00:12:49,316 --> 00:12:52,816
就将被称为”优利“以此来表示对他的敬意
henceforth name July in his honor."

169
00:12:59,217 --> 00:13:00,787
擦掉它
Erase that.

170
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:03,788
卡西亚斯
Cassius.

171
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:09,018
这么做是没用的，每座山丘，每面墙上都有这样的图画
It will do no good. The image is on every wall, on every hill.

172
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:11,048
别担心这些涂鸦
Don't worry about those scribbles.

173
00:13:11,118 --> 00:13:13,219
恺撒大帝知道你是他忠诚的朋友
King Caesar knows you're his loyal friend.

174
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,179
我对此倒不担心
Oh, I'm not worried about that.

175
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:18,049
只是我看起来真的是这样的吗？
No, it's just, do I truly look like that?

176
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:19,849
很像
It's near.

177
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,680
真是不幸
 Well, how tragic.  Hmm.

178
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,950
但是图画可表现不出你的活力
But an image cannot catch your vim,

179
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,920
你高贵的活力
your noble vitality.

180
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,780
我说的都是真的
I speak only what's true.

181
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,821
大家认为你有像你先祖一样的行为风范
You have that grace in action they say your noble ancestor had.

182
00:13:32,881 --> 00:13:34,721
这就是老百姓把你画到墙上的原因
That's why plebs put you on the walls.

183
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,751
 他们在你身上看到了你先祖的影子  他们只是看到我可怜的姓氏而已
 They see him in you.  They see my wretched name, that's all.

184
00:13:37,821 --> 00:13:40,752
笨蛋，让我们说点别的
Simpletons. Let us speak of something else.

185
00:13:40,782 --> 00:13:42,652
姓氏还是很有分量的，不是吗？
There's weight in names, isn't there?

186
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:46,882
你可以把猫叫成鱼，但是它还是不会游泳
You may call a cat a fish, but it will not swim.

187
00:13:49,283 --> 00:13:52,423
老百姓渴望自由，以你的名义，他们…
The plebs love liberty. In your name they

188
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:55,013
他们可不会为了自由而做什么
They would not pluck a hair for liberty.

189
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,083
他们喜欢看上位人之间的斗争
Plebs like to see their betters fight.

190
00:13:57,154 --> 00:13:59,654
看戏还要花钱，而且斗争中流的血都是真的
It's cheaper than theater and the blood is real.

191
00:13:59,724 --> 00:14:02,424
来，跟我来
Come, come here with me.

192
00:14:05,754 --> 00:14:07,205
你看
Look now. Look at that.

193
00:14:07,405 --> 00:14:08,985
看看那个

194
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:13,285
是把椅子，怎么了？
It is a chair. What of it?

195
00:14:13,355 --> 00:14:15,786
椅子？它是王座！
Chair? It's a throne!

196
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:19,986
我相信王座通常都装饰的很精美
I believe thrones are generally more decorative.

197
00:14:19,996 --> 00:14:22,816
这不过是把普普通通的椅子
That is decidedly plain and chairlike.

198
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:23,586
你瞎了吗？
 Are you blind?  Do not become hysterical.

199
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:24,817
别变得歇斯底里
Your mother said you were a coward. I begin to believe her.

200
00:14:24,837 --> 00:14:26,827
你母亲说你是个胆小鬼，我开始相信她了

201
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:28,587
我的母亲很不高兴
My mother is very unhappy.

202
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:32,077
原谅我，我刚才说的有点过火
Forgive me. I spoke in anger.

203
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:36,138
我既不胆小也不瞎
I am no coward, nor am I blind.

204
00:14:36,148 --> 00:14:38,588
我知道恺撒是什么
I know what Caesar is.

205
00:14:38,618 --> 00:14:39,818
我能看出来
I can see.

206
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:43,289
但是我立过誓做他的朋友…
But I have pledged myself his friend

207
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:45,039
不，我是他的朋友
no, I am his friend.

208
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:48,389
那么，为了友谊
So for friendship

209
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:50,249
你就要让共和国灭亡？
you would let the Republic die?

210
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,490
我只是个人
I am just a man.

211
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,520
共和存亡的命运
The life or death of the Republic

212
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,650
不掌握在我手中！
is not in my hands!

213
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,380
你恰恰错了
You are precisely wrong.

214
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,481
共和的命运在你手中
The Republic is in your hands.

215
00:15:05,521 --> 00:15:08,851
只有布鲁图斯去结束一个暴君的生命
The people will not accept a tyrant's death

216
00:15:08,851 --> 00:15:11,152
才会被人民接受
unless a Brutus holds the knife.

217
00:15:12,322 --> 00:15:14,692
你说的太过分了
Now you have gone too far.

218
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:18,052
他一定要死
He has to die.

219
00:15:18,322 --> 00:15:21,653
你了解他，你知道他不会接受被流放的
You know him. You know he'd never accept exile.

220
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:23,953
他一定要死
He has to die.

221
00:15:33,624 --> 00:15:35,084
等等，朋友
Wait, friend.

222
00:15:35,554 --> 00:15:36,754
等等！
Wait!

223
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,235
Shh.

224
00:15:53,026 --> 00:15:55,426
那个高卢屄感觉起来如何？
How's that Gaulish cunny then?

225
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,057
我猜肯定很湿滑吧
Greasy I bet.

226
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:01,457
除非我跟你说话，否则别废话
Don't talk unless I tell you.

227
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:08,628
来了，中间那个奥非的亚斯
There, in the middle. Aufidius.

228
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,390
凶手！凶手！
Murderer! Murderer!

229
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,260
凶手！
Murderer!

230
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,191
凶手！凶手！
Murderer! Murderer!

231
00:16:34,621 --> 00:16:36,511
凶手！凶手！
Murderer! Murderer!

232
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:38,391
他杀了奥非的亚斯！
He killed Aufidiu!

233
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:49,122
奥非的亚斯！他杀了奥非的亚斯！
Murderer! He killed Aufidiu!

234
00:16:53,163 --> 00:16:54,223
奥非的亚斯
Aufidiu. He killed Aufidiu! Murderer!

235
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:55,223
他杀了奥非的亚斯！

236
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,863
凶手！
Murderer! He killed Aufidiu!

237
00:16:56,923 --> 00:17:00,354
凶手！他杀了奥非的亚斯！

238
00:17:13,795 --> 00:17:15,535
凶手！凶手！

239
00:17:16,655 --> 00:17:18,156
波兰尼亚？
Pannonia?

240
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:20,926
波兰尼亚可在900里之外
Pannonia is 900 miles away.

241
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:22,496
应该是600里左右吧
More like 600.

242
00:17:22,506 --> 00:17:25,586
几乎在赫马尼亚那里甚至都不是罗马的一个省
In Germania practically. It's not even provinced.

243
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,127
他们说那里的土地又黑又肥
Soil's black and deep they say.

244
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:28,897
高大的森林满是野味
Tall forests, full of game.

245
00:17:28,957 --> 00:17:31,957
到处都是日耳曼跟达迅强盗谁都不认识谁
Full of Teuton raiders and Dacian bandits and who knows who?

246
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:34,357
我们的弟兄们不想再打仗了
Our brothers don't want any more fighting.

247
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:36,258
他们不会再打仗了
They won't have it.

248
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:37,788
如果我们的弟兄们能够接受波兰尼亚
If our brothers accept Pannonia,

249
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:40,738
恺撒会对你非常感激
Caesar will be extremely grateful to you.

250
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,728
 如何感激法？ 5,000便士
 How so?  5,000 denarii.

251
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:47,759
 我不明白你的意思  我想你明白的
 I don't understand you.  I think you do.

252
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:50,829
从流第一滴血开始，我就以真心来对待我们的兄弟
I have been true to my brothers since I first spilled blood.

253
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:53,729
你以为我现在会因为5,000便士而背叛他们？
You think I would betray them now for 5,000 denarii?

254
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,460
 那么就7千  也许2万还差不多
 Seven then.  It might be 20,000.

255
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,600
我不像某些人那么贪婪
I am not so greedy as some.

256
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,460
某些人指谁？
Not so greedy as who?

257
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,491
我只是说我的尊严不能卖得太便宜
I merely say that my honor is not for sale so cheap.

258
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:09,701
如果你也支持波兰尼亚，你就没有出卖我们得兄弟
In favoring Pannonia, you would not betray our brothers.

259
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:13,092
如果他们不要波兰尼亚的田地，他们就什么也得不到
If they will not have Pannonia, they will have nothing.

260
00:18:13,462 --> 00:18:15,862
 我们手中有刀剑，不会饿死的  如果是那样，你们一样会死的
 Men with swords never starve.  But they still die,

261
00:18:15,932 --> 00:18:17,662
而且是当头的先死
captains first.

262
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:27,963
 一万五  一万
 15.  10.

263
00:18:29,223 --> 00:18:30,924
一万二
12.

264
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,524
一万二
12.

265
00:18:46,265 --> 00:18:48,826
那么我就要远行了，兄弟
I'll be away then, brother.

266
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,896
很高兴跟你见面
Good to see you.

267
00:18:51,966 --> 00:18:54,296
我也是
And you.

268
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:00,827
 那个男人走了吗？ 走了
 Has that man gone?  He has.

269
00:19:06,828 --> 00:19:10,328
 没事吧？ 你真美
 Is this all right?  You look beautiful.

270
00:19:11,968 --> 00:19:14,268
我害怕地简直无法呼吸
I'm so scared I can hardly breathe.

271
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,699
没事的
It will be fine.

272
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:20,059
亲爱的侄女，我已经有太多的事情要关注了
My dear girl, I have enough to worry about.

273
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:22,089
我不会因为一些涂鸦而就感到不安
I will not be fearful of graffiti.

274
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:24,599
我要告诉你，那些涂鸦里面说的事情可不是无中生有
I'm telling you, the scribblers are not wrong.

275
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:26,700
布鲁图斯会背叛你的
Brutus will betray you.

276
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,930
你似乎非常肯定
You seem very sure.

277
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,900
他母亲会迫使他这么做的
His mother will compel him.

278
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,800
见不到你死她是不会善罢罢休的
She will not rest until you are dead.

279
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,831
我想赛维莉娅对我已经没有什么兴趣了吧
I well imagine poor Servilia is not very fond of me,

280
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:36,931
但是说到真的想我死
but really, wants me dead?

281
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:39,231
阿提娅，你是多心了
Atia, you're a dramatist.

282
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:41,731
好吧，我已经警告你了，我就不多说了
Well, I've warned you. I'll say no more.

283
00:19:43,302 --> 00:19:45,332
我已经警告他了
I've warned him.

284
00:19:46,802 --> 00:19:48,902
你的心思不在这里
You're far away.

285
00:19:50,132 --> 00:19:52,963
希望你想的是某个令人愉快的地方
Somewhere pleasant, I hope.

286
00:19:53,603 --> 00:19:57,333
 不过是一个人而已  我也是这么听说的
 It's all one.  So they tell me.

287
00:19:59,293 --> 00:20:01,304
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

288
00:20:02,504 --> 00:20:06,234
你妈妈是个狠心无情的人
Your mother is a vicious and heartless creature,

289
00:20:06,294 --> 00:20:08,804
但我发现我…
but I find I am

290
00:20:08,864 --> 00:20:12,065
已经不能没有她
wretched without her.

291
00:20:12,135 --> 00:20:13,865
我已经尽力去讨好她
I have done my best to sway her,

292
00:20:13,935 --> 00:20:18,365
但是她还是像躲麻风病人一样的躲着我
but still she shuns me like a leper.

293
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:20,836
甚至不跟我交谈
Refuses even to speak to me.

294
00:20:22,936 --> 00:20:24,996
你能不能替我跟她说说
Will you talk to her for me?

295
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:29,667
让她知道我已经变得多么令人同情
Let her know how pitiful I have become?

296
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,267
没这个必要
There's no need.

297
00:20:34,337 --> 00:20:37,067
她对你的高姿态不过是作戏
Her disdain for you is an act.

298
00:20:37,137 --> 00:20:40,028
她是完完全全的被你迷住了
She is entirely infatuated with you.

299
00:20:40,098 --> 00:20:42,638
这绝对是非常愚蠢的谎言！
That is a wicked, foolish lie!

300
00:20:42,698 --> 00:20:44,898
阿提娅，我能跟你说几句话吗…
Atia, you let me speak with you

301
00:20:44,968 --> 00:20:48,029
女儿，门边的那个女人是谁？
Daughter, that creature over there by the door, who is she?

302
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:50,339
衣着庸俗的那个美人？
The beauty in the vulgar dress?

303
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:52,739
她是跟着卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯来的
She's with Lucius vorenus.

304
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,269
我想是他妻子吧
His wife I expect.

305
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:56,940
真漂亮
It's so beautiful.

306
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,500
连天花板都被画装饰了起来
They've even painted the ceiling.

307
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,850
她身上那种浓郁的底层品味真是恰到好处
She has a wonderful tang of the street about her.

308
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,810
让我来介绍你
Let me introduce you.

309
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,121
 我们也许应该四处走走  不，我们应该在这里等着
 Maybe we should walk around.  No, we should wait.

310
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:08,891
 他们向我们走过来了  镇定 镇定
 They're coming towards us.  Calm calm.

311
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,091
地方行政官大人
Magistrate, my niece would like

312
00:21:10,591 --> 00:21:12,731
我的侄女想要见见你可爱的妻子
 to meet your lovely wife.  Honored.

313
00:21:12,781 --> 00:21:14,202
不胜荣幸

314
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:16,972
内奥比 阿提娅
Niobe, Atia.

315
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:20,172
像你这样严厉的人是如何赢得这种美女的芳心的？
How did a grim thing like you win such a flower?

316
00:21:20,232 --> 00:21:22,502
我遇到她的时候她还年幼无知
I found her when she was still young and foolish.

317
00:21:24,003 --> 00:21:26,173
在我跟她幸运的丈夫谈事情的时候
Perhaps you will entertain Niobe

318
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:28,353
也许你应该款待内奥比
while I speak with her fortunate husband?

319
00:21:28,403 --> 00:21:30,023
乐意之极
Delighted.

320
00:21:30,273 --> 00:21:35,244
现在跟我说说是谁做了这么惊世骇俗的衣服？
Now, tell me, who on Gaia's earth

321
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:36,704
 我做的  不会吧
 made this astonishing dress?  I did.

322
00:21:37,194 --> 00:21:38,764
是我做的
 You didn't.  I did.

323
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:42,195
那么…马思绪亚斯是怎么说的？
So... what does Mascius say?

324
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:45,505
一万二，他接受波兰尼亚
He will accept Pannonia for 12.

325
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:47,265
非常好
very good.

326
00:21:47,635 --> 00:21:50,486
我没想到他把自己卖得如此便宜
I did not think he would sell himself so cheap.

327
00:21:50,606 --> 00:21:54,036
我应该让你去代我谈判所有的收买跟贿赂
I must send you to negotiate all my corruptions.

328
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:55,766
长官，我并不希望如此
I would rather not, sir.

329
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:58,986
说笑而已
I spoke in jest.

330
00:21:59,366 --> 00:22:01,667
我明白
I understand.

331
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,997
这边请
Please.

332
00:22:05,937 --> 00:22:08,167
你腐蚀了一个人
You have corrupted one man

333
00:22:08,187 --> 00:22:11,758
但你却挽救了几千人变成盗贼的命运
and saved thousands from banditry.

334
00:22:11,908 --> 00:22:14,088
我经常希望我能够回到高卢
I often wish I were back in Gaul.

335
00:22:14,238 --> 00:22:16,548
一些简单轻松的战争的事务
There is something pleasingly simple about warfare.

336
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,169
 乌瑞纳斯… 地方长官乌瑞纳斯，如果你能够这么称呼的话
 vorenus   Magistrate vorenus, if you please.

337
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:22,209
我的孩子，他的地位现在高于你
He outranks you now, my boy.

338
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:25,469
很抱歉，地方长官乌瑞纳斯
Excuse me, Magistrate vorenus.

339
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:27,470
我听仆人传说
I hear rumor among the servants

340
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,310
泰特斯·波罗因为谋杀被关在地牢
that Titus Pullo is in the dungeons

341
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,670
正在等待审判
awaiting trial for murder. Is it true?

342
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,170
有这么回事吗？
It is.

343
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,110
是这样的

344
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,141
他被雇佣，成了一个刀手
He has been hiring himself out as a knifeman.

345
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:39,141
光天化日之下杀了一个人
He killed a man in broad daylight.

346
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:40,971
我们必须要帮帮他
We must do something for him.

347
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,931
我们不能帮他
We must do nothing.

348
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:44,531
不能？
 Nothing?  The man he killed

349
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,202
他杀的人叫奥非的亚斯·登特
was Aufidius Dento,

350
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:49,972
西莲制钉协会的首席代表
Deputy Chief of the Caelian Nailmaker's Association.

351
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:53,102
他是个很受欢迎的人，而且他畅所欲言的批评我的领导能力
Popular man, apparently, and a vocal critic of my leadership.

352
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:56,703
人们将会猜想是我下令弄死他的
People will suspect I ordered his death.

353
00:22:56,773 --> 00:23:00,003
我不能帮助波罗来授人以口实
I must not confirm those suspicions by helping Pullo.

354
00:23:00,073 --> 00:23:02,703
那么是你
And did you...

355
00:23:02,773 --> 00:23:04,344
下令弄死他的吗？
order his death?

356
00:23:04,404 --> 00:23:07,374
直到他死了我才知道他的存在
I did not know he existed until he didn't.

357
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:10,174
我根本不知道他为何被杀了
I have no notion why he was killed.

358
00:23:10,544 --> 00:23:13,145
像那样的公众人物应该会有很多原因
Public man like that, might be many reasons.

359
00:23:13,205 --> 00:23:15,545
我不能让人看起来像是我派出我的士兵们
I can't appear to be sending out my soldiers

360
00:23:15,605 --> 00:23:17,535
去杀掉任何反对我的人
to murder anyone who opposes me.

361
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,535
我这样会失去民众的支持的…
I would lose support of the plebeians...

362
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:20,975
或许乌瑞纳斯跟我可以…
Perhaps vorenus and l might be able to

363
00:23:20,985 --> 00:23:24,406
任何跟我有关联的人也不能帮他
...nor can anyone associated with me help him.

364
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,236
他有什么朋友吗？
Has he any friends?

365
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:28,526
能帮他找个律师替他辩护？
Who will help him find a lawyer to defend him?

366
00:23:28,546 --> 00:23:30,506
他是有罪的
He is guilty.

367
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:33,677
人们要看到公正的裁决
People must see justice done.

368
00:23:33,737 --> 00:23:35,807
士兵们必须了解他们不是凌驾于法律之上的
Soldiers have to learn they're not above law.

369
00:23:35,877 --> 00:23:38,407
我很抱歉，乌瑞纳斯我知道他就像你的兄弟一样
I'm sorry, vorenus. I know he is brother to you,

370
00:23:38,477 --> 00:23:40,438
但是我们没得选择
but there is no choice.

371
00:23:42,578 --> 00:23:44,878
都是真的
It's all true.

372
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,939
我想我们可以走了，除非你…
I think we can go now unless you

373
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:57,439
我们可以吗？这里非常好，只是…
Can we? This is very nice, but...

374
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:00,080
我了解
I know.

375
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:14,301
卡斯特
Castor... in the morning,

376
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:18,712
明早把泰门那个犹太人带来见我
bring Timon the Jew here.

377
00:24:22,342 --> 00:24:24,072
母亲，晚安
Good night, Mother.

378
00:24:24,142 --> 00:24:25,943
晚安，宝贝
Good night, my love.

379
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:25,489
我看不出来有什么问题啊
I don't see what's wrong with it.

380
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,905
Oh, Moses, you need law?

381
00:26:22,245 --> 00:26:24,586
头号律师在这，在这！
Number one justice right here! Right here!

382
00:26:24,646 --> 00:26:27,116
找我吧，老板！顶级律师！顶级律师！
Take me, boss! Top lawyer! Top lawyer!

383
00:26:27,376 --> 00:26:29,386
 你水平不错吧，啊？ 不错？
 You're good are you?  Good?

384
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:31,176
我甚至能够替美狄亚洗脱罪名
I could have Medea acquitted. What's your case?

385
00:26:31,176 --> 00:26:33,057
你的是哪个案子？

386
00:26:33,147 --> 00:26:36,317
一个叫泰特斯·波罗的男人…
Man, name of Titus Pullo...

387
00:26:36,377 --> 00:26:39,277
 继续找吧，犹太佬  你不想接这个案子？
 On your way, Jew.  You don't want the case?

388
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,218
我宁愿去替冥神吹箫！
I'd rather suck Pluto's thorny cock.

389
00:26:44,778 --> 00:26:46,588
有人吗？
Anyone?

390
00:26:48,348 --> 00:26:51,219
有人想要工作吗？
Anyone want work?

391
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:57,319
有人吗？
Anyone?

392
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:14,541
如果你说出谁雇佣了你，
It would go much easier for you

393
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,261
事情对你来说会简单很多
if you said who it was that paid you.

394
00:27:16,451 --> 00:27:18,382
它能显示出你的悔罪
It it shows penitence.

395
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:20,112
对不起，帮不了你
I can't help you. Sorry.

396
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,852
我答应过不说的
I gave my word.

397
00:27:23,912 --> 00:27:26,382
或者你急需钱来救助你生病的母亲？
Perhaps you need the money to help your sick mother

398
00:27:26,452 --> 00:27:28,683
或者是有需要的朋友？
or a friend in need?

399
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:31,113
像这样事情将会对你有帮助的
Something like that would help.

400
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:33,083
我需要钱来买酒
I needed money for wine.

401
00:27:37,754 --> 00:27:40,804
你有没有什么朋友的会为你辩解的？
Have  have you any friends that would speak for you?

402
00:27:44,314 --> 00:27:46,845
肯定应该有的！
There must be someone.

403
00:27:48,615 --> 00:27:51,255
这个面包不错，还有吗？
Good bread, this. Have you got any more?

404
00:28:03,186 --> 00:28:07,487
泰特斯·波罗高卢13军团
Titus Pullo, soldier, 13th Gallic Legion;

405
00:28:07,547 --> 00:28:09,987
被控凶杀
Accused ofhomicide

406
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:13,218
公民奥非的亚斯·登特
re citizen Aufidius Dento,

407
00:28:13,288 --> 00:28:15,988
西莲山，佛伦那部族
Caelian Hill, tribe of Falerna;

408
00:28:16,048 --> 00:28:19,248
他的朋友代他出席审判
Brought to trial by his friends.

409
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:24,419
让我们开始
We begin.

410
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:29,619
谁代表死者奥非的亚斯·登特？
Who speaks for the corpse of Aufidius Dento?

411
00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:34,120
我…麦而斯·尼曲迪而斯
I... Maius Nigidius.

412
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:40,351
谁代表泰特斯·波罗？
Who speaks for Titus Pullo?

413
00:28:40,521 --> 00:28:43,381
我 我…
I l

414
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:46,851
普瑞瑟斯 麦乌厄斯
Priscus Maevius.

415
00:28:47,751 --> 00:28:50,452
原告，继续
Accusator, proceed.

416
00:28:51,452 --> 00:28:53,652
公民们
Citizens,

417
00:28:53,722 --> 00:28:55,452
朋友们…
friends...

418
00:28:55,522 --> 00:28:58,483
当我被告知奥非的亚斯死讯的时候
when I was told of the death of Aufidiu,

419
00:28:58,553 --> 00:29:00,823
我极度悲伤
I was deeply saddened.

420
00:29:00,883 --> 00:29:04,223
一个好人被捅死，被屠杀！
A good man, stabbed! Butchered!

421
00:29:04,283 --> 00:29:08,054
在大街上，光天化日之下被砍死！
Hacked to death in daylight on a public street!

422
00:29:10,754 --> 00:29:12,654
我极度地悲伤
I was deeply saddened.

423
00:29:12,724 --> 00:29:14,684
单是我并不惊讶
But I was not surprised.

424
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:18,685
这种惨剧已经变得很平常了
These horrors have become commonplace.

425
00:29:18,755 --> 00:29:21,755
这种悲惨的例子
Wretched specimens like this

426
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:24,155
如同老鼠一样多
are common as rats.

427
00:29:25,786 --> 00:29:28,756
我不会占用你们的时间，通过长篇的演说来验证他是有罪的
I will not take your time with lengthy proof of his guilt.

428
00:29:28,816 --> 00:29:30,386
看看他！
Look at him!

429
00:29:31,056 --> 00:29:34,516
问都不用问，我们都知道他有罪
It's not open to question. We all know he's guilty.

430
00:29:38,787 --> 00:29:41,617
当我在地窖里看到老鼠的时候
When I find a rat in my cellar,

431
00:29:41,687 --> 00:29:45,758
我不会问什么问题，我会让奴隶一脚踩死它
I don't ask questions, I have a slave squash him underfoot...

432
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:48,118
兄弟，你好
Salve, brother.

433
00:29:48,188 --> 00:29:49,588
也向你问好，兄弟
And to you, brother.

434
00:29:49,658 --> 00:29:51,218
不是太好，对吧？
Not good, eh?

435
00:29:51,228 --> 00:29:53,459
你在这里干吗？我以为波罗对你来说已经死了
What are you doing here? I thought Pullo was dead to you?

436
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:55,319
很快他就要真的死了
Dead to all soon.

437
00:29:55,389 --> 00:29:56,959
你还是像硬石一样顽固
Hard as adamant, you.

438
00:29:56,969 --> 00:29:58,619
但是，你可能是错的
Well, you might be wrong, though.

439
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:00,519
许多人即将面对刀锋跟祭坛
Many's the slip 'tween knife and altar.

440
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:03,220
 什么？ 波罗可不是孤单一人
 What?  Pullo is not alone.

441
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,191
我们可不会让任何一个兄弟被这帮卑贱的乌合之众伤害
We'll not let any brother be damned by this dirty mob.

442
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:14,391
这帮狗头不久就会更大声的呼叫了
These dogs will be yelping louder soon.

443
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,411
当他们把他带下来的时候
When they bring him down off there,

444
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:18,311
我们就杀进去把他救走
we'll go in swinging and have him away.

445
00:30:18,321 --> 00:30:20,622
 叫他们走！ 为什么？
 Call them off!  Eh? Why?

446
00:30:20,692 --> 00:30:23,292
难道你不知道这件事到底是关于什么的吗？
Do you not understand what is at stake here?

447
00:30:23,352 --> 00:30:25,292
 波罗兄弟的命  政治
 Brother Pullo's life.  Politically.

448
00:30:25,352 --> 00:30:27,152
是关于政治
What is at stake politically.

449
00:30:27,222 --> 00:30:30,793
政治，我操翻那个政治！
Politically. I fuck politically in her fat ass.

450
00:30:31,053 --> 00:30:33,223
如果波罗被恺撒的手下救了
If Pullo is rescued by Caesar's men,

451
00:30:33,253 --> 00:30:36,093
人们会以为是他下令弄死登特的
people will assume that he ordered Dento's killing

452
00:30:36,153 --> 00:30:38,123
恺撒就要为此负责
and Caesar will be held responsible.

453
00:30:38,153 --> 00:30:39,854
那又如何？恺撒能做任何他想做的事情
And so? Caesar can do as he likes.

454
00:30:39,924 --> 00:30:41,954
他正在努力重建法律跟秩序
He is trying to re establish law and order.

455
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:43,954
但如果他的士兵杀人而不用承担后果
That won't work if his soldiers are seen

456
00:30:43,964 --> 00:30:46,124
那么他就白忙了
to be killing citizens without consequence.

457
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,805
我现在还是不能让兄弟们走
Still. I can't call the boys off now.

458
00:30:47,815 --> 00:30:49,505
 为什么？ 因为这让我没面子
 Why not?  Because it makes me look bad.

459
00:30:49,525 --> 00:30:52,695
不这么做的话，你可能会更没面子
You could look far worse.

460
00:30:55,155 --> 00:30:56,926
你会告发我们？
You will tell them?

461
00:30:58,496 --> 00:31:01,156
如果需要，我会的
I will if I have to.

462
00:31:03,816 --> 00:31:05,536
看着我，兄弟
Look at us, brother.

463
00:31:06,757 --> 00:31:08,897
怎么会这样呢？
How has it come to this?

464
00:31:11,657 --> 00:31:14,057
都是为了共和
It is for the good of the Republic.

465
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:16,528
所要付出的代价…
It's a worthy cause then.

466
00:31:19,428 --> 00:31:20,928
快让他们走吧
Just call them off.

467
00:31:31,729 --> 00:31:34,390
更加令人感到羞辱的是
To add insult to injury, this soldier,

468
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,890
这个不知哪里来的士兵，禽兽，野蛮人
this brute, this barbarian from who knows where,

469
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,360
拒绝供认他的雇主！
refuses to name his paymaster!

470
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,061
恺撒！恺撒！
Caesar! Caesar!

471
00:31:43,131 --> 00:31:46,591
我们无法说出姓名来，公民们，我们不知道
We name no names, Citizen. We cannot know.

472
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:48,591
我们可以猜
We might guess.

473
00:31:48,661 --> 00:31:51,492
我们可以好好的猜猜
We might very well guess,

474
00:31:51,562 --> 00:31:53,492
但是我们不知道
but we cannot know.

475
00:31:53,562 --> 00:31:56,492
这让他的罪行更加严重
Which makes his crime even worse.

476
00:31:56,562 --> 00:31:59,592
有能够惩罚像这样的禽兽的刑罚吗？
Is there punishment enough for monsters such as this?

477
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:06,546
I think not. I think not.

478
00:32:07,763 --> 00:32:10,364
但可能这位有学问的朋友
But perhaps my learned friend

479
00:32:10,424 --> 00:32:12,794
能够告诉我们
can tell us otherwise.

480
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,524
普瑞瑟斯·麦乌厄斯发言
Priscus Maevius speaks.

481
00:32:19,825 --> 00:32:22,765
这 这个人…
This this man...

482
00:32:22,825 --> 00:32:26,225
不是别的而是一个无助的奴仆
is nothing but a helpless servant.

483
00:32:27,025 --> 00:32:28,776
一个工具
Atool, a puppet.

484
00:32:29,816 --> 00:32:31,296
一个傀儡

485
00:32:31,596 --> 00:32:33,386
我们应该感到同情
We should feel pity, not anger.

486
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:35,176
而不是愤怒

487
00:32:35,216 --> 00:32:37,057
怜悯他的…
Pity for his

488
00:32:37,127 --> 00:32:40,297
怜悯他的堕落
pity for his degradation.

489
00:32:40,307 --> 00:32:43,337
等等，你是否主张他无罪？
Wait. Do you claim him innocent?

490
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:46,258
不是，我只是要说…
No, I'm simply saying that

491
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:49,528
那么，如果你不否认他是有罪的，那我们就结束了
Well if you do not deny his guilt, then we're done with it.

492
00:32:49,538 --> 00:32:50,948
你是否否认他是有罪的？
 Do you deny his guilt?  No, I do not sir.

493
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:53,908
 不，我不否认，长官  很好

494
00:32:53,948 --> 00:32:55,899
泰特斯·波罗
very well. Titus Pullo

495
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:59,899
被判有罪，将在竞技场被处死刑
condemned to death in the arena.

496
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,851
你知道我一直把你当成我的儿子看待
You know that I have always looked on you as my son.

497
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:17,401
噢，天哪，一次那样的谈话
Oh dear, one of those conversations.

498
00:33:18,761 --> 00:33:20,821
好棋
Hmm, good move.

499
00:33:21,061 --> 00:33:24,392
我想要你帮个忙，就像父亲对儿子
I have a favor to ask of you, father to son.

500
00:33:25,232 --> 00:33:30,232
我需要一个人帮我接收那个白痴维拉瑞而斯管理的马其顿
I need someone to take over Macedonia from that idiot valerius.

501
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,503
我想指派你去
I would like to appoint you.

502
00:33:34,693 --> 00:33:35,823
我管理马其顿？
I govern Macedonia?

503
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,633
如果你接受的话
If you will accept.

504
00:33:37,863 --> 00:33:40,964
以三个复仇女神的名义 为什么你要我管理马其顿？
Why by three Furies would you want me to govern Macedonia?

505
00:33:40,994 --> 00:33:43,034
你是适合这个任务的人
You are the right man for the job.

506
00:33:43,194 --> 00:33:46,964
我还真想不出几个不适合那个任务的人
I can think of few men less right.

507
00:33:47,034 --> 00:33:50,195
布鲁图斯，你总是低估自己
Brutus, you've always underestimated yourself.

508
00:33:50,265 --> 00:33:53,435
如果你尝试的话你会成就很大的事业
You might achieve great things if you would but try.

509
00:33:54,425 --> 00:33:56,635
在马其顿？
In Macedonia?

510
00:33:57,525 --> 00:33:59,716
我不这么想
I think not.

511
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:06,196
我要你再考虑考虑
I would ask you to reconsider.

512
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:09,477
我需要一个我可以信任的人去
I need someone I can trust.

513
00:34:17,128 --> 00:34:20,068
 你想要我离开罗马？ 不是这么回事
 You need me out of Rome?  Not at all.

514
00:34:20,628 --> 00:34:22,598
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

515
00:34:24,628 --> 00:34:27,199
一个你可以信任的人？
Someone you can trust?

516
00:34:27,229 --> 00:34:29,179
难道我这么做错了吗？
Am I wrong to do so?

517
00:34:29,189 --> 00:34:32,379
 你心中有疑问，不是吗？ 我没有这么说
 You have doubts, do you?  I did not say that.

518
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:33,269
我请你，坦白说
Speak plain, I beg you.

519
00:34:33,329 --> 00:34:35,720
我有让你疑心的原因？
Have I given you reason for doubt?

520
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,930
既然你问了，如你所知的你有让我疑心的原因
Since you ask, you have as you well know.

521
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,860
你说的是几年前
You speak of years ago.

522
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:44,621
以前的背叛不意味着什么？
Old betrayals do not signify?

523
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:46,751
我没有背叛什么
I betrayed nothing.

524
00:34:47,471 --> 00:34:51,131
如果你告诉我你要进军罗马
Had you told me you were to march on Rome

525
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:54,012
并要求我的效忠
and asked me for my allegiance,

526
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:55,982
我肯定会那样做的
I would have given it.

527
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:58,352
我可能会认为你是疯狂的…
I would have judged you insane...

528
00:34:59,672 --> 00:35:01,982
但是我会献上我的忠诚
but I would have given you my allegiance

529
00:35:02,012 --> 00:35:03,373
因为我把你看成父亲
because I look on you as my father.

530
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:05,463
 布鲁图斯… 但是你没有要求
 Brutus   But you did not ask for my allegiance.

531
00:35:05,463 --> 00:35:07,663
我的效忠

532
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:11,263
你是在刀兵之后才要求我的效忠
You demanded it at swordpoint.

533
00:35:11,273 --> 00:35:12,564
我什么都没有背叛！
I betrayed nothing!

534
00:35:12,634 --> 00:35:14,934
原谅我，我说的有点过了
Forgive me, I spoke too hot.

535
00:35:14,964 --> 00:35:18,064
你从来没有背叛过我
You have never betrayed me.

536
00:35:18,134 --> 00:35:20,414
那么为什么你不信任我？
 So why do you not trust me now?  I trust you completely.

537
00:35:20,414 --> 00:35:21,635
我完全相信你
So much so that you would send me

538
00:35:21,665 --> 00:35:23,335
如此信任，以至于要我

539
00:35:23,405 --> 00:35:26,265
离开罗马去管理马其顿？
from Rome to govern Macedonia?

540
00:35:34,376 --> 00:35:35,606
那么…
Well, thank you.

541
00:35:35,806 --> 00:35:36,816
谢谢
I am honored, but I will not go.

542
00:35:36,816 --> 00:35:39,027
我很荣幸

543
00:35:39,327 --> 00:35:42,077
单是我不会去的

544
00:35:46,897 --> 00:35:51,198
我有合法权力可以坚持你去
It is in my legal power to insist that you do go.

545
00:35:53,198 --> 00:35:54,668
如同我父亲
As my father,

546
00:35:55,388 --> 00:35:57,999
如同我父亲，我把你看成…
as my father I looked on you

547
00:35:58,069 --> 00:35:59,999
就是一年作用，不会很长时间
For a year or so, no more.

548
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:02,019
知道城里稳定下令
Until the city is stable.

549
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:04,139
原谅我，我感觉不好
Forgive me. I feel unwell.

550
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:05,739
或许我们可以下次再下完这盘棋
Perhaps we can finish this game another time

551
00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:07,170
理智点！
Be reasonable!

552
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,440
每面墙上都画着你用匕首刺向我喉咙的画！
You're on every wall with a knife at my throat!

553
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,740
不理睬这个迹象将是很蠢的做法
I would be foolish to ignore it.

554
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,840
只有暴君
Only tyrants

555
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,401
才需要担心暴君杀手
need worry about tyrant killers.

556
00:36:18,471 --> 00:36:20,101
你又不是暴君
And you are no tyrant.

557
00:36:20,171 --> 00:36:23,001
你不是告诉过我无数次吗？
Haven't you told me so many times?

558
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:24,602
你可以走了
You may go.

559
00:36:53,735 --> 00:36:57,905
门神，大地女神跟冥神…
Janus, Gaia and Dis...

560
00:36:58,705 --> 00:37:00,936
我虔诚的祈求
I humbly beg

561
00:37:01,006 --> 00:37:03,736
你们能够接受这个虫子作为我给你们的祭礼
you accept this creature as my offering,

562
00:37:04,936 --> 00:37:07,406
如果它能够让你们满意的话…
and if it pleases you...

563
00:37:09,726 --> 00:37:12,907
我祈求你们保佑艾瑞纳长命百岁
I ask you to give Eirene long life.

564
00:37:15,237 --> 00:37:19,768
也请保佑我的朋友卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯跟他的家人
And same for my friend Lucius vorenus and his family,

565
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:21,908
如果我的请求不是太过分的话
if it's not too much.

566
00:37:27,508 --> 00:37:30,369
请让艾瑞纳知道
And letEirene know

567
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:33,169
我为我所做的感到抱歉
that I am sorry for what I did.

568
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:46,811
来吧，士兵，上来！
Come on, soldier, up!

569
00:38:54,978 --> 00:38:57,108
这个要小心点…
Cavi with this one...

570
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,229
是战士
soldier.

571
00:39:18,841 --> 00:39:20,611
来吧，懦夫！打吧！
Come on, coward! Fight!

572
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,981
站起来开打吧
Stand up and fight.

573
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:27,602
我不想打
I don't want to.

574
00:39:28,142 --> 00:39:29,712
这样可不合规矩
That's not how it works.

575
00:39:29,772 --> 00:39:31,782
你应该要反抗的
You're supposed to resist.

576
00:39:31,842 --> 00:39:34,642
我不会反抗的，如果我不想的话
Not if I don't want to.

577
00:39:34,712 --> 00:39:36,543
我只是想死，好吗？
I just want to die, all right?

578
00:39:36,613 --> 00:39:39,243
动手杀了我吧，一切都会结束了
So come ahead and kill me and be done with it.

579
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:40,813
少瞎掰了，动手吧！
Bollocks. Move!

580
00:39:41,573 --> 00:39:43,773
你有什么问题？你的尊严去哪儿了？
What's wrong with you? Where's your dignity?

581
00:39:43,843 --> 00:39:45,774
起身战斗吧！
Get up and fight!

582
00:39:50,184 --> 00:39:52,144
士兵！醒醒！
Hey, soldier. Wake up!

583
00:39:52,614 --> 00:39:55,635
为什么你不过来帮我吹箫呢？
Why don't you come here and suck my cock?

584
00:39:55,675 --> 00:39:57,605
听着，只需要你拿起剑
Look, just hold your sword.

585
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:58,935
站起来，拿着剑，就够了
Just stand up and hold it, that's all.

586
00:39:58,945 --> 00:40:00,975
你不需要跑或什么的
You don't have to run about or anything.

587
00:40:01,445 --> 00:40:04,046
你什么都不是，只是个懦夫而已
You're naught but a bloody mollie.

588
00:40:04,116 --> 00:40:08,276
你跟13军团什么都不是，只是懦夫而已
You and the whole 13th! Naught but bloody mollies.

589
00:40:08,346 --> 00:40:10,516
别扯到13军团
Don't talk of the 13th.

590
00:40:12,987 --> 00:40:15,387
我他妈的尿到你们13军团！
Oh, eh? I piss on the 13th!

591
00:40:15,817 --> 00:40:18,347
都是一群猪卵
Pig spawn, all of em.

592
00:40:22,848 --> 00:40:28,148
为什么你不跟你们13军团排队来为我吹箫？
Why don't you and the 13th all line up and suck my cock

593
00:41:18,414 --> 00:41:20,244
13军团！
13!

594
00:41:21,814 --> 00:41:24,414
13军团！
13!

595
00:41:26,185 --> 00:41:28,415
13军团！
13!

596
00:41:30,285 --> 00:41:32,115
13军团！
13!

597
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,458
Heya!

598
00:42:42,713 --> 00:42:45,183
13军团！
13!

599
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:46,000
13军团！
13!

600
00:44:57,688 --> 00:45:01,088
波罗！波罗！
Pullo! Pullo! Pullo...

601
00:45:10,759 --> 00:45:13,620
 到了秋天，他们就消失了  谁？
 In autumn, they disappear.  Who?

602
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,220
鳗鲡，他们都会消失
Eels, they all disappear.

603
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,590
 是那样吗？ 哪里？
 That so?  Where?

604
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:21,060
 什么哪里？ 那么，他们去哪里了呢？
 Where what?  Well, where do they go?

605
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,861
 那些鳗鲡？ 这就是我想问的
 The eels?  That's what I'm saying.

606
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:23,601
谁都不知道
Nobody knows. It's a mystery.

607
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:25,231
是个秘密

608
00:45:30,091 --> 00:45:32,822
我等你很久了
Was expecting you time ago.

609
00:45:34,292 --> 00:45:36,472
如果我们再次雇佣你
If we employ you again, next time,

610
00:45:36,602 --> 00:45:39,322
下次最好别用老兵
best not use veterans.

611
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:12,576
母亲？
Mother?

612
00:46:13,056 --> 00:46:16,657
我不再拥有恺撒的友谊了
I owe Caesar no more friendship.

613
00:46:16,727 --> 00:46:18,657
我必须尽我的责任
I must do my duty.

614
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:41,969
我必须要跟卡西亚斯谈谈
I'll speak to Cassius.

615
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,980
看看我们能做什么
See what can be done.

616
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:06,548

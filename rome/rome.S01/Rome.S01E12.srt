1
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,547
波罗！波罗！

2
00:02:39,747 --> 00:02:41,677
还真是不错，不过…
It's quite good,

3
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:43,948
他们在现实生活中可要英俊的多
but they are far more handsome in real life.

4
00:03:07,797 --> 00:03:10,298
你在干吗？
What are you doing?

5
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,089
对不起，阁下，对不起，阁下，我只是在画你的肖像
Sorry, sir. Sorry, sir. Just taking your likeness, sir.

6
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:15,030
画我的肖像？
Taking my likeness?

7
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,071
你什么意思？快说，你个贼头贼脑的家伙！
What do you mean? Speak, thief!

8
00:03:22,272 --> 00:03:25,364
阁下，艾文泰衣物染房行会
Sir, Aventine Cloth Dyers Association

9
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:27,104
雇我来
are paying me

10
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:28,835
画一幅你跟
to do a mural of you

11
00:03:28,905 --> 00:03:32,176
乌瑞纳斯战斗在竞技场的画像
and Lucius vorenus in the arena, sir.

12
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:35,637
你给我说清楚为什么会有人这么做？
Explain yourself. Why would anybody do that?

13
00:03:35,707 --> 00:03:37,638
为什么，阁下？
Why, sir?

14
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,439
你出名了，阁下
You're famous, sir.

15
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:42,440
到处都是你的画像
There's paintings of you all over.

16
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:46,081
但是那些都不如我画的像，阁下
Not good accurate ones like I'm gonna do, sir.

17
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:50,983
 出名了？ 没错
 Famous?  Certainly.

18
00:03:51,043 --> 00:03:53,444
 我？ 整个城市的人都为你疯狂
 Me?  The whole city loves you, sir.

19
00:03:54,544 --> 00:03:56,045
你跟乌瑞纳斯地方官
You and Magistrate vorenus

20
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:58,446
就是兄弟友爱互助的象征
are symbols of brotherly love and redemption.

21
00:03:58,716 --> 00:04:01,387
如果你现在在罗马城的话，我很难相信会有哪位女士
If you were in Rome today, I doubt there's a lady in the city

22
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:03,878
不会为伟大的泰特斯·波罗敞开她房间的门
wouldn't open her doors for the mighty Titus Pullo.

23
00:04:03,888 --> 00:04:05,258
可以放手了吗，阁下？
 Would you let me go, please, sir?  Hmm? Oh.

24
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,349
Hmm.

25
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:15,375
很好，没错吧？
Beautiful, hmm?

26
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:17,375
直到河边为止这些地都是我们的
We own all of it, as far as the river.

27
00:05:17,445 --> 00:05:19,416
真是太好了
Lovely.

28
00:05:19,426 --> 00:05:20,416
最好适应一下这里
Best get used to it. Caesar might well

29
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,017
恺撒可能会把我从城中驱逐
exile me from the city.

30
00:05:22,717 --> 00:05:24,548
就是因为你救了波罗？
 Just for saving Pullo?  We'll live off the land like peasants.

31
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,759
我们就要农夫一样种田为生

32
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:30,030
 他不会那么认真的  他可能会给予更严厉的惩罚
 He wouldn't be so mean.  He might do far worse.

33
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,151
 他会怎样？ 没什么
 Like what?  Nothing.

34
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,831
我开玩笑的
I'm joking.

35
00:05:46,076 --> 00:05:48,557
我不认为我们可以躺在毯子上
I don't suppose we can lay down a blanket.

36
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:49,517
我也不这么认为
I shouldn't think so.

37
00:05:50,238 --> 00:05:51,558
好吧，如果我们以后要再这么做的话
Well, if we ever do this again,

38
00:05:51,598 --> 00:05:53,529
我就不会穿上我最好的衣服了
I'm not wearing my best.

39
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:55,369
你们这些城里的女人，太娇贵了
Too soft, you city girls.

40
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:58,771
你住嘴，我已经躺在这了，对吧？
Hush you, I'm down here, aren't l?

41
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:02,052
在我冻死之前赶快上来
Get on with it before I die of cold.

42
00:06:04,653 --> 00:06:07,014
我们要这样待多久？
How long like this?

43
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:10,165
直到祭司摇铃为止
Um, till the priest rings his bell.

44
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:12,696
女神保佑我
Juno help me.

45
00:06:15,857 --> 00:06:18,378
 这里的土很不错  潮湿而已
 It's good earth, this.  It's wet earth.

46
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,389
又黑又肥，没有多少黏土
Dark, loamy, not much clay.

47
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:21,989
这样的土地上种什么长什么
You can grow anything in soil like this.

48
00:06:22,109 --> 00:06:23,670
我们应该把农舍修到哪里？
Where should we build the farmhouse?

49
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,271
靠近水跟树林的山脊那边
That ridge over there. Close to the water and wood,

50
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:29,312
占据山谷的有利地形
good command of the valley.

51
00:06:29,392 --> 00:06:31,313
如果有高卢人来打我们的话？
In case we get attacked by Gauls?

52
00:06:31,393 --> 00:06:33,434
这都是说不准的
You never know.

53
00:06:35,314 --> 00:06:37,235
这只是仪式，你应该假装…的
You're meant to be pretending.

54
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:39,276
我是在假装
I am.

55
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:41,317
你不是
You're not.

56
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,532
Shh shh.

57
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:17,230
到老爸这里来
Come to Papa.

58
00:07:21,552 --> 00:07:23,312
贱货
Bitch.

59
00:07:28,874 --> 00:07:30,835
你们的地怎么样？
Well, how was the farm?

60
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:34,196
克拉莉萨，等到你看到那片地的时候就知道它真是很好
Oh, Clarissa, wait till you see it. It's beautiful.

61
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:36,677
我肯定它很好
Oh, it's very fine, I'm sure.

62
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,278
怎么了？
What's wrong?

63
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,559
 你们永远猜不到  我们永远猜不到
 You'll never guess.  We'll never guess.

64
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:42,809
 波罗从医院里跑了出来  什么？
 Pullo ran away from the hospital.  What?

65
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:45,731
几个马车夫在阿匹恩附件发现了半死不活的他
Some carters found him lying half dead by the Appian.

66
00:07:45,811 --> 00:07:47,971
 他要他们带他到这里来  这儿？
 He asked to be brought here.  Here?

67
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,892
他就在里面
He's inside.

68
00:07:59,136 --> 00:08:01,536
掌管冥界的众神啊
Gods beneath us.

69
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:04,778
他根本就不应该站起来，更别说骑马了
He should not have been on his feet, never mind on a horse.

70
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:07,099
他所有的伤口都像鲜花一样绽开了
All his wounds have opened up, fresh as flowers.

71
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:09,349
 真是个可怜的蠢货  我给他上了莨菪
 Poor stupid thing.  I've given him

72
00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:11,910
来止痛，并且把他固定在床上了
henbane to dull the pain and immobilize him.

73
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,911
如果他真能挺过来
If by any chance he lives,

74
00:08:13,991 --> 00:08:15,992
最少十周天之内
he shouldn't move on any account

75
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:18,473
他是无论如何都不能动了
for at least 10 days and nights.

76
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:24,715
只要他一能够动我就把他送回乡下
I'll send him back to the country as soon as he is mobile.

77
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,236
就他目前这样，他不会再惹什么麻烦的
He won't cause any trouble, not like this.

78
00:08:27,316 --> 00:08:29,157
就像以前那样
Like old times.

79
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,890
波罗
Pullo.

80
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:41,691
波罗？
Pullo.

81
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,454
卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯，长官
Lucius vorenus, sir.

82
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:51,415
你在这里干吗？
What are you doing here?

83
00:08:51,575 --> 00:08:54,136
 我在哪里？ 罗马，在我家里
 Where am l?  Rome, in my house.

84
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:57,417
你应该在艾文那的医院的
You should be in the hospital at Avernum.

85
00:08:57,497 --> 00:09:00,658
那就错过了这些趣事了？为什么把我绑起来？
And miss all the fun? Why am I tied up--

86
00:09:00,698 --> 00:09:03,219
什么有趣的事情？
What fun is that?

87
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:06,191
我们出名了，对吧？英雄
We're famous, aren't we? Heroes.

88
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:08,872
歌曲，戏剧
Songs, plays,

89
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:11,392
还有画到墙上的画像，对吧？
pictures on walls, eh?

90
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:13,873
你个该死的大惊小怪的蠢货，那又如何？
Damn foolish fuss. What of it?

91
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,594
你的脑子转的不够快啊，对吧？
You are a slow one, aren't you?

92
00:09:16,674 --> 00:09:19,115
女人
Women.

93
00:09:19,155 --> 00:09:21,156
女人
Women.

94
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:25,358
没有什么比有名的人更加能够吸引她们的了
They like nothing better than a man with a big name.

95
00:09:25,438 --> 00:09:27,799
拜托，你现在还活着就已经够运气了
Please. You are lucky to be breathing.

96
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,239
即使你能够熬到伤势复原
Even if you survive your wounds, Caesar will probably

97
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:31,280
恺撒都可能会把你再扔回竞技场
throw you back in the arena, and me with you.

98
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,291
而且还要我去作陪

99
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:36,892
你认为他会这么做？
Do you think he'll do that?

100
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:39,013
把我们俩再扔回竞技场？
Throw us back in?

101
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:43,654
明天就知道了，我明天要被召见
I'll find out tomorrow. I've been summoned.

102
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:48,256
他还说“女人”呢
"Women," he says.

103
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:50,097
如果你现在要一个女人
If you took a woman now,

104
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:52,178
你就会像一个旧袋子一样四分五裂了
you'd come apart like an old sack.

105
00:10:03,112 --> 00:10:05,553
就像以前那样
Just like old times.

106
00:10:06,113 --> 00:10:07,953
我无所谓
I don't mind.

107
00:10:09,514 --> 00:10:11,995
能听到你父亲的笑声真是太好了
It's good to hear your father laughing for a change.

108
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:16,479
艾瑞纳
Eirene,

109
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,560
看到你真是太好了
it's good to see you.

110
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:28,934
很公平
Fair enough.

111
00:11:36,536 --> 00:11:40,018
如果你下不了手
If you can't do it,

112
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:41,458
也没问题
that's all right too.

113
00:11:41,538 --> 00:11:43,579
艾瑞纳！
Eirene,

114
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,780
 你在干吗？-没什么
 what are you doing?  Nothing. Nothing.

115
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,511
别骗我，你手里是什么？
Don't lie. What's that in your hand?

116
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:52,232
我们只是在聊天
We were just talking.

117
00:11:52,272 --> 00:11:54,993
 聊天？ 我也才知道
 Talking?  Catching up.

118
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:56,074
你个傻瓜！
You fool! What if you killed him? What then?

119
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:58,475
如果你杀了他，你怎么办？

120
00:11:58,475 --> 00:12:00,235
所有人都会知道是你做的
Everybody would know it was you.

121
00:12:00,996 --> 00:12:04,597
一个自由女人杀了她的前任主人，真是太好了！
A freedwoman who killed her old master- very nice!

122
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:06,838
然后你去哪里，嗯？
And where would you go, hmm?

123
00:12:06,878 --> 00:12:09,239
 然后你怎么办？ 她说的没错
 What would you do with yourself?  She has a point.

124
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:10,999
去睡觉
Go to bed. We'll say no more of this.

125
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:13,440
这件事到此为止

126
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:21,933
她看起来不错
She's looking well.

127
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:26,695
晚安，波罗
Good night, Pullo.

128
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,181
女神保佑你
Juno protect you.

129
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:45,272
别担心
Don't worry.

130
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:50,074
我不能让恺撒等我
I can't keep Caesar waiting.

131
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,760
艾瑞纳，你做完那个后去看看波罗敷的药
Eirene, when you finish that, check on Pullo's dressings

132
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,640
有必要的话就换
 and change them if need be.  Me?

133
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,001
我？
You.

134
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,332
对，你

135
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:13,413
再喂他点粥
And feed him some porridge.

136
00:13:25,497 --> 00:13:27,338
谢谢
Thank you.

137
00:13:40,593 --> 00:13:42,553
今天
As of this day,

138
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:44,234
二月初一
the Kalends of February,

139
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:46,915
我们敬爱的元老独裁者
our beloved father dictator...

140
00:13:46,955 --> 00:13:49,396
盖乌斯·优利乌斯·恺撒宣布
Gaius Julius Caesar has decreed

141
00:13:49,476 --> 00:13:51,917
共和国元老院
that 100 new men be raised

142
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:54,998
要新增100名元老
to the Senate of the Republic.

143
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,639
二月初三
The third day before Nones,

144
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:01,160
要举行一个公共宴会
a public banquet will be held

145
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,452
以祝贺这些元老
to celebrate those senators.

146
00:14:05,532 --> 00:14:08,853
奴隶跟自由人不许参加
Slaves and freedmen are not eligible.

147
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:12,575
任何再次扰乱秩序的人
Any repetition of recent disorders

148
00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:15,656
都将受到严厉的惩罚
will be punished with severity.

149
00:14:19,377 --> 00:14:23,098
我应该在这里改变河道，你看
I shall divert the river here, you see,

150
00:14:23,138 --> 00:14:25,579
挖条运河到梵蒂冈山
by digging a canal to the vatican hills.

151
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:28,540
高！你应该改变河道
Splendid. You shall divert the river.

152
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:31,342
高！我对其起的作用毫无疑问
Splendid and useful, I have no doubt.

153
00:14:31,342 --> 00:14:33,312
实际上，这样可以防止洪水
Indeed. It will prevent flooding

154
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:36,513
而且更容易到达武装集训场
and give easier access to the Fields of Mars.

155
00:14:36,553 --> 00:14:38,954
在这片再生的土地上，我应该
And on the reclaimed land I shall build

156
00:14:38,994 --> 00:14:41,875
为执政院再修些办公场所
new civic offices for the courts.

157
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:43,876
我还应该修
I shall also construct

158
00:14:43,956 --> 00:14:45,877
一座维纳斯的神殿
a temple to venus Birthgiver.

159
00:14:45,957 --> 00:14:47,878
又一个神殿…太好了
Another temple- excellent.

160
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,159
但是我们是否能够抽空谈谈
But if we might for the moment speak

161
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:53,960
这个…元老院…的扩大…？
of this expansion of the Senate?

162
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,001
我们可以
 We might.  Ah.

163
00:14:56,081 --> 00:14:58,001
高卢人跟凯尔特人，老男孩
Gauls and Celts, old boy.

164
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:01,493
长发的高卢人跟画成蓝脸的凯尔特人
Long-haired Gauls and blue-faced Celts.

165
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:04,254
你肯定是在开玩笑
You're joking, of course.

166
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:06,014
他不是在开玩笑
He is not joking.

167
00:15:06,094 --> 00:15:08,896
高卢人跟凯尔特人？进入元老院？
Gauls and Celts? In the Senate?

168
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:11,577
从那些为罗马效劳最长时间的部落
From the tribes that have served Rome longest,

169
00:15:11,617 --> 00:15:14,498
 选择他们那些高尚人中最优秀的  我很吃惊
 the best of their nobility.  I'm astonished.

170
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,458
很好
Good. Astonishment is my intent.

171
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,619
我就是想要你们吃惊

172
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:20,820
当前的大英雄来了
Ah, here comes the hero of the hour.

173
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,941
怎么了？没戴橡树叶的花圈？
What, no wreath of oak leaves?

174
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:30,554
那么，乌瑞纳斯，我现在应该怎么处理你？
Well now, vorenus, what am I to do with you?

175
00:15:30,954 --> 00:15:33,795
藐视我定制的秩序，你竟然敢干扰
Defying my express orders, you dared interfere

176
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:36,036
一个通过法律裁定的死刑…
in a legally sanctioned execution--

177
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:40,637
完全是不服从以及犯罪的行为
an act of gross criminality and disobedience.

178
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,919
我深表歉意，长官，我没有任何借口
I humbly apologize, sir. I have no excuse.

179
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,160
你让我进退两难
You present me with a dilemma.

180
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,562
按正常的来说，我应该把你们扔到塔尔皮亚岩石之下
By right, I could have you thrown off the Tarpeian rock.

181
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:56,533
但是民众，思想简单
But the people, simple souls that they are,

182
00:15:56,613 --> 00:16:00,215
已经把你跟波罗捧作英雄了
have made great heroes out of you and Pullo.

183
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,215
如果我要惩罚你的话
If I were to punish you,

184
00:16:02,255 --> 00:16:05,737
会让民众变得极其愤怒
the people would be made extremely angry.

185
00:16:05,777 --> 00:16:07,857
我不想让民众们愤怒
I do not wish to make the people angry,

186
00:16:07,937 --> 00:16:10,218
因此，我不能惩罚你
ergo, I cannot punish you.

187
00:16:10,298 --> 00:16:12,379
如果我不能惩罚你，我必须要奖励你
If I cannot punish you, I must reward you,

188
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:15,220
否则的话，我会让人感觉没有权威
else I shall seem weak.

189
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,061
现在，听听这个，西塞罗
Listen to this now, Cicero.

190
00:16:18,101 --> 00:16:20,382
基于公众强烈的呼声
By popular acclaim,

191
00:16:20,422 --> 00:16:22,833
我应该任命卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯
I shall name Lucius Vorenus

192
00:16:22,913 --> 00:16:24,994
成为罗马的一名元老
a Senator of Rome.

193
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:29,996
很好，对吧？
Good, eh?

194
00:16:32,036 --> 00:16:35,118
现在，你们全都非常吃惊
Now you're all astonished.

195
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:37,639
乌瑞纳斯，你看起来就像看到了蛇发怪女一样
vorenus, you look like you've seen the Gorgon.

196
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:39,399
对不起，长官…
Excuse me, sir,

197
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,760
我太吃惊了
I'm stunned.

198
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,720
你怎么想的？
What do you say?

199
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,361
你会在元老院为你的人民说话吗？
Will you speak for your people in the Senate?

200
00:16:46,362 --> 00:16:49,003
如果能这么做，我万分荣幸，但你真的认为我配当元老吗
I'd be honored to do so, if you think me worthy.

201
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,014
没有比你更相称的
There's none worthier.

202
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:54,215
你应该会成为一个杰出的元老
You shall make an excellent senator.

203
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:57,526
真是令人感动
very touching.

204
00:16:57,566 --> 00:17:00,287
最开始的几个礼拜你要跟在我的身边
For the first few weeks, you will stay close by me.

205
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,088
学习那些规矩
 Learn the drill.  Thank you, sir.

206
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:04,009
谢谢你，长官
Forgive me,

207
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:06,049
请原谅我，但是说真的，我必须作为一个朋友…
 but really I must, as a friend--

208
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:08,730
我必须要抗议！
I must protest!

209
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,492
一个低贱的平民进入元老院？
A lowly pleb in the Senate?

210
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,452
这有点太过分了！
That's going too far.

211
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,413
并无冒犯你的意思，乌瑞纳斯
No offense to you, vorenus.

212
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:19,784
我不想再搞什么竞技场的东西了，西赛罗
I do not wish to jump in any arenas, Cicero.

213
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:22,105
我必须用别的方式来取悦民众
I must please the people in some other fashion.

214
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:24,386
再修一座神殿或者杀掉某个人
Build yet another temple. Kill someone.

215
00:17:24,426 --> 00:17:26,747
人们很容易就会满足的
The people are easy to please.

216
00:17:26,787 --> 00:17:27,867
但不是这个！
 Not this.  I wish the Senate

217
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:30,669
我希望元老院里面是整个意大利最优秀的人
to be made of the best men in ltaly,

218
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,390
而不仅仅是罗马里这些有钱的老面孔
not just the richest old men in Rome.

219
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,710
一个非常有意思的想法
An intriguing notion.

220
00:17:58,209 --> 00:17:59,849
你会让许多人非常生气
You'll make a lot of men very angry

221
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:01,850
都因为你提拔的那些高卢人，凯尔特人
with your Gauls and your Celts

222
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,891
那些平民等等
and your plebs and such.

223
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,372
我要加倍你的护卫队
I'll have to double your guard.

224
00:18:06,412 --> 00:18:08,453
我已经跟他说过了，他会听吗？
That's what I told him. Will he listen?

225
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:10,253
护卫能够让我的敌人远离
Guards can keep my enemies away. They can do nothing

226
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:12,134
这样的话，他们就不能对我的朋友们做什么了
 about my friends.  You don't mean me, do you?

227
00:18:12,984 --> 00:18:14,625
你不会是指我吧？
I can assure you, I have no ill intentions.

228
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,666
我可以向你保证，我可没有什么不良企图

229
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:19,667
我知道
I know.

230
00:18:19,747 --> 00:18:21,667
并不是你没有
Not that you were not perfectly capable

231
00:18:21,748 --> 00:18:23,828
 作恶的能力  谢谢
 of any manner of wickedness.  Thank you.

232
00:18:23,908 --> 00:18:26,949
而是如果你要背叛我 你在很久之前就应该已经做了
But if you were going to betray me, you would have done it long ago.

233
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:29,670
别以为我没有考虑过
Don't think I wasn't tempted.

234
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:32,311
那么，不增加护卫 你只能指望你的运气了
So, no more guards then. You will trust Fortune.

235
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:34,992
 很好，很虔诚  别嘟嘟囔囔了
 very good. very pious.  Stop your grizzling,

236
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,373
你这个老女人
you old woman.

237
00:18:36,392 --> 00:18:38,458
谁敢动我一根手指头？
Who will dare raise a hand to me

238
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:39,794
有勇猛的卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯在我身边
with the ferocious Lucius vorenus at my side?

239
00:18:44,806 --> 00:18:46,727
聪明
Ah. Clever.

240
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:49,848
跟我了这么多年你居然还是
All these years together, and it still surprises you

241
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,128
为我的能力感到吃惊
I can tie my sandals.

242
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:55,650
好好睡，小男人
Sleep sound, little man.

243
00:19:08,665 --> 00:19:10,586
你母亲跟我一直在想
Your mother and l have been thinking

244
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,947
要给你找个丈夫
about finding you that husband.

245
00:19:15,027 --> 00:19:16,988
一个元老的女儿不能
Asenator'sdaughter

246
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:19,269
老过着单身的生活
cannot be running around unattached.

247
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:21,030
不着急
Oh, there's no hurry.

248
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,111
别担心，我们会给你找到个有钱的老头子的
Don't worry, we'll find you a good rich old man

249
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:26,192
你只需要转动你的小手指
you can wrap around your little finger.

250
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,152
像你这种出色相貌的可有不少选择
Beauty like you can have your pick.

251
00:19:28,232 --> 00:19:30,673
我跟你说过我不想嫁一个有钱的老头
I told you, I don't want a rich old man.

252
00:19:30,713 --> 00:19:32,654
你当然想要 你想想看
Of course you do. Just think of all those

253
00:19:32,694 --> 00:19:36,685
你能拥有的那些好衣服，珠宝跟奴隶
fine dresses and jewels and slaves you'll have.

254
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:38,926
我可不在乎这些不重要的东西
I don't care about such trivial things.

255
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:40,607
不重要？
Trivial?

256
00:19:41,527 --> 00:19:43,448
我像你这么大的时候
When I was your age,

257
00:19:43,528 --> 00:19:45,929
我只能啃沟里捡来的骨头
I had to eat bones from the gutter.

258
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:48,090
衣服跟珠宝可是非常重要的
Dresses and jewels are not trivial.

259
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,170
这些东西显示了你们
They show others that your people

260
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,651
有钱有权，而且
are rich and powerful and that you are

261
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,973
你受到了尊重，爱与保护
Ioved and protected and valued.

262
00:19:56,053 --> 00:19:58,654
但我想嫁一个我爱的人
But I want to marry someone I love.

263
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:03,425
感情不是天生的，是需要培养的
Love doesn't come unbidden, you have to work for her.

264
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:05,946
如果你一开始就爱着那个男人，那你的婚姻才真是怪异的
Strange marriage it would be if you loved him from the start.

265
00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:07,467
没错，需要点时间
That's right. It takes a while. Now you be a good

266
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:11,468
你成为了一个贞洁的好妻子，那么你就能赢得爱
virtuous wife, and love will come.

267
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:15,150
你母亲跟我我们过去有过问题，对吧？
Your mother and l, we had our troubles, didn't we?

268
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,790
看看我们现在
 Look at us now.  Happy as you like.

269
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,791
非常快乐
I suppose.

270
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:20,312
我想是吧
So...

271
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,352
那么…
a good rich old man it is then.

272
00:20:22,913 --> 00:20:25,434
说好了，一个有钱的老好男人
Hmm?

273
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:48,212
我正打算叫醒你
I was about to wake you.

274
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:51,133
不论你梦见了什么，肯定都不是一个好梦
Wherever you were, you were not enjoying yourself.

275
00:20:52,494 --> 00:20:54,454
又一个有征兆的梦
It was another dream of omens.

276
00:20:54,494 --> 00:20:57,385
你都快成神使了
You're becoming quite the oracle.

277
00:20:58,066 --> 00:20:59,986
要我叫人拿点水吗？
Shall I send for some willow water?

278
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:02,707
 你能睡得舒服点的  我梦见自己在乡村中
 You'll sleep better.  I was in the country.

279
00:21:02,747 --> 00:21:06,989
行了，我做那种梦，都做了好多年了
Please, I have had such dreams for years.

280
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:09,870
该死的雨，黑狗
Bloody rain, black dogs,

281
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,391
戴着头罩的船夫…好多年了
hooded ferrymen- for years.

282
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,592
看看我 还是活得很好
Here I am, still alive and well.

283
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:17,273
我以前从来没有过那样的梦
I've never had such dreams before now.

284
00:21:20,794 --> 00:21:23,355
我应该怎么做？
What am I to do?

285
00:21:23,435 --> 00:21:25,606
我是不是应该离开罗马并藏起来
Should I quit Rome and hide

286
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:27,567
就是因为你做的恶梦？
because you have bad dreams?

287
00:21:27,647 --> 00:21:29,287
为什么不这么做？
Why not?

288
00:21:30,048 --> 00:21:32,368
我是认真的
I'm serious.

289
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,771
你对这里辛苦的工作，难道不感到厌倦吗？
Are you not weary of this toil?

290
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:43,533
是的，我感到非常厌倦
I am. I am extremely weary.

291
00:21:44,813 --> 00:21:47,734
但是有太多太多的事情要去做
But there is much more to be done,

292
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:50,335
不得不说，太多事情了
I'm afraid. Much more.

293
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,986
总有更多的事情要做
There's always more to be done.

294
00:21:55,187 --> 00:21:57,828
怎么算到头？
To what end?

295
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:01,389
到头？
What end?

296
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:03,870
问的好
Good question.

297
00:22:05,431 --> 00:22:07,592
我应该问问伯斯卡
I shall ask Posca.

298
00:22:10,673 --> 00:22:13,394
睡吧，亲爱的
Go to sleep, my dear.

299
00:22:17,695 --> 00:22:20,226
优利亚的先祖啊
AncestorsoftheJunii,

300
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:21,907
我们祈求你们的保佑
we ask for your blessing

301
00:22:21,947 --> 00:22:24,108
保佑这个有着你们血脉的人
on this man of your blood.

302
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:31,110
让他更有力量
Let his arm be strong.

303
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,792
让他能达成他的目的
Let his aim be true.

304
00:22:37,073 --> 00:22:40,834
让他的心中充满神圣的愤怒
Let his heart be filled with sacred rage.

305
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,491
好孩子
Good boy.

306
00:23:40,716 --> 00:23:42,727
你好
Hello.

307
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,291
你好
Hello.

308
00:24:00,974 --> 00:24:02,935
嗨，美女
Hey, venus,

309
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,975
我想问你个问题
I have a question for you.

310
00:24:06,216 --> 00:24:08,577
猜猜我是谁
Guess who I am.

311
00:24:29,314 --> 00:24:31,235
非常感激
Thanks very much.

312
00:24:31,315 --> 00:24:33,716
能认识你真是很好
It was nice to meet you.

313
00:24:33,796 --> 00:24:35,797
剩下的路我一个人就行了
I can manage from here.

314
00:24:53,093 --> 00:24:55,814
等等
Wait.

315
00:24:59,856 --> 00:25:01,856
嗯，大家都去哪儿了？
So, where is everybody?

316
00:25:29,357 --> 00:25:32,448
我肯定我见过那个人在市场里卖鱼
I'm sure I saw that one selling fish in the Forum.

317
00:25:32,528 --> 00:25:34,849
最起码他是个罗马人
Atleasthe's Roman.

318
00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:37,570
一个好的罗马鱼贩相比那些
A good Roman fishmonger is a fine nobleman

319
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,611
自称为首领的比利时跟凯尔特人
compared to some of these Belgian and Celts

320
00:25:39,691 --> 00:25:41,451
也能算的上真正的贵族了
that call themselves chiefs.

321
00:25:41,491 --> 00:25:44,052
看那边就有一个，戴耳环的那个
There's one over there with earrings.

322
00:25:51,255 --> 00:25:52,855
见到你真好
It's good to see you.

323
00:25:52,935 --> 00:25:54,896
最后就是这样，嗯？
It's the end, eh?

324
00:25:54,976 --> 00:25:57,137
高卢人进入到这里来了
The Gauls have invaded.

325
00:25:57,857 --> 00:26:00,988
不要这么郁闷，他们会走的
Well, don't be so glum. They will return

326
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:03,469
很会就会回到他们山谷中那些丑陋的小屋中
to their ghastly mountain hovels soon enough.

327
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:05,270
恺撒只在需要他们支持一些有辱元老院
Caesar will only summon them back

328
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,671
的行为的时候才会召唤他们来
when he needs their support for some fresh outrage.

329
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:09,632
跟着恺撒的那个人
The red man shadowing Caesar is

330
00:26:09,672 --> 00:26:11,953
我猜就应该是卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯
the famous Lucius vorenus, one assumes.

331
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:15,474
 没错  他们关系密切，对吧？
 lndeed.  Affectionate, aren't they?

332
00:26:15,554 --> 00:26:17,475
或许是父子
Might be father and son.

333
00:26:17,555 --> 00:26:20,796
恺撒会让那个低贱的人这么想的
Caesar would have the humble people think so.

334
00:26:20,836 --> 00:26:23,637
他总把那个卑贱的人带在身边
He keeps the wretched man by his side constantly.

335
00:26:23,677 --> 00:26:28,009
那个战场上的禽兽居然是罗马的元老！
This beast of the fields is a Senator of Rome!

336
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:30,690
别这么烦恼，卡斯卡
Do not fret so, Casca.

337
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,611
我们这些屈服于恺撒王的胆小鬼
We timid subjects of King Caesar

338
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:36,572
必须要学会忍受，对吧？
must learn to be tolerant, hmm?

339
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:38,813
我想我应该回家
I believe I shall go home

340
00:26:38,873 --> 00:26:41,093
通过喝酒来麻醉自己
and stupefy myself with wine.

341
00:26:41,574 --> 00:26:43,614
祝你们好
Good day to you all.

342
00:26:49,497 --> 00:26:50,897
老蠢货
Old fool.

343
00:27:09,874 --> 00:27:13,836
他知道了，我敢肯定，他知道了 你看到了他看我们的样子
He knows, I'm sure of it. He knows. You saw how he looked at us.

344
00:27:13,856 --> 00:27:15,936
冷静，辛伯 如果他知道了，我们早就应该死了
Be calm, Cimber. If he knew, we would be dead already.

345
00:27:15,956 --> 00:27:18,447
他装作不知情 他在等待我们露出马脚
He's playing the blind man. He's waiting for us  to betray ourselves.

346
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:20,438
 没错  他根本就不担心我们！
 Exactly. He's not worried about us!

347
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:23,329
我把我们都想成胆小鬼
 He thinks we are cowards.

348
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:25,330
那么，无论如何 我们必须要尽快行动
Well, in any case, we must act soon.

349
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,211
今天他让高卢人，凯尔特人跟平民进入元老院
Today he brings in Gauls and Celts and low plebs.

350
00:27:28,251 --> 00:27:30,492
他以后就会让比利时人，自由人
Tomorrow it'll be Belgians or freedmen, and he won't rest

351
00:27:30,492 --> 00:27:32,453
也进入元老院 不把元老院变成妓院
until he's turned the Senate into a bawdy house!

352
00:27:32,463 --> 00:27:34,693
他是不会善罢罢休的！

353
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:39,735
那些外来的乌合之众就会从人数上超过我们这些高贵的贵族
We good noblemen will be outnumbered by foreign rabble.

354
00:27:40,095 --> 00:27:41,936
我们将失去尊严
We will be degraded,

355
00:27:42,016 --> 00:27:43,337
失去权力
powerless.

356
00:27:43,377 --> 00:27:44,857
我们必须要尽快行动
 We must act soon.  What about bloody Lucius vorenus?

357
00:27:44,857 --> 00:27:46,778
那该死的卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯怎么办？
 Lucius vorenus is a son of a whore.  You know him personally, it seems.

358
00:27:46,858 --> 00:27:49,709
 卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯是个杂种而已  听起来你认识他？

359
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:51,710
我认识他
I know him.

360
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,830
我认识他
I know him.

361
00:27:55,191 --> 00:27:57,392
卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯是谁？
Who is Lucius vorenus?

362
00:27:57,472 --> 00:28:00,113
目前，不知你是否记得有个
You remember, Mother, the low soldier

363
00:28:00,193 --> 00:28:02,434
低贱的战士跳入竞技场就是为了救他的同伴？
that jumped into the arena to save a comrade?

364
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,915
我大概记得有这么回事
I remember something of the sort.

365
00:28:04,955 --> 00:28:08,876
恺撒为了迎合大众让他当上了元老
Well, Caesar's pandered to the mob and made him a senator.

366
00:28:09,036 --> 00:28:10,917
而且恺撒在元老院的时候
And when Caesar's in the Senate,

367
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:13,438
这条狗不离他主人左右
the dog never leaves his master's side.

368
00:28:13,518 --> 00:28:15,799
而且是条可怕的狗
And afearsomedog itis.

369
00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:16,849
所以…
So, if we are to reckon

370
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:21,531
如果我们要在元老院算计恺撒的话
with Caesar on the Senate floor,

371
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:24,452
我们必须把卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯也算计在内
we must reckon with Lucius vorenus also.

372
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,293
把他一起杀了，有什么问题？
Kill him as well. What's it matter?

373
00:28:27,013 --> 00:28:28,854
他是个受欢迎的人
He is a popular man.

374
00:28:28,894 --> 00:28:32,375
 又如何？我会杀了他  我要让人们站在我们这边
So? I'll kill him.  It is most important

375
00:28:32,455 --> 00:28:34,776
是非常重要的
that we keep the people on our side.

376
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:36,776
我们不能杀死他们的英雄
We cannot kill one of their heroes.

377
00:28:36,857 --> 00:28:39,257
这会成为整个事件的污点的
That would sully the whole business.

378
00:28:39,337 --> 00:28:41,538
只有暴君才…死
 Only the tyrant dies.  Kill Caesar in his bed then. He

379
00:28:41,538 --> 00:28:43,139
那么就在恺撒的床上把他解决了
 doesn't sleep with this man, does he?  Quintus.

380
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,990
 他不跟乌瑞纳斯一起睡，对吧？ 昆特斯！

381
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,311
还真不是个坏主意
It's not such a bad thought.

382
00:28:48,431 --> 00:28:49,711
我们可以…买通一些他的奴隶
We could bribe some of his slaves.

383
00:28:49,721 --> 00:28:54,813
收买他的厨子  收买他的试尝员毒死他
Buy off his cook. Buy off his taster. Poison him.

384
00:28:54,873 --> 00:28:58,395
各位，我们可不是在讨论什么卑鄙的谋杀！
Gentlemen, this is not some cheap murder!

385
00:29:01,956 --> 00:29:04,997
我们要做的是一件荣耀的事情
It is an honorable thing

386
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:08,758
所以必须要光明正大的去做
that we do, and it must be done honorably.

387
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:10,559
白天
In daylight.

388
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:12,810
在元老院里面
On the Senate floor.

389
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,931
我们自己动手
With our own hand.

390
00:29:19,252 --> 00:29:20,973
包括我在内
With my hand.

391
00:29:24,934 --> 00:29:27,255
是的，你是对的
You're right, of course.

392
00:29:28,256 --> 00:29:29,816
请原谅我
Forgive me.

393
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:33,017
真是太好了
That's all very well,

394
00:29:33,097 --> 00:29:34,578
但是怎么做呢？
but how?

395
00:29:35,138 --> 00:29:37,099
怎么做呢？
How?

396
00:29:55,356 --> 00:29:58,037
怎么了？
What's wrong?

397
00:30:00,037 --> 00:30:02,158
你还没有睡着吗？
Are you still awake?

398
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,250
你在那里长吁短叹的…
You were worrying very loudly.

399
00:30:14,893 --> 00:30:17,894
我感觉似乎一切都来得太快
I feel like everything seems to be moving so fast.

400
00:30:19,255 --> 00:30:21,255
就好像…
It feels like--

401
00:30:26,817 --> 00:30:28,738
我…
I'm--

402
00:30:28,818 --> 00:30:31,179
我有时很害怕
I'm scared sometimes.

403
00:31:14,175 --> 00:31:17,336
 卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯，那个是他的名字吗？ 什么啊？
 Lucius vorenus, was that his name?  What?

404
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:20,297
恺撒提拔成元老的那个低贱的战士
The low soldier that Caesar made a senator.

405
00:31:20,377 --> 00:31:21,778
那个是他的名字吗？
Was that his name?

406
00:31:21,818 --> 00:31:24,659
卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯 怎么了？
Lucius vorenus. Why?

407
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:27,220
我以前听过他的名字
I have heard the name before.

408
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,111
“我亲爱的朋友
"My dear friend,

409
00:31:30,151 --> 00:31:32,792
我为这段时间没有见到你们而感到惋惜
I regret I have not seen you or yours for some time.

410
00:31:32,872 --> 00:31:34,873
像我们这样交织相缠的两个家族
Two families as entwined as ours

411
00:31:34,953 --> 00:31:36,874
不应该成为陌路人
must not be strangers.

412
00:31:36,954 --> 00:31:38,874
不知你明天是否能方便
Would it be convenient for you

413
00:31:38,954 --> 00:31:40,595
到我这里来看我？
to come and visit me tomorrow?

414
00:31:41,105 --> 00:31:43,666
为了我们长久的友谊，赛维莉娅”
With great affection, Servilia."

415
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:46,427
太奇怪了
How strange.

416
00:31:46,507 --> 00:31:48,428
是吗？
Is it?

417
00:31:48,508 --> 00:31:50,429
她为什么想见我？她恨我
Why would she want to see me? She hates me.

418
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:54,350
我也一样，那又不能阻止她向你示好
So do l. It's no bar to friendship.

419
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,361
她想什么呢？
What is she thinking?

420
00:31:56,401 --> 00:31:57,841
肯定不是对你有好处的事情
Nothing to your benefit.

421
00:31:59,122 --> 00:32:02,723
 你会怎么做？ 我当然会答应
 What will you do?  I shall accept, of course.

422
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:04,724
 这么做明智吗？ 或许不
 Is that wise?  Probably not.

423
00:32:04,724 --> 00:32:06,925
她的愤怒使我愉快
Her rage amuses me.

424
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,845
你应该跟我一起去
You shall come with me.

425
00:32:09,966 --> 00:32:12,807
 为什么？ 当然是作为我的保护者
 Why?  To be my protector, of course.

426
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:15,288
谁知道那个疯狂的老乌龟会做什么？
Who knows what the mad old turtle will do?

427
00:32:15,288 --> 00:32:16,848
请不要这样说她
Please don't speak of her so.

428
00:32:16,928 --> 00:32:19,449
但是她就是个疯狂的老乌龟
Well she is a mad old turtle.

429
00:32:19,529 --> 00:32:23,101
无论怎样，我还以为你已经放低了那段低下的感情
Anyway, I thought you were above such petty emotions nowadays.

430
00:32:23,181 --> 00:32:25,862
我是的，我努力去那么做
I am. I try to be.

431
00:32:27,943 --> 00:32:30,383
你对她还有感觉
you still have feelings for her.

432
00:32:30,423 --> 00:32:32,784
 那也没什么错  我早已没有感觉了
 There's nothing wrong with that.  I feel nothing

433
00:32:32,864 --> 00:32:36,346
只是可怜她 也可怜那时候的我
but pity for her. And for myself as I was then.

434
00:32:36,386 --> 00:32:38,026
也可怜你
And for you.

435
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:39,467
我？
Me?

436
00:32:40,507 --> 00:32:42,388
你这只小笨鹅
You silly goose.

437
00:32:54,482 --> 00:32:57,764
 你为什么穿成这样？ 我要到城外去…
 Why are you dressed so?  I'm going to the country--

438
00:32:57,844 --> 00:33:01,005
只是今天而已 呼吸一下新鲜的空气
just for the day, to get some fresh air,

439
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:03,006
活动一下腿脚
stretch my legs.

440
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:07,127
我还想去一趟战场女神的神庙
I was thinking of stopping by the shrine of Sacred Rusina,

441
00:33:07,127 --> 00:33:10,929
问问她是否能够原谅我做的那些坏事
asking her if she'll forgive me for all the bad things I've done.

442
00:33:11,209 --> 00:33:13,570
你认为她会
You think she might?

443
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,131
原谅我吗？
Forgive me?

444
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:20,502
谁知道神会怎么答复你？
 Who knows what the gods will do?

445
00:33:24,263 --> 00:33:27,865
一起去 如果你想的话
Come along, if you like.

446
00:33:28,265 --> 00:33:30,746
元老院今日集会
Senate in session today.

447
00:33:30,826 --> 00:33:33,067
闲人不许在附近集会
No assemblies in the vicinity.

448
00:33:33,107 --> 00:33:35,788
不允许赌博 不允许卖淫
No gaming. No prostitution.

449
00:33:35,868 --> 00:33:39,509
愿所有的神都保佑我们神圣的长者
May all the gods bless our sacrosanct father

450
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:42,290
盖乌斯·优利乌斯·恺撒
Gaius Julius Caesar.

451
00:33:48,442 --> 00:33:50,843
 你好，元老  你好
 Good day, Senator.  Good day.

452
00:33:50,923 --> 00:33:53,684
长官，长官，请给我点时间！
Sir, sir, a moment of your time!

453

455
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,247
我亲爱的阿提娅

460
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,131
我也这么想
I like to think so.

461
00:34:11,491 --> 00:34:15,002
而且还这么英俊 进来，进来

这里看起来很好

464
00:34:54,807 --> 00:34:56,728
拉！

乌瑞纳斯元老

469
00:35:34,112 --> 00:35:36,323
优利亚家的赛维莉娅，而且我现在跟你说的

00:35:52,409 --> 00:35:56,170
回答我，那个孩子是怎么回事？

473

乌瑞纳斯在哪里？

474
00:36:13,306 --> 00:36:15,227
他刚才还跟我们在一起

475
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:16,628
无所谓了

00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,509
马克·安东尼，能跟我们谈一会吗？
Mark Anthony, why don't you give us a moment?

477
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,471
你肯定在想今天我为什么邀请你到这里

478

我还真是有些不解

其实，对我来说是非常重要的

和蔼的恺撒，如果我可以的话
If I may, gracious Caesar,

486
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:47,769
请您考虑一下赦免我兄弟的流放

487
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:49,490
我还在考虑中

把你的手拿开

00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:45,786
怎么了？
What's wrong?

495
00:39:49,307 --> 00:39:51,748
 他在哪里？ 谁啊？
 Where is he?  Who?

496

卢西尔斯

卢西尔斯
Lucius,

505

这个孩子是无罪的
the boy is blameless.

506
00:41:34,266 --> 00:41:37,627
暴君永远的下场

507
00:42:45,352 --> 00:42:47,633
不！
No!

那么你看，暴君死了

而且你又没有后台了 又恢复了共和

510
00:42:56,487 --> 00:42:59,208

511
00:43:01,488 --> 00:43:04,650
不用，谢谢

你为什么想要我们受到伤害？

516
00:43:13,493 --> 00:43:15,334
我们一直都是好朋友
We've always been great friends.

517
00:43:15,334 --> 00:43:18,335
 政治是男人的事情，我一直… 还没到时候

518
00:43:18,935 --> 00:43:21,626
我会慢慢折磨你的

慢慢的，深深的

520
00:43:24,467 --> 00:43:25,707
正如你折磨我一样

521
00:43:25,907 --> 00:43:28,789
首先，我想看到你逃跑

522

为了生命而逃跑

523

跑到希腊
Run to some rathole

00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:35,431
或者伊利里亚的某个角落

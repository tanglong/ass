	And the lictors had all run off like rabbits.
	那个该死的混帐乌瑞纳斯 他肯定是被收买了\N
	That treacherous bastard Vorenus, he must have been paid off.
	他在我们抵达元老院之前就走了\N
	He'd left before we got to the Senate House.
	他是被骗走的\N
	He was lured away.
	那个妖女赛维莉娅的女佣跟他说了关于他妻子的很不堪的事\N
	The witch Servilia's woman told him an evil tale about his wife.
	- 这样啊 你当时在干什么 - 我做了什么\N
	- What did you do then? - What did I do?
	怎么了 我什么也做不了\N
	Why, nothing I could do.
	凯撒已经死了 我又是赤手空拳\N
	Caesar was dead. I was unarmed.
	要是我 就凭双手把他们撕成碎片\N

	泰门 我们准备去北方 你跟你的手下要保护好这家人\N
	We're going north. You and your men will protect the family
	直到我能够把我所有的人都集结起来\N

	I expect no public service from a Jew.
	我们得把卡尔普蕊娜一起带走 所以得经过苏布拉\N
	We shall be taking Calpurnia with us, so we must leave via the Subura.
	卡尔普蕊娜\N
	Calpurnia?
	可为什么我们要带上她\N
	But why do we need to take her?
	我们必须保证她的安全\N
	We must be sure that she is safe.
	哼 我可没见她急着来问我们是不是安全\N
	Well, I don't see her rushing to see that we're safe.
	亲爱的 我们不能把凯撒的遗孀留下\N
	My dear, we cannot leave Caesar's widow behind.
	那会让给人们留下不好的印象 就如同我们抛弃了她一样\N
	It would look ill with the people, as if we'd abandoned her.

	What a bore.

	知道你能来 我丈夫会很高兴的\N
	My husband is glad to receive you.
	你是头一个来致哀的 真奇怪 我们的朋友和亲戚没有一个人来\N
	You're the first to pay respects. None of our friends or family have come.
	他们都害怕了\N
	They're afraid.
	是的 可能是吧\N
	Ah, yes, that may be so.
	我们现在要离开这个城市了\N
	We are going to leave the city now.
	你最好也跟我们一起走\N
	It's best you come with us.
	离开 为什么\N

	His will?
	对不起 我们可没这个时间\N
	No, I'm sorry. We haven't time.
	- 这是必要的形式 - 我们没时间\N
	- It is the proper form. - We haven't time.
	这份遗嘱\N
	It is the will...
	来自于罗马共和国的独裁者\N
	of a dictator of the Roman Republic.
	在确信保留了足够的安居乐业之用\N
	Having made due provision for the well-being and security
	给我忠实尽责的妻子卡尔普蕊娜之后\N
	of my honest and dutiful wife, Calpurnia, et cetera,
	我将分给每位已登记的公民75便士\N
	I leave the sum of 75 denarii to every enrolled citizen...
	哦 真是荒唐 太浪费了\N
	Ridiculous. What a waste.
	我的名字和其余的不动产\N
	My name and the remainder of my estate
	所有法定的债权与债务\N
	with all legal obligations and benefits,
	所有财物与黄金\N
	all property, gold,
	银币与其它货币\N
	silver and other monies,
	我都留给盖乌斯·屋大维\N
	I leave to Gaius Octavian,
	从此以后他将会被视为\N
	who is henceforth to be regarded
	我法定的儿子\N
	for all intents and purposes as my lawful son
	唯一的继承人\N
	and sole heir.
	屋大维 我的屋大维\N
	Octavian? My Octavian?
	还有什么？\N
	What else?
	他规定叫做伯斯卡的奴隶\N
	He stipulates that the slave known as Posca...
	就是我 将被赋予自由\N
	that is I... am to be given my liberty
	以及一份适当的津贴\N
	with an appropriate stipend.
	我赋予你享受你自由的权利\N

	没有其它要求了\N
	There are no further bequests.
	我知道了\N
	I see.

	Well, congratulations, boy.
	谢谢你 伯斯卡\N
	Thank you, Posca.
	屋大维得到全部一切 所有的\N
	Octavian gets everything? All of it?
	他什么也得不到 全都是空头支票\N
	He'll get nothing. It's all wax for scraping.
	这是一份遗嘱 这是 他依法拟定的遗嘱\N
	It's a will. It's his by law.
	现在布鲁图斯和他的爪牙就是法律\N
	The law is now Brutus and his minions.
	凯撒的土地和钱财会落入他们手中\N
	Caesar's land and money will go to them.
	就是这样 他们会把他的死 说成是合理的讨伐暴君的行为\N
	That is so. They will declare his death a rightful tyrannicide,
	他的遗嘱和所有法令都变得毫无效力\N
	his will and all his acts become null and void,
	他的财产会被充公\N
	his property will be intestate.
	- 他们不能夺去我的名字 - 当然不\N
	- They cannot take the name. - Oh, no.
	那还是你的\N
	That's all yours.
	希望能给你带来好运\N
	Much good may it do you.
	现在走吧\N
	Away now.
	我可能需要强行把卡尔普蕊娜带走\N
	I may have to take Calpurnia along by force,
	如果她叫嚷起来的话 别惊慌\N
	so don't be alarmed if she makes a clamor.
	嘿 去找你的女主人 告诉她我们要走了\N
	Hey, send for your mistress. Tell her we're leaving.
	母亲 我必须留在罗马\N
	Mother, I must stay in Rome.
	- 啊 - 我必须留在罗马\N
	- Eh? - I must stay in Rome.
	我是凯撒的儿子 我必须捍卫自己的身份与权利\N
	I am Caesar's son. I must protect my status and rights.
	真有血性 好一个斯巴达勇士\N
	There's blood. A proper little Spartan.
	母亲 你也应该留下\N
	You shall have to stay also, Mother.
	整个家应当团结一致\N
	The family must appear united.
	我那古怪 勇敢 好高骛远的孩子 我们还是去北方吧\N
	Oh, my strange, brave, pompous little boy, we're going north.
	我是一家之主\N
	I'm head of the family.
	严格来讲 应该由我决定我们去哪儿\N
	Strictly speaking, it is for me to say where we go.
	我知道你想充男子汉 那很可爱\N
	I know you're only trying to be manly and that's lovely.
	不过现在时机不对 我们一定要去北方 就这么定了\N
	But now is not the time. We are going and there's an end on it.
	安东尼 听我说 布鲁图斯处于一个法律上两难的困境\N
	Antony, listen. Brutus is in a legal bind.
	我认为可以强迫他跟我们定一个协议\N
	I think we can force him into making a deal with us.
	继续说\N
	Go on.
	布鲁图斯必须宣称凯撒是暴君 否则杀害凯撒就算是谋杀\N
	Brutus must declare Caesar a tyrant, else the act of killing Caesar is murder.
	然而暴君的所有法令都是不合法的\N
	But all the acts of a tyrant are unlawful,
	包括那些指定布鲁图斯作为执政官\N
	Including those appointing Brutus as Praetor,
	卡西乌斯当地方总督的法令\N
	Cassius as Proconsul,
	- 诸如此类 - 然后呢\N
	- and so forth. - And then so?
	如果布鲁图斯遵从法令\N
	If Brutus honors the law,
	他将失去所有头衔和地位\N
	he loses all rank and position.
	这只是法学家的夸夸其谈\N
	It's lawyers' prattle.
	我不这么认为 如果你向他们提供一个特赦\N
	I don't think so. If you offer them amnesty
	- 作为回报 - 特赦\N
	- in return... - Amnesty?
	我要生吃了他们的肝 还特赦\N
	I'm gonna eat their livers. Amnesty?
	你没听懂我的意思\N
	You're not following me.
	够了 你以为你比安东尼懂得还多\N
	Enough! You think you know better than Antony?
	- 你不明白 - 混蛋 非让我扇你一耳光吗\N
	- But you don't understand. - Juno's cunt, must I slap you?
	如果遗嘱生效 而且它肯定会\N
	If the will stands, and it might,
	你就是全罗马最富有的母亲了\N
	you are mother to the richest man in Rome.
	如果遗嘱被废 赛维莉娅就得到了这份殊荣\N
	If the will is broken, Servilia has that honor.
	不行\N
	No.
	那该死的女人在哪儿\N
	Where is this damn woman?
	当我冲你点头的时候 我要你帮忙抓住那老女人\N
	When I give you the nod, I want you to help me seize the old lady
	快点把她带到外面去 她很信任你 是吧\N
	and get her outside quick. She trusts you, nay?
	- 阁下 怀着无比敬意 - 什么\N
	- Sir, with all respect... - What?
	怀着无比敬意 直到遗嘱被认可前\N
	With all respect, until the will is ratified,
	我都必须服侍凯撒一家人 基于这一点\N
	I am bound to serve the house of Caesar.
	我必须请求您不要强行带走我的女主人\N
	With that in mind, I must beg you not to take my mistress by force.
	- 怀着无比敬意 - 还敬意\N
	- With all respect. - Respect?
	你这无耻的蛤蟆\N
	You impudent toad.
	你要照我说的做 我高兴怎么对你该死的女主人都行\N
	You'll do as I say, and I will do as I please with your damn mistress.
	安东尼\N
	Antony?
	我们不走了\N
	We're staying.
	不用了 谢谢你 主人\N
	No, thank you, master.
	你不要再那么叫我了\N
	You've got to stop calling me that.
	那我该叫你什么 随你喜欢\N
	What shall I call you, then?
	丈夫或者亲爱的\N
	Anything you want. Husband? Honey?
	凯撒死了 凯撒死了\N
	Caesar is dead! Caesar is dead!
	凯撒死了\N
	Caesar is dead.
	凯撒死了\N
	Caesar is dead!
	别担心\N
	Don't worry.
	该回来的总会回来\N
	If he comes back, he comes back.
	好了\N
	There.
	看她多漂亮\N
	See how fine she looks?
	她会受到尊敬的\N
	She'll be well respected.
	一个出身良好的女人\N
	A woman from good people.
	你们好啊 孩子们\N
	Hello, children.
	不朽功绩\N
	Immortals!
	不朽功绩 我要说\N
	Immortals, I say.
	你们的名字将被深深地刻在\N
	You noblemen have carved your names
	永生石上\N
	deep in the eternal stone.
	很高的赞誉\N
	That is very high praise indeed.
	我本想拥抱你们 但我太失望了\N
	I would embrace you all but I'm desolated
	你们竟然没有把我 列为这场英雄壮举中的一员\N
	that you did not enlist me in your cohort of heroes.
	为自由而举刀\N
	To wield the liberators' knife...
	使我不能得到你们所获得的快乐\N
	what joy you have denied me.
	原谅我们\N
	Forgive us.
	不过我们觉得你希望还是不要知道好\N
	But we rather thought you'd prefer not to know.
	事已成了\N
	It is done.
	我无法分享你们的荣耀\N
	I cannot share in your glory.
	我只有为你们鼓掌了\N
	I can only applaud.
	告诉我 罗马城安全吗\N
	Now tell me, is the city secure?
	我们有2000名全副武装的战士\N
	We have 2,000 men under arms.
	- 凯撒的人都四散逃了 - 罗马是我们的了\N
	- Caesar's people have fled. - The city is ours.
	好极了 走狗马克·安东尼 我想也死了吧\N
	Excellent, and Mark Antony? The dog is dead I hope?
	- 他没死 - 马克·安东尼还活着\N
	- He is not. - Mark Antony is alive?
	这是个错误\N
	An error!
	很大的错误 我认为\N
	I think, a deep error.
	我们是元老院成员 不是暴徒\N
	We are senators, not hired thugs.
	你要想他死自己动手吧\N
	Kill him yourself if you want it so.
	当然你们最清楚该做什么\N
	Well, well, you know best what is the right thing to do.
	我必须走了 去乡下\N

	Surely the people should be happy.
	欢呼声在哪儿\N
	Where is the cheering throng at your door?
	获得自由后高兴的哭喊在哪儿\N
	Where are the joyous cries of liberty?
	人民害怕改变\N
	The people fear change.

	他们会高兴的\N
	the people will be glad.
	人民爱凯撒\N
	The people loved Caesar.

	什么大选\N
	What elections?

	如果你们坚持说凯撒是个暴君\N

	我不再是执政官\N

	凯撒的法律和遗嘱 仍然成立\N
	All Caesar's acts, and his will, shall stand.

	You people play too rough
	对于我这样一个纯粹的战士来说\N
	for a simple soldier like me.
	在元老院里动刀\N
	Knives in the Senate House?
	没想到你还是这块料\N
	Didn't think you had it in you.
	如果我们不接受你的提议呢\N
	And if we do not wish to be reconciled with you?
	非友即敌\N
	Well, if we cannot be friends, then we shall be enemies.
	我会竭尽所能把你们全部消灭\N
	And I will do my very best to annihilate you.
	能否给我们一些时间商量商量\N
	Perhaps you would give us some time to talk this over?

	一个轼君者加傻瓜\N
	A killer and a fool.
	你个人荣誉比共和国更重要吗\N
	Is your honor worth more than the Republic?
	还不晚\N
	It is not too late.
	他就在这儿 在你们手里\N
	He's here, in your hands.
	我只是在陈述事实\N
	I'm simply stating the facts.
	我可没有强迫你采取什么行动\N
	I do not urge you to any particular course of action.
	你所谓没有强迫我的事我不会做的\N

	兄弟\N
	Brother.
	这是唯一理智的做法\N
	It is the only rational thing to do.
	他没有违反法律\N
	He's broken no capital law.

	And he offers a truce which will preserve the public order.
	- 我们没有权利杀他 - 去他的法律吧 他活着是威胁\N
	- We have no right to take his life. - Damn the law! He's too dangerous to live.
	你高看他了 他只是个下流的禽兽\N
	You exaggerate him. He is a vulgar beast.
	没有了凯撒他很快就会自毁前程\N
	Without Caesar he will destroy himself soon enough.
	- 他是 - 他是我家里的客人\N

	别担心 他们会回来的\N
	Don't worry, they'll be back.
	然后你可以解除诅咒 没问题的 你没有杀牛宰羊吧\N
	You can lift the curse then, no trouble. You didn't kill an animal on it, did you?
	- 没有 - 那就没问题了\N
	- No. - There you go, then.
	诅咒没有生效\N
	The curse isn't sealed.
	等他们回来了 你就能解除了 不会有伤害\N

	but soon I must tell him
	他父亲的臣民不接受他\N

	我们没有政治意图\N

	只不过想让我孩子开心一点\N
	merely the happiness of my boy.
	简单地公布一下\N
	A simple public declaration

	If I must prostitute myself
	来换取我的国家和家族的利益\N
	for the good of my country and my family,

	至少伊拉斯特斯·弗尔曼还活着的时候\N
	but when Erastes Fulmen was alive
	艾文台山上可是一切太平\N
	there was peace on the Aventine.
	现在城里的所有黑帮 都为了争夺山上的控制权打成一团\N
	Now every gang in the city's fighting for control of the hill.
	每一天街上都充斥着暴力 每一日都是杀声震天\N
	Every day there's violence, every day there's...
	呼 哈\N
	hoo-ha.
	- 这会断送贸易 - 我会料理的\N
	- It's killing commerce. - I will see to it.
	难道贸易不是公民道德的根基么？\N
	And is not commerce the root of civic virtue?
	如果贸易被扼杀 罗马难道还能…\N
	Can Rome long survive if commerce is...
	你可以走了\N
	You may go.
	必须…\N
	Something...
	必须对艾文台山采取措施\N
	Something must be done on the Aventine.
	是的 是的 我知道了 我满耳朵灌的都是这种事\N
	Yes, yes, I know. I hear of nothing else.
	黑帮不会停止他们之间的战争\N
	The gangs will not stop fighting of their own accord.
	不管最后谁控制了艾文台 这个代价都太大了\N
	It is too rich a prize. Whoever controls the Aventine
	控制港口和粮食供应\N
	controls the docks and the grain supply...
	- 我都知道 - 暴力还会蔓延\N
	- I am aware! - The violence will spread.
	如果不加制止 整个城市都会很快\N
	If it is not stopped, the whole city will swift descend
	陷入一片混乱和饥荒 我恐怕你会为此受到指责\N
	into chaos and famine and you will be blamed, I'm afraid.
	尽管这不是你的错 可还是…\N
	Though it'd be none of your fault, of course. Still...
	我会处理的\N
	I will handle it.
	现在\N
	Now...
	你找我有什么事？\N
	what can I do for you?
	- 是你找我来的 - 哦 是的 关于那件事\N
	- You sent for me. - Oh, yes, that.
	给他看看\N
	Show him.
	简直就是城里所有流氓地痞的名录\N
	It appears to be a list of every dishonest rascal in the city.
	真滑稽\N
	Very droll.
	这是名单选举的候选人名单\N
	It is a list of candidates for next year's elections
	是我们敬爱的凯撒去世前写好的\N
	drawn up by our beloved Caesar just before he was taken from us.
	伯斯卡在他的文件堆里找到的\N
	Posca found it amongst his papers.
	喔 幸运的大发现啊 你还真是不可思议啊 伯斯卡\N
	Another lucky find? You are prodigious, Posca.
	我需要你认可这份名单\N
	I want your endorsement of the names.
	出于团结与友好的名义 诸如此类\N
	For the sake of unity and amity, et cetera, et cetera.
	这是不是有点太无耻了？\N
	Isn't that being just a little too brazen?
	谁会相信凯撒能挑这种卑鄙小人出来\N
	Who would believe that Caesar chose such wretches?
	你总不会认为这些人出钱贿赂我 好把名字加到单子上吧？\N
	Surely you don't think those men paid me to put their names on the list?
	当然不\N
	Not at all.
	我认为他们贿赂了伯斯卡\N
	I expect they have paid Posca.
	- 那么 还有什么问题？- 我的背书会变得一钱不值\N
	- So, what's the problem? - My endorsement will be worthless.
	人们会认为我是被你胁迫的\N
	People will merely assume I've been intimidated by you.
	- 难道你不是被胁迫吗？- 不完全是\N
	- Are you not intimidated? - Not especially.
	现在你还不敢杀我\N
	At present, you cannot afford to kill me.
	你需要我来管理元老院\N
	You need me to run the Senate.
	今天 我需要你\N
	Today, I need you.
	- 到了明天… - 到了明天我再担心吧\N
	- Tomorrow... - Then tomorrow I will worry.
	今天 我建议你让我把这名单上 最卑劣的无赖剔除掉\N
	Today, I suggest you let me strike the worst scoundrels off this list.
	然后我才会签字\N
	Then I will endorse it.
	很好 很好 随你喜欢吧\N
	Fine, fine. Do as you like.
	乐意效劳\N
	A pleasure as always.
	接下来 有一个委托\N
	Next there is a delegation...

	马上就去 你走之前\N
	Immediately. Before you go,
	是不是可以谈一下我的补偿和委任的事？\N
	if I might raise the matter of my recompense and commission?
	不 不 不行 你这肮脏的希腊窃贼\N
	No! No, you might not, you wretched Greek thief!

	Legionary Pullo?
	等一下 让他过来\N
	Hold it. Let him through.
	阁下\N
	Sir!
	你在这儿干什么？\N
	What are you doing here?
	替卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯祈求建议与忠告 长官\N
	Requiring advice and counsel regarding Lucius Vorenus, sir.
	继续说\N
	Go on.
	他已经迷糊了 长官\N
	He has gone awry, sir.
	我不知道该替他做什么\N
	I don't know what's to be done with him.
	乌瑞纳斯 长官来了\N
	Vorenus! Officers afoot!
	百夫长乌瑞纳斯\N
	Centurion Vorenus.
	- 曾经是 - 阁下？\N
	- As was. - Sir?
	看你这个死样子\N
	Look at the fucking state of you.
	- 这是丧服 长官 - 丧服？\N
	- It's mourning dress, sir... - Mourning?
	你当然该哀悼\N
	You may well mourn.
	恺撒都已经死了\N
	Caesar is dead,
	就跟你亲手下的刀子一样\N
	and it was you as good as held the knife.
	我说话的时候你他妈的给我立正站好\N
	Stand to fucking attention when I'm talking to you!
	你知不知道你的名誉已经被永远地玷污了？\N
	You know that your name is disgraced forever?
	我知道 长官\N
	I do, sir.
	“我知道 长官”\N
	"I do, sir."
	那你干吗还活着？\N
	Why, then, are you still alive?
	你怎么不去尽忠\N
	Why have you not done your damn duty
	把肚子剖开\N
	and opened your stomach?
	我比谁都想那么做 长官\N
	I would like that above all things, sir.
	但是冥神掌管了我的一切\N
	But Dis is my master,
	他会在适当的时候取走我的性命\N
	and he will take me when he chooses.
	现在 他希望我留在世上受折磨\N
	At present, he wishes me to suffer here on this earth.
	你错了 百夫长\N
	You are wrong, Centurion.
	冥神不是你的主人\N
	Dis is not your master.
	我才是\N
	I am your master.
	遵照第13军团\N
	By sacred oath under the standards
	神圣的誓言和军规\N
	of the 13th.
	长官\N
	Sir.
	还有这个 我收下了 他曾是伊拉斯特斯·弗尔曼\N
	And this, I take it, was Erastes Fulmen.
	我告诉过他把这个扔掉\N
	I told him to get rid,
	可看着这东西能让他平静下来\N
	but it calms him to look at the thing.
	还不肯让这位教父死去\N
	Not content to let our great father die,
	你在艾文台山上挑起了一场战争\N
	you start a damn war on the Aventine
	几乎要毁掉整个城市\N
	that threatens to engulf the whole fucking city.
	现在\N
	Now...
	想不想赎罪 百夫长？\N
	would you like a chance to redeem yourself, Centurion?
	无法赎罪的\N
	There's no redemption.
	没有谁是不能赎罪的 卢西尔斯\N
	No man is beyond redemption, Lucius.
	连你也不例外\N
	Not even you.
	然后呢？\N
	And so?
	然后什么？\N
	And so?
	那个埃及女人 老实交待\N
	The Egyptian girl. Tell all.
	这个嘛 她全身光溜溜地\N
	Well, she was naked
	祭司们甚至还没离开房间呢\N
	before the priests had left the room.
	我不得不喊我的人进来把她从我身上拉下去\N
	I had to call my people to pull her off me.
	说真的\N
	Seriously.
	她正在悼念亡者\N
	She was in mourning.
	庄重而肃穆\N
	She was very gray and formal.
	她看上去像只小耗子\N
	She was quite the little mouse.
	以朱庇特的名义起誓？\N
	On Jupiter's stone?
	用他老婆的那玩意起誓\N
	On Juno's cunt.
	唉 没有 没发生什么有趣的事\N
	Nothing at all interesting happened.
	啊 她倒确实要求我正式承认\N
	Oh, she did ask me to formally recognize
	她的小崽子是恺撒的儿子\N
	her bastard as Caesar's son.
	真够无耻的\N
	Blasted impudence!
	你肯定拒绝了 对吧？\N
	You refused, of course.
	屋大维才是唯一…\N
	Octavian is the only...
	是的 是的 我当然拒绝了\N
	Yes, yes, of course I refused.
	结果女王陛下的眼泪\N
	Which set off a great flood
	都快要把我淹没了\N
	of royal whining.
	不 真是狗屎般的一天 到处都是\N
	No, it's been a pig of a day all around.
	统治这个城市根本不像我当初以为的那样有趣\N
	Running this damn city isn't nearly as amusing as I thought it would be.
	- 嗯 可怜的小羊羔 - 啊 天哪\N
	- Poor lamb. - God
	毫无疑问\N
	More tedium to follow
	明天的晚宴还有更多闷死人的东西\N
	at this damn dinner tomorrow, no doubt.
	赛维莉娅会来吗？\N

	我想是没有\N
	I should think not.
	你妈妈在哪儿？\N
	Where's your mother?
	- 有什么事不对吗？- 很有可能\N
	- Something wrong? - Possibly.
	啊 老天爷啊 她来这儿干什么？\N
	Juno's mercy. What's she doing here?
	我猜安东尼需要表现出团结\N
	I suppose Antony wants a show of unity
	给那些埃及人看\N
	for the Egyptians.
	我亲爱的赛维莉娅 你能来真是太好了\N
	Servilia, my love, it's good of you to come.
	我是强烈反对来这儿的 马克·安东尼坚持这么做\N
	I am here under protest. Mark Antony's insistence.
	他总是那么欺负人 不是吗？\N
	He's a terrible bully, isn't he?
	你一定是吓坏了\N
	You must be very scared.
	一点也不\N
	Not in the slightest.
	不过 你可不用怕我\N
	Well, you need have no fear of me.
	我可不想伤害你 真的\N
	I wish you no harm, truly.
	知道我已经赢了而你被踩在脚下 这就已经足够了\N
	It's enough for me to know that I have won and you've been humbled.
	我们都已经经历得够多的了\N
	We've both suffered enough.
	你在嘲讽我 我想是的\N
	You are mocking me, I believe.
	完全不是 我向你提供的可是友谊\N
	Not at all. I'm offering you friendship
	还有和解\N
	and reconciliation.
	你怎么说？\N
	What do you say?
	两个老朋友再回到一起\N
	Two friends together?
	在道义上我怎么能拒绝呢？\N
	I cannot honorably refuse.
	我还真是高兴啊\N
	I'm so happy.

	Kiss me, my dear.
	享受这个晚宴吧\N
	Enjoy the party.
	你看到她脸上的表情了？真是千金难买\N
	Did you see the look on her face? Priceless.
	我看见泰门和他的人守在院子里\N
	Mother, I saw Timon and some of his men in the yard.
	一群刀斧手\N
	Knife-and-hatchet men.
	- 然后呢？- 我在想他们来这儿干什么？\N
	- So? - I was wondering what they're doing here.
	保安啰 还能有什么？\N
	Security, what else?
	最明显的目的不外乎绑架或是杀掉赛维莉娅\N
	Their obvious purpose would be the abduction and killing of Servilia
	- 只等她今晚离开时动手 - 真是胡说八道\N
	- as she leaves this evening. - That's absurd.
	祭司们可是都认可了停火的\N
	There's a truce ratified by priests.
	- 你不可以伤害她 - 停火？祭司？\N
	- You can't harm her. - A truce? Priests?
	你认为那条母狗会放在眼里吗？\N
	You think that bitch cares?
	现在有太多事情比你复仇的渴望还要危险\N
	Mother, there is more at stake here than your desire for vengeance.
	政治局势非常敏感\N
	The political situation is extremely delicate.
	她的死会把共和国再次推向骚乱的\N
	Her death would throw the Republic into uproar.
	- 我可管不着 - 你真是孩子气\N
	- I don't care. - You're being childish.
	安东尼知道这事吗？\N
	Does Antony know of this?
	他当然知道\N
	Of course he does.
	好吧 他不知道 这很明显 还有 你可不要去告诉他\N
	All right, he doesn't, obviously. And don't you dare tell him.
	对不起了 妈妈\N
	I'm sorry, mother.
	你这个小混蛋\N
	You little bastard.
	我不需要你了 你现在可以走了\N
	I won't be needing you. You can go now.
	你那些该死的埃及人在哪儿？都该上菜了\N
	Where is your damned Egyptian? It's time to serve dinner.
	我真想宣布全部这些都取消\N
	I have a good mind to cancel the whole damn thing.
	喔 别生气 你知道这样是不对的\N
	Don't sulk, you know you're in the wrong.
	跟你形容的一样\N

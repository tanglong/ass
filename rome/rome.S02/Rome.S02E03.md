	I was thinking about Macedonia.
	是吗？我们一定得去吗？\N
	Were you?
	难道我们不能留在这儿吗？\N
	Do we have to go? Can't we just... stay here?
	不行\N
	No.
	等我的任期一结束 我们就走\N
	Once my consulship is over, we're gone.
	可是那儿离罗马太远了\N
	But it's so far from Rome.
	那儿也有裁缝\N
	They have dressmakers
	和珠宝商 在那不毛之地和在这儿都一样\N
	and jewel merchants in Odessa just like here.
	一旦你离开意大利\N
	Once you're gone from Italy
	你的敌人就不再害怕你了\N

	和平与安宁？\N
	Peace and quiet?
	当你在马其顿大灌黄汤 你认为布鲁图斯和卡西乌斯会不管？\N
	While you're swilling wine in Macedonia, will Brutus and Cassius be idle?

	- 我的兄弟 - 那人是谁？\N
	- Brother! - Who was that man?
	- 哪个？- 你刚刚说话的那个\N
	- Who? - The man you were speaking with.
	噢 你是说巴拉克 他是个香料商\N
	You mean Barak. He's a saffron trader.
	我觉得可不像\N
	Doesn't look like a saffron trader.
	又不是所有人都表里如一 对吧\N
	Not everybody looks like what they are.
	公正 公会长\N
	Justice, Captain!
	- 我乞求公正 - 这是谁？\N
	- I beg for justice! - Who's this?
	昆特斯·布波和他的妻子\N
	Quintus Bubo and his wife.
	昆特斯被曼米欧的手下给阉割了\N
	Gelded by Memmio's boys.
	求求你 公会长 给我们主持公道\N
	Please, Captain, justice!
	好了 冷静下来 兄弟\N
	Come on. Calm down, brother.
	那老家伙不该若无其事地到处溜达\N
	He shouldn't have been goating around.
	- 曼米欧违背了我的命令 - 他至少没有干掉那个老傻瓜\N
	- Memmio disobeyed me. - He didn't kill the old fool at least.
	- 他违背了我的命令 - 让我去跟曼米欧说说\N
	- He disobeyed me! - Let me go talk to Memmio.
	- 我会进行调解的 - 不用\N
	- I'll sort out a compromise. - No.
	如果你为了这么点小事就惩罚卡尔波\N
	If you punish Carbo over this trivia,
	曼米欧会认为你不尊重他\N
	Memmio is going to take it as disrespect.
	他会报复的 你将挑起一场黑帮大战\N
	He'll retaliate. You'll start a gang war.
	很有可能 但是我别无选择\N
	Very likely, but I've got no choice.
	- 而且这都是你的错 - 什么？这怎么成了我的错？\N
	- And it's your fault. - What? How is it my fault?
	你当着曼米欧的面质疑了我的权威\N
	You questioned my authority.
	- 这让他有了理由违背我的命令 - 胡扯\N
	- That gave him license to disobey me. - Oh, bollocks.
	现在 你要去找卡尔波\N
	Now, you go and find Carbo.
	把他对我表示出的不敬还给他\N
	You show him the same disrespect that he has shown me.
	- 大家都有错 - 我是在命令你\N
	- Everyone is in the wrong here. - I gave you an order.
	这里又不是军营 我不听任何人的命令\N
	This isn't the mumpin' Legion. I take orders from no man.
	那么你对我就没用了 你 去做吧\N
	Then you're no use to me. You, go and do it.
	我会的 头儿\N
	Will do, Captain.
	你完全想岔了\N
	You are thinking all backwards.
	我警告过你不要质疑我的权威 你了解自己的地位\N
	I warned you about questioning my authority. You learn your place.
	我的地位？去你妈的混帐东西\N
	My place? Well, fuck you, you miserable bastard,
	是我一直护着你活下来\N
	I'm the one trying to keep you alive.
	除了挑起黑帮大战你什么都不想 是吧？\N
	You'd love to start a gang war.
	你尽管去找死吧 了结你所有的怨气\N
	Get yourself killed. Put an end to all your misery.
	让半个城市给你陪葬\N
	Take half the city with you.
	让我来告诉你 你可以死上一千次\N
	Well, I tell you what. You can die a thousand times.
	也不可能让内奥比 或者孩子们或者恺撒活过来\N
	And it won't bring back Niobe or the children or Caesar!
	听着 我是你的朋友 我只是想帮你\N
	Listen, I'm your friend. I'm trying to help.
	- 你从来没有帮助过我 - 我没有？\N
	- You've never helped me. - Have I not?
	那么是谁一次又一次救下你的性命？\N
	Well, who saved your life a dozen times?
	是谁料理了那个卑鄙的伊万德？\N
	Who took care of that snake Evander?
	你喝醉了是谁把你扶回家？\N
	Who carried you home when... when you were drunk?
	你什么意思？\N
	What do you mean?
	什么“料理了伊万德”\N
	"Took care of Evander."
	没事 什么意思都没有\N
	Nothing... I didn't mean anything.
	你什么意思？\N
	What do you mean?
	说呀\N
	Speak.
	是我杀了他\N
	I killed him.
	我知道他做的事情之后就杀了他\N
	I found out what he'd done and killed him.
	听着 她爱的是你\N
	Listen, she loved you.
	你们俩在一起才是幸福的 如果我告诉了你 你也会杀了他\N
	You were happy together. If I'd told you, you would have killed her.
	出去\N
	Get out!
	我还能怎么做？\N
	What was I supposed to do?
	滚出去\N
	Get out.
	阿提娅还好吧 我想\N
	Atia thrives, I trust?
	是的 是的\N
	She does. She does.
	家里其他人呢？\N
	And the rest of the family?
	都挺好的\N
	Good enough.
	他真是个让人吃惊的孩子 不是吗？\N
	Yes, a surprising boy, isn't he?
	屋大维 这么小的孩子就这么有冲劲\N
	Octavian. Such vim and vigor for one so young.
	他们说他召集的军队数量可是相当地庞大\N
	They say it's a considerable army he's raised.
	从平原上买些傻子瘸子\N
	Buying up all the fools and cripples in Campania
	可组建不了一支军队\N
	is hardly raising an army.
	你是对的毫无疑问\N
	You are right, no doubt.
	不过里面也有不少老兵\N
	But many are veterans also.
	第八军团 还有第七军团的人\N
	Eighth Legion men. Seventh Legion.
	那些人光拿钱不干活\N
	Sat on their backsides taking his money
	等他走过时就欢呼“万岁”\N
	to cheer him as he goes by.
	恺撒他算个屁\N
	Caesar my arse.
	不过我叫你来不是为了谈小孩子的事\N
	But I didn't bring you here to talk of children.
	当然 我洗耳恭听\N
	Indeed, I await your pleasure.
	当我执政官的任期满了之后\N
	When my term as consul is over...
	我不想再要马其顿的控制权\N
	I no longer wish to take the governorship of Macedonia.
	我要高卢\N
	I wish to take Gaul.
	但是德奇姆斯才是高卢的统治者\N
	But Decimus is Governor of Gaul.
	要是他喜欢 就把马其顿拿去好了\N
	Well, he can have Macedonia if he likes.
	我要的是高卢 那儿天气更好\N
	I want Gaul. The weather's better.
	我恐怕这有点难度\N
	I'm afraid that will be a bit difficult.
	元老院恐怕会忖度你打算仿效恺撒\N
	The Senate may suppose you plan to emulate Caesar,
	陈兵边境\N
	camping your legions on our border.
	靠近罗马\N
	Close enough to Rome
	威胁我们好让你为所欲为\N
	to scare us into doing anything you wish.
	别慌 我可从来没这么想\N
	Steady on. Hadn't even crossed my mind.
	我只不过比较喜欢高卢\N
	I just prefer Gaul.
	但你也应该理解为什么元老院\N
	But you understand why the Senate
	会拒绝通过这个提议\N
	would not pass such a measure?
	你不就是元老院吗 西赛罗\N
	You are the Senate, Cicero.
	下次元老院开会时\N
	The next time we meet,
	也许你就该提议让我接管高卢\N
	perhaps you will propose my governorship of Gaul.
	没有人会惹麻烦的 如果有德高望重的西赛罗支持我的话\N
	No one can make any trouble if the noble Cicero is backing me.
	我不认为这是个好主意\N
	I don't think that's a good idea.
	倒不是我不愿意助你一臂之力\N
	Not that I do not wish to help you...
	作为朋友\N
	as a friend.
	但是元老院会认为我支持你\N
	But the Senate would know I was backing you
	只不过是因为怕死\N
	only through... through fear of death.
	啊 我明白了\N
	I understand.
	你不想给人当成胆小鬼\N
	You do not want to seem cowardly.
	告诉他们我贿赂了你\N
	Well, tell them I bribed you.
	你肯接受贿赂吗？\N
	Would you accept a bribe?
	我不能\N
	I would not.
	哦 钱太多了 是吧？\N
	Rich enough?
	不过至少值得说来一试\N
	Well, it's always worth a try.
	那么 你让我只剩下唯一的选择\N
	Well, you leave me only one option, then.
	最后总会走到这一步\N
	It always comes to this.
	我知道了\N
	I know.
	真抱歉\N
	I'm sorry.
	我们一起度过了多少时光啊\N
	Such times we live in.
	那就来吧\N
	Please, go on.
	尽管威胁我吧\N
	Make your threats.
	我可不愿因为一点点暗示就屈服\N
	I don't like to submit to mere implication.
	有个问题我一直都想问你\N
	There is a question I've always wanted to ask you.
	你的老朋友 克拉苏\N
	Your old friend Crassus,
	帕提亚人俘虏他的时候\N
	when he was captured by the Parthians,
	他们是不是真的 把融化的金子倒进了他的喉咙？\N
	is it true that they poured molten gold down his throat?
	因为那样真的会很痛\N
	Because that would really sting.
	谢谢你\N
	Thank you.
	你说的是对的\N
	It is correct, what you say.
	马其顿那儿的天气确实有点\N
	The weather in Macedonia is...
	恐怖\N
	dreadful.
	我以为你还想多知道一点\N
	I thought maybe you'd want to know a bit more
	- 我提到的事情 - 我不想\N
	- than what I said. - I don't.
	你应该知道内奥比没有… 她没有…\N
	You should know Niobe wasn't...
	不许提她\N
	Don't speak of her.
	那都是过去的事 已经结束了\N
	It's in the past. It is done.
	兄弟 我很抱歉要对你隐瞒\N
	Brother, I'm sorry I kept it from you.
	我认为那是为你好 我很抱歉\N
	I thought it was for the best. I'm sorry.
	我原谅你了 兄弟\N
	I forgive you, brother.
	我理解你为什么不告诉我 我理解\N
	I understand why you didn't tell me. I understand.
	- 我听到你说的了 但是… - 我是说真的\N
	- I hear you say that, but... - I mean it.
	我原谅你\N
	I forgive you.
	我怎么能不原谅你呢 波罗？\N
	How could I not forgive you, Pullo?
	你是我生命里剩下的一切了\N
	You're all I've got left in life.
	一直让我活命的人 啊？\N
	Keeping me alive?
	说到那个 跟西莲那帮人的事\N
	This business with the Caelians...
	- 怎么了？- 我们还是可以阻止开战的\N
	- What of it? - We can still stop it turning into a war.
	让卡尔波付一笔罚金\N
	Let Carbo pay a fine.
	如果我悄悄去跟曼米欧谈\N
	If I go and talk quietly to Memmio
	事情能解决也没有人会丢面子\N
	we can sort it out so that no one loses face.
	你以前就说过了\N
	You suggested that before.
	值得去做 总比开战好\N
	Worth a go. Better than a war.
	也许你是对的 也许\N
	You may be right. You may be.
	不过现在太晚了\N
	But it's too late now.
	出去\N
	Move.
	你好吗 卡尔波\N
	Salve, Carbo.
	拎起来\N
	Get him up.
	不\N
	No!
	告诉你的女主人我有她儿子的口信\N
	Tell your mistress I have a message from her son.
	活见鬼\N

	凯撒的朋友\N
	a friend of Caesar...

	of Octavian as was.
	您是他的姐姐奥克塔维娅吗？\N
	Have I the honor of speaking to his sister Octavia?
	是 我弟弟来了吗？\N
	Yes. Is my brother here?
	没出什么事吧？他还好吗？\N
	There's nothing wrong, is there? He's all right?
	不… 是的\N
	No... Yes.
	我是说 不 他没来 是的 他一切都好\N
	I mean, no, he's not here. But yes, he's well.
	我5天前出发的时候 他还活蹦乱跳的\N
	I left him five days ago, thriving.
	很快乐\N
	Happy.
	- 他让我替他问您好 - 没有信吗？\N
	- I am to convey his best wishes to you. - No letter?
	我告诉他该写封信 但您知道他的脾气\N
	I told him he ought to write, but you know how he is.
	请坐\N
	Please.
	虽然没有写信 但他让我转告您 他还是一如既往的爱您\N
	In place of writing, I am charged to tell you that he loves you as ever
	并且让我回答任何您提出的问题\N
	and to answer any questions you may have,
	只要不牵涉到政治机密\N
	consonant with political security.
	他自大的毛病一点没改\N

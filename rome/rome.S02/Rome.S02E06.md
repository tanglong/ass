	This can't be right.
	我已经和他们谈过了\N
	I've been talking with the men.
	他们没想到希腊有这么大\N
	They had no idea Greece was so large.
	你让我们没完没了地行军 他们已经受不了了\N

	所以当我们两支军队到达希腊时 他们就麻烦了\N
	So when both our armies arrive in Greece they will be trapped.
	而且他们也没有时间逃跑\N
	And there will be no time for them to flee.
	你懂我在说什么吗？要不我讲慢点\N
	Do you understand what I'm saying, or shall I speak more slowly?

	我不喜欢那个女孩 她对人有坏影响\N
	I don't like the girl. She's a bad influence.
	这不是游戏 妈妈\N
	This is not a game, Mother.
	她的父亲可是个“巨富”\N
	Her father is immensely rich.
	的确 采石场\N
	True. Stone quarries.
	那么为鲁弗斯·特兰克维鲁斯默哀吧\N

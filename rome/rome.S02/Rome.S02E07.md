	- What shall we do? - Atia of the Julii, I call for justice.
	不怎么办 什么都不做\N
	Nothing. Nothing at all.
	只要我们无视她 她很快就走了\N
	She'll go away soon enough if we just ignore her.
	嗨 老婆\N

	我们别无选择 只能动用奥斯提亚里面的船坞\N

	我们现有的谷物船 货运量已经超过10000罐了\N

	伯斯卡昨天结婚\N
	Posca's wedding yesterday.
	我恐怕是喝多了\N
	I'm afraid I drank rather too much.
	我没办法起床 不管怎么样都不行\N
	I could not get out of bed, no matter how hard I tried.
	我头疼得要命\N
	I have the most shocking headache.
	所以你们俩得小声说话\N
	So you must both speak very quietly
	不然我的头就要炸成碎片了\N
	or I shall shatter into a thousand little pieces.
	一些…元老院的大人物 来找过我\N
	I've been approached by a number of eminent friends among the Senate.
	他们有点担心\N
	They are troubled.
	我倒不认为他们的忧虑 是必要的…\N
	I do not say that they have grounds for anxiety,
	不过我要不跟你们说一声的话 就是我的失职\N
	but I feel I would be remiss if I did not communicate...
	- 你就直说吧 - 好的 好的\N
	- Do get on with it, man. - Yes, yes.
	他们担心我们三个可能打算…\N
	They're worried that perhaps we three intend
	搞某种形式的…\N
	to establish some form of...
	暴政\N
	tyranny.
	是谁这么忧心忡忡？\N
	And who are these worriers?
	- 把名字给我 - 这可有点为难\N
	- Give me names. - That's awkward.
	他们是私下跟我说的\N
	They spoke to me in confidence.
	那是当然的\N
	I'll bet they did.
	你去告诉你那些尊贵的朋友 闭上他们的嘴\N
	You tell your eminent friends to shut their mouths.
	让他们去看看讲坛前西赛罗的手\N
	Tell them to go look on Cicero's hands in the Forum
	搞清楚那些乱嚷嚷暴政的人\N
	and remember what happens
	会有什么下场\N
	to those that prattle of tyranny.
	我提出来 是怕你们 认为我有所隐瞒\N
	I only mention it. I would be remiss if I did not.
	你是对的 莱彼德斯\N
	You're quite right, Lepidus.
	你是对的\N
	Quite right.
	现在我们可以开始谈正事了吗？\N
	Now, shall we get down to business?
	好的 该干嘛干嘛\N
	Yes, by all means.
	很明显我们三个不能同时统治罗马\N
	Clearly, we three cannot all rule together at once.
	彼此之间只会产生困惑和争执\N
	We shall confuse and contradict each other.
	- 这倒是实话 - 我们必须分担职责\N
	- True enough. - We must divide responsibilities.
	你有什么建议？\N
	What are you proposing?
	我建议我们把罗马的领土一分为三\N
	I suggest we divide the territory of Rome into three.
	每个人统治其中一块领地\N
	Each one of us shall assume command of one region.
	听起来很合理\N
	Sounds reasonable.
	可是要怎么分？\N
	Who gets what?
	我还没考虑到这一点\N
	I haven't considered that yet.
	不过罗马的核心组织错综复杂\N
	But Rome is a very complex machine.
	哪像切菜那么简单\N
	One can't simply chop it up like cabbage.
	罗马应该归你 还有西域\N
	You should have Rome and the west.
	我要的是… 埃及和东部的行省\N
	And I will make do with Egypt and the eastern provinces.
	- 如何？- 罗马和西域有什么？\N
	- Objections? - Rome and the west has what?
	好斗的高卢人 还有日耳曼人 一个难伺候的元老院\N
	Rowdy Gauls, Germans, a fractious Senate,
	还有整治黑帮的烂摊子\N
	all the trouble of keeping the Roman mob happy.
	东方才是聚宝盆\N
	The east is where the money is,
	粮食收成和税收的主要来源\N
	the grain supply, most of the tax revenue.
	所有的税收都应该平均分配\N
	Well, all the revenues would be divided equally, of course.
	这只是单纯的行政分管\N
	It would be a purely administrative division.
	所有的钱都统一收归国库\N
	All monies would be held in a single treasury.
	- 这样还行 - 那我呢？\N
	- That would work. - And I?
	我有什么？\N
	What would I get?
	是啊\N
	Yes.
	非洲\N

	It wasn't me who killed her precious son.
	- 她应该在你家门外哭 - 她只不过想引人注意\N

	走出去 让她对你咆哮一阵\N
	Go out. Let her rant at you a while.
	那她很快就会走了\N

	在一群眉来眼去的下等人面前 接受她的诅咒？我才不要\N

	我才不会让她称心如意呢\N
	Never. I wouldn't give her that pleasure.
	随便你\N

	我敢说你根本就 不住艾文台山 是吧？\N
	I bet you don't even live on the Aventine.
	不是假的 是真的 我对着神圣的黑石向你起誓\N
	No fake. I swear to you by the sacred black stone.
	滚出去 别让我在这附近再抓到你\N
	Get out and don't let me catch you around here again.

	- 我想是莫密欧 - 很有可能\N
	- Memmio, I expect. - Very likely.
	- 我们该怎么做？- 什么也不做\N
	- What do we do? - Nothing.
	这我就不懂了\N
	Lost me there.
	莫密欧的确是又贪又不忠实\N
	Memmio is dishonest and greedy.
	我们怎么也没办法改变这个事实\N
	Nothing we can do can change that.
	如果他认为他能瞒过我们 随他高兴好了\N
	If he thinks he's deceiving us, then he's happy.
	我希望每个人都高兴\N
	And I want everyone to be happy.
	这就是我们的和平之道 无为而治\N

	- Calm down. Beat who? - That whore, that Gaia.
	- 去揍死她 - 她又干什么了？\N
	- You beat her dead! - What's she done now?
	她不肯照我说的搬来柴火 然后她说要把木棒塞进我喉咙里\N
	She wouldn't bring in wood like I tell her. Then she say she'll choke me with a stick.
	- 什么？- 她说要把木棒塞进我喉咙里\N
	- What? - She say she's gonna choke me with a stick.
	我不明白了 她为什么要这么做？你对她做了什么？\N
	I don't understand. Why would she do that? What did you do to her?
	哦 好极了 现在又成我的错了？\N
	Perfect. Now it's my fault?
	- 谢谢你 十分感谢 - 艾瑞纳\N
	- Thank you. Thank you very much. - Eirene.
	该死\N
	Oh, cack.
	我该怎么做？\N
	What do I do?
	- 别看我 - 好笑是吗？\N
	- Don't look at me. - Very funny.
	如果我去给盖娅应得的教训 你说马修斯会怎么想？\N
	If I go and beat Gaia like she deserves, what do you think Mascius will do?
	- 她是他的女人 对吧？- 这可是一团乱麻\N
	- She's his girl. - It's a puzzle, all right.
	马修斯去哪了？我该跟他用男人方式打招呼 他能自己去惩罚她\N
	Where's Mascius? Maybe if I go and talk to him man to man, he can chastise her.
	他在奥斯提亚 下个月才回\N
	He's in Ostia.
	- 新谷物船的事儿 - 该死\N
	- The new grain-ship business. - Oh, cack.
	也许你可以去揍她一顿\N
	Maybe if you were to give her the beating...
	如果你愿意的话我就去\N
	I will if you want.
	不 是我的老婆被人侮辱 这是我的事儿\N

	What? You're gonna whip me?
	是的\N
	I am.
	你为什么要这么做？\N
	Why would you want to do that?
	你心里清楚得很\N
	You know damn well why.
	- 你说说看 - 你不尊敬我妻子\N
	- Tell me. - You disrespected my wife.
	哦 那个啊 她想打我\N
	Oh, that. She tried to hit me.
	她是这间屋子的女主人 你只是个该死的奴隶\N
	She's lady of this house. You're a slave! She's allowed to hit you.
	她有权打你 现在过来 让我们把这事儿了了\N
	Now let's get it done.
	只不过有点叫人难以想象 是她嫁给了老板\N
	It's hard to remember she's married to the boss.
	我是说不是针对她个人的 只是觉得有点不太合常理\N
	I mean, nothing against her. It's just not natural.
	她是个胆小如鼠的女人\N
	She's such a mouse of a woman.
	你却是男人中的雄狮\N
	You're such a lion of a man.
	胡扯 你根本不了解我们的事\N

	你希望我是什么动物？\N
	What kind of animal do you want me to be?
	会弯下腰去 毫无怨言地被鞭打的那种\N
	The kind that will bend over and take her whipping without complaint.
	我可以为你做到\N
	I could do that for you.
	但是你先得对我好一点\N
	But you've got to treat me nice first.
	给我闭嘴 知道了吗？闭嘴 过来\N
	Just shut it, all right? Just shut it and come here.
	你觉得马修斯发现你打了我 之后会干什么\N
	What will Mascius do if you beat me?
	我才不在乎马修斯会干什么\N
	I don't give a fuck. Mascius will do what I tell him.
	马修斯听我的 不 马修斯听我的\N
	No, Mascius does what I tell him.
	哦 真的？\N
	Oh, yeah?
	那他就更是个蠢货了\N
	More fool him, then.
	操你妈\N
	Fuck you!

	You and me go nicely together, don't you think?
	你跟我什么事也没有\N
	You and me are nothing.
	可要是我下次再不乖呢？\N
	But what if I misbehave again?
	你会好好"教训"我的 对吧\N
	You gotta keep me disciplined, haven't you?
	别试探我 女人\N
	Don't test me, girl.
	我警告你\N

	人们必须献上贿赂当作礼物 这是真的吗？\N
	One must offer the bribe as a gift. Is that so?

	还有边防抵御 帕提亚人的事宜\N

	人渣\N

	杂种 人渣\N
	Bastard scum!
	当街咒骂他有什么好处？\N

	真幼稚 只会自找麻烦\N
	It's childish. You'll only get into trouble.
	我告诉你 他比他父亲还要坏\N
	He's worse than his father.
	不把人民变成奴隶和拜偶像者之前 他是不会善罢甘休的\N
	He'll make our people slaves and idolaters.
	他真该死 杂种 去死吧\N
	He should die. The bastard should die!
	那无疑是为民除害了\N
	Well, it would be a mitzvah, no doubt.
	我说真的\N
	I'm serious.
	拜托 就凭我们俩？\N
	Come on. Us?
	除了我们 还有谁\N
	If not us, then who?
	我们和希律身处一处\N
	Herod is here. We are here.
	人民的未来掌握在你我手中\N
	The future of our people is in our hands.
	你好 米西纳斯\N
	Salve, Maecenas.
	你好 伯斯卡\N
	Hello, Posca.
	能谈一下吗？\N
	Might I have a word?
	如果你坚持的话\N
	I suppose, if you must.
	在我印象里你是那种\N
	It strikes me you're the sort of man
	懂得如何保守秘密的人\N
	that knows how to keep a confidence.
	是的\N
	Yes.
	如果有人告诉你一个…秘密\N
	If a man were to tell you something in confidence,
	你也许会把它告诉给其他人… 但不会透漏其来源 对吗\N
	you might tell others, but you would not reveal your source.
	不会\N
	No.
	多半你也是那种 会给告密者…\N
	And perhaps you're the sort of man that knows how to properly...
	适当的酬劳…\N
	reward...
	对吗\N
	those who confide in him.
	你很了解我\N
	You have me exactly.
	你也很会看人\N
	You're a fine judge of character.
	你买来的狮子毫无用处\N
	Those lions you bought me were useless.
	对拉车一窍不通 还把一个好马夫的手臂给生扯下来\N
	Wouldn't pull my chariot for shit and bit the arm off a perfectly good groom.
	畜生通常喜怒无常\N
	They are temperamental animals.
	很幸运 我刚抓到一头长颈鹿\N
	I am very fortunate to have a giraffe,
	您是否感兴趣？\N
	should you be interested.
	我要长颈鹿做什么\N
	What would I do with a giraffe?
	骆驼 如何？\N
	Camels, perhaps?
	骆驼？你以为我卖枣子的吗？\N
	Camels? Do I look like a fucking date merchant?
	要能跑的狮子\N
	Lions that run!
	滚出去\N
	Get out.
	有什么新闻吗 年轻的凯撒\N
	Now, what news, young Caesar?
	20 000的三分之一有多少\N
	What is one-third of 20,000?
	6666左右\N
	6,666 or thereabouts.
	你当我是傻子吗？\N
	Do you take me for a fool?
	一个接一个 毫无根据的问题\N
	Question after question.
	让我很难回答你\N
	Makes for very poor conversation.
	受到什么委屈 说出来就是\N
	If you have a grievance, just say what it is.
	我们曾经有个协定\N
	We had an agreement.
	- 平分所有国家收入 - 是的\N
	- We would share all revenue. - Yes.
	希律答应给你 20 000磅金子\N
	Herod has agreed to give you 20,000 pounds of gold.
	我要我的那部分\N
	I want my share.
	谁告诉你这些的？\N
	Who told you this?
	你不承认？\N
	You deny?
	- 谁告诉他的 - 我收买了希律的手下\N
	- Who told him? - I've bought one of Herod's people.
	你还要否认吗？\N
	Do you deny it?
	既然希律如此慷慨的送我一份大礼\N
	If Herod is kind enough to give me a gift,
	和你们有什么关系？\N
	what business is it of yours?
	礼物不属于国家收入吧\N
	A gift is not revenue.
	那不是礼物 是贿赂 作为政治和军事上的照顾\N
	It is not a gift. It is a bribe for political and military favors,
	这些照顾却要国家来承担\N
	the cost of which favors shall be borne by the state.
	- 迂腐 - 面对现实吧\N
	- Pedantry. - Let us be realistic.
	这份协定将会失效…\N
	This arrangement of ours cannot work
	如果你总是借机…\N
	if you seek every opportunity
	背着我中饱私囊的话\N
	to aggrandize yourself at my expense.
	中饱私囊？\N
	Aggrandize myself?
	说这话的人 还把自己"所谓的"父亲\N
	This from the boy who... whose so-called father
	称之为神\N
	has been declared a god.
	这头衔他受之无愧\N
	An honor he well deserves.
	这么说是因为你 想让别人把你当作神的儿子\N
	You only did it so that you might be known as the son of a god.
	你没有一点自己的功绩\N
	You have no accomplishments of your own,
	就借别人的光\N
	so you seek to borrow the glory of others.
	是的 在穆提那打败你… 算不得什么功绩\N
	It's true. It was no accomplishment to defeat you at Mutina.
	你战胜我？\N
	You defeated me?
	你这个懦夫犊子\N
	You cowardly little shit!
	他连帐篷都没搭过\N
	He'd never even left his tent.
	你自始自终都没战胜过我\N
	You have never defeated me in anything.
	先生们 不要激动\N
	Gentlemen, gentlemen, let's not get overheated.
	我们一定能够达成某种合理的协议\N
	I'm sure we can come to some kind of reasonable agreement.
	我以为你会吸取教训… 学会谦卑与自律\N
	I had hoped you might have learned some humility and discipline.
	照今日看 你仍然是… 粗鲁 傲慢的好色之徒\N
	I see now that you are still the same crude, arrogant lech
	本性难改\N
	you always were.
	没错 还是老样子\N
	That's right, just the same.
	还在操你母亲\N
	And still fucking your mother!
	你没事吧？\N
	Are you all right?
	是的 没事\N
	Yes, nothing.
	- 要不躺下歇会？- 不 没事\N
	- Do you want to go lie down? - No, it's fine.
	还需要什么吗 女主人\N
	Anything else, Mistress?
	水\N
	Water.
	主人呢？\N
	Master?
	不 什么都不要\N
	No. Nothing.
	看见没？现在变成好奴才了\N
	See? Good slave now,
	自从你给她一顿揍之后\N
	ever since you gave her a good beating.
	你说的没错\N
	There you go.
	你该每个月都赏她一顿\N
	You should beat her the same way every month.
	如果她在我回来前醒来 告诉她我去了莱蒂的神殿\N
	If she wakes before I'm back, tell her I've gone to Lyde's temple.
	再和我讲讲那个农场 都会买些什么牲畜\N
	Tell me again about the farm. What kind of animals will we have?
	绵羊\N
	Sheep,
	山羊\N
	goats,

	Yes, horses as well. Elephants, if you like.
	- 冥神之子 请你… - 怎么了？\N
	- Sons of Dis, will you... - What's the matter?
	对不起 不是说你 只是…\N
	I'm sorry. It's not you, it's...
	生意上的问题\N
	It's business matters...
	别管了\N
	Forget it.

	It's just a girl. I'll see you outside.
	- 这是卢西尔斯·乌瑞纳斯的女儿 - 不 不是的\N
	- That's the daughter of Lucius Vorenus. - No, it's not.
	少糊弄我 难道是我眼瞎了？\N
	Don't fuck me about. I've got eyes, haven't I?
	你们在一起多久？\N
	How long's this been going on?
	几个月\N
	A few months.
	你傻吗 姑娘 你不知道这样 对你父亲是多么不敬吗？\N
	Are you insane? You know what disrespect this shows your father?
	- 我不在乎 我恨他 - 不过如果他查到 你知道什么后果\N
	- I don't care. I hate him. - But think what will happen if he finds out.
	只要我在他面前百依百顺 他会觉得诸事顺利\N
	If I smile at him and serve his damn soup like a good daughter, he thinks it's fine.
	- 他是不会发现的 - 他不会吗？\N
	- He won't find out. - Will he not?
	我们是结盟立誓的教友 我要对他以诚相待 我得告诉他\N
	Him and me are friends by oath. It is my duty to be honest with him. I'll have to tell him.
	- 不能 你不能告诉他  - 对不起 孩子\N
	- You can't. You can't tell him! - Sorry, love, but if I don't tell him
	如果我不告诉他 我不就是和你们同流合污？\N
	I'm just as guilty as you two, aren't I?
	如果他从其它途径得知此事 他决不会相信…\N
	And what if he finds out? He'll never believe I didn't know.
	他宝贵的女儿与我手下有一腿 而我却一无所知\N
	His precious daughter and one of my men.
	他会把我给生吞了\N
	He'll have my guts!
	真是乱七八糟\N
	This is a right fucking mess.
	求你了 先生 别告诉他\N
	Please, sir, don't tell him.
	他会杀了她的\N
	He'll kill her.
	不 我想他还不至于如此\N
	No, he won't go that far, I shouldn't think.
	会的 你了解他的\N

	他是个畜生 杀了我母亲 也会杀我\N
	He's an animal. He killed my mother. He'll kill me.

	But what am I to do? You've put me in an impossible position here.

	没其他事的话 我还有公务要办\N
	If we're all done, I have work to do.
	你没意识到你俩的争吵 会让城内人心惶惶？\N
	You do realize your two bickering has put the whole city in a panic?
	我会让新闻官去宣布\N
	I'll have the newsreader say something,
	"重建友好盟约"之类的\N
	"Renewed vows of amity" and so forth.
	没人会相信新闻官说所的\N
	No one believes what the newsreader says.
	你有更好的建议吗？\N

	I do.
	如果我们两家能喜结连理\N
	If a marriage was to happen between our two houses,
	人民就不会再有疑虑了\N
	no one could doubt all was well.
	就算意大利化成了灰…\N
	Well, I don't care if all Italy burns,
	我也不要嫁给这小子\N
	I'll not marry him.
	主意不错\N
	It's not a bad idea.
	是表达团结的最有力方式\N
	It would be a strong expression of unity.

	And the plebs love a good wedding.
	我没理由拒绝\N
	I have no objection.
	谢谢 谅你也不敢\N
	Thank you. I should think not.

	We could do it after Lupercalia. It's very auspicious.
	怎么了？\N
	What?
	如果我们要讨论政治联姻 妇女就该退下\N

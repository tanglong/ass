	Taste like pork if you cook 'em right. All gone.
	啊 难怪我说晚上怎么能那么安宁\N
	I wondered why the nights were so peaceful.
	- 没有犬吠声 - 现在不是开玩笑的时候\N
	- No barking. - This is no moment for wit.
	我希望我能做些什么\N
	I wish there were something I could do.
	但是国家粮仓跟 你们的一样几近空虚\N
	But the state granaries are near as empty as yours.
	除非我从别人那儿抢来给你\N
	I can only give to you by taking from someone else.
	- 军库还没开封 - 军队也需要粮食维持\N

	让李必达养他们\N
	Let Lepidus feed them.
	这样一来 就能保证 城市里一个月的用粮\N
	That would supply the city with enough grain for a month.
	就这样办\N
	Have it done.
	这只是暂时的解决办法 我们已尽了最大努力\N
	It's only a temporary solution, but it's the best we can offer.

	他想要激怒人民起来推翻我\N

	如果他想开战 为什么不满足他\N
	If he wants a war, why not give it to him?
	哼 你听到波罗说了\N
	You heard Pullo.
	那等于是向美酒和歌舞宣战\N
	You might as well declare war on wine and song.
	不 不 不\N
	No, no, no, no.
	与安东尼一战在所难免 除非人民站在我们这一边\N
	War on Antony is doomed unless the people are with us.

	她根本不听我的话\N
	She doesn't listen to a word I say.

	You're wrong.
	恕我直言 可是…\N
	Sorry to be blunt, but...
	你不认为该面对现实了吗\N
	Well, don't you think it's time to face facts?
	安东尼答应他会来接我 他就一定会来\N
	Antony promised to send for me and he will.
	就算他来了 你以为 屋大维会放你走？\N
	Even if he did, do you think Octavian would let you go?
	我才不管他\N
	I don't give a fig.
	说真的 他值得你这样折磨自己吗\N
	Truly, is he worth torturing yourself like this?

	你在开玩笑\N
	You are joking?
	我都不记得我上次开玩笑是在什么时候了\N
	I cannot remember the last time I made a joke.
	上次市集日\N
	Last market day.
	你说了鱼什么的 我笑得肚子疼\N
	You said something about fishes which made me laugh quite distinctly.
	我是在打比方\N
	I was speaking figuratively.
	如果你认真的 去的应该是母亲而不是我 她才是他真正的妻子\N
	If you are serious, it is not I should go, but Mother. She's his real wife.
	我想你也一起去\N
	I thought you might go together.
	亲自向安东尼证实\N
	Present Antony with both reality and appearance.
	那很好 可是…\N
	That's all very well, but...
	我不想坐船千里迢迢地去找他\N
	I have no desire to take a long sea voyage.
	- 你觉得呢 - 我也不想\N

	再说了 我们又不饿\N

	你知道安东尼一定 会拒绝她们的要求\N
	You know Antony will refuse what they ask.
	很有可能\N
	It's very likely.
	怎么\N
	What?
	你算计着… 如果安东尼拒绝屋达维娅\N
	You calculate... that if Antony turns Octavia away,
	人们会认为他公然 侮辱了他亲爱的妻子\N
	the people will feel that he has publicly humiliated his darling wife,
	克娄巴特拉女王迷惑了他\N
	that Queen Cleopatra has bewitched him,
	他们会开始反对他\N
	and they will all turn against him.
	差不多\N
	Something like that.
	另一种可能是\N
	But on the other hand,
	如果安东尼还爱着阿提娅 屈服与她的请求\N
	if Antony still loves Atia and yields to her pleading,
	那就更好了\N
	then... so much the better.
	你会得到你想要的粮食\N

	Yeah, well, that would be right.
	有人比我更了解他\N

	- 他们在哪儿 - 怎么了\N

	that is exactly what he wants.
	他强迫我做一个公开的选择\N
	He is forcing me to choose publicly
	在她...和你之间的\N

	he will have his premise for war.
	那又怎样？\N

	he is striking
	取代我的影响力\N
	at my support amongst the people.
	他...他会认为 他从策略上战胜了我\N

	Why should she not know it?
	这是一个善举\N
	It's an act of kindness.
	让她不再对你朝思暮想\N
	Stop her pining for you.
	我没说错啊 你不再爱她了\N
	I'm not wrong, am I? You do no longer love her.
	当然 我不再爱她了\N
	Of course I no longer love her.
	你知道我不再爱她了\N
	And you know I no longer love her.
	但她也不该受到当众羞辱\N
	But neither do I think she deserves public humiliation.
	这就是重点\N
	That is the whole point.
	这就是为什么他们来这儿 为了被羞辱\N
	That is why they're here, to be humiliated.
	不 我认为她不知道\N
	No, I don't think she knows that.

	太棒了\N
	It's perfect.
	不 我的人会把我当成弑妻者 而看低我\N

	那他们的船就会驶回去了\N
	Well, their ship sank on the way home.

	哦 你...\N
	Oh, you...
	天哪 真是个可怕的地方\N
	Gods, what a ghastly place.
	很大 但\N
	Big, though.
	很粗俗\N
	It's a sure sign of vulgarity.
	托勒密原来是牧羊的 你知道吗\N
	Ptolemies were originally goatherds, you know?
	为什么这些门不开\N
	Why are the doors not open?
	够了\N
	Enough!

	真可恶\N
	This is outrageous.
	无礼\N
	The rudeness.
	粗俗\N

	太热了\N
	This heat's unbearable.
	我想我快晕了\N
	I think I'm going to faint.
	你想让他们给我拿点水来\N
	You would think they would bring us water.
	- 为什么不回到船里去 - 当然不行\N
	- Can't we go back to the ship? - Absolutely not.
	我就一直在这等着 直到那些恶心的人出来\N
	We're staying here until these wretched people...
	该死的\N
	Oh, and about bloody time.
	你好\N
	Hello.
	伊俄卡斯特 是你吗\N
	Jocasta. Is it you?
	当然是我 不然是谁呢\N
	Of course it's me. Who else would I be?
	你怎么了 这个吗\N
	What's happened to you?
	女王不喜欢罗马女人的装扮\N
	This? Her Majesty doesn't like the Roman style on her women.
	如果你问我的话 我是有点失去理智了\N
	Quite irrational about the subject if you ask me.
	但都是为了能过太平日子啊 我还挺喜欢现在这个样子\N
	But anything for a quiet life. I rather like it now.
	你来这儿干嘛？过这"假惺惺"的日子？\N
	What are you doing here? Have you come for Crocodile Day?
	我是这么叫它的 我不会说方言\N
	That's what I call it, anyway. I can't get my mouth round their lingo.
	她会大叫\N
	She will shriek.
	而我呢 就假装有点不正常 她就会让我走了\N
	But I just pretend I'm a little mad, and she leaves off.
	为什么门是关着的 为什么没人出来迎接我们\N
	Why is the door kept shut? Why is there no one here to greet us?
	我想一会就会有人来了\N
	Oh, I'm sure there'll be someone along in a while.
	世事变迁...这里变动不大 高温\N
	Things move... ever so slow around here. It's the heat.
	听着 你为什么不进去 告诉安东尼我们在等着见他？\N
	Listen, why don't you go inside and tell Antony that we're waiting to see him?
	很显然 他不知道我们在这儿\N
	Obviously, he's not been informed that we're here.
	我不能这样做\N
	I couldn't do that.
	不经她同意 任何人不得见安东尼\N
	No one's allowed to speak to Antony without she says so.
	除了我的波士卡\N
	Except my dear little Posca.
	当然还有卢修斯 乌利纳斯\N
	And Lucius Vorenus, of course.
	我喜欢你这样的头发\N
	I love your hair like that.
	现在人们都像这样吗\N
	Is that how people are wearing it now?
	谢天谢地 波士卡\N
	Thank Juno. Posca.
	- 她叫什么名字？- 伊俄卡斯特 你在干什么？\N
	- What in heaven's name is... - Jocasta, what are you doing?
	- 我只是… - 安静点\N
	- I was only... - Quiet, woman!
	波士卡 安东尼在哪\N
	Posca, where's Antony?
	是 是 很乐意效劳\N
	Yes, yes! A great pleasure.
	真的 走\N
	Indeed, yes. Come along.
	波士卡？波士卡？\N
	Posca? Posca?
	谢谢\N
	Thank you.
	他们都疯了\N
	They've all gone insane, obviously.
	太热了\N
	So hot.
	你知道的 这是为以后能更好\N
	It's for the best, you know.
	这样的宫廷生活对你不利\N
	This palace life is no good for you.
	你要有所行动\N
	You need action.
	是\N
	Yeah.
	当战争打起时 你会愈加开心\N
	You'll be much more happy when the war begins.
	- 乌利纳斯 - 头\N
	- Vorenus. - Sir?
	我给你个特别任务\N
	I have a delicate mission for you.
	我很开心看到至少你还没有回归自然\N
	I'm glad to see you haven't gone native, at least.
	也许你能讲出点道理来\N
	Perhaps you can talk some sense.
	这些人都怎么了\N
	What is the matter with these people?
	为什么没告诉安东尼我们来了\N
	Why hasn't Antony been told of our arrival?
	我由三人执政官之一马克.安东尼授权 护送你们回到船里\N
	I've been ordered by Triumvir Mark Antony to escort you both back to your ship,
	确认你们在风力允许的时候离开亚历山大\N
	and to make sure that you leave Alexandria as soon as the wind allows.
	都见不着他？\N
	Without seeing him?
	他撵走他孩子的母亲？\N
	He turns away the mother of his child?
	是的\N
	That's correct.
	是不是她让你这么做的？\N
	It was she who ordered you to do this, wasn't it?
	安东尼不会这么慢的\N
	Antony wouldn't act so low.
	我只是服从马克.安东尼的命令 女士\N
	I take orders only from Mark Antony, madam.
	不 我们不走\N
	No, we're not going.
	- 妈妈 我... - 女士？\N
	- Mother, I... - Madam...
	我们不走\N
	We are not going.
	我不会离开这里\N
	I am not moving from this spot
	除非安东尼他自己出来让我走\N
	unless Antony comes down himself and tells me to go.
	如果你不愿意走的话 我已经被授权\N
	If you will not go willingly, I have been given orders
	可采取任何必须手段让你们离开\N
	to use whatever force necessary to remove you.
	你将肆意粗暴对待朱利家的女人吗？\N
	You would manhandle the women of the Julii?
	不 但这儿的男人们\N
	No, but these men here...
	他们不会有如此顾忌\N
	they have no such scruples.
	- 安东尼 - 女士\N
	- Antony! - Madam.
	滚开 狗娘养的\N
	Come down, you bastard!
	女士 请吧\N
	Madam, please!
	你告诉我丈夫他是个废物人渣\N
	You tell my husband that he's cowardly scum.
	告诉他这些\N
	Tell him that.
	你了解的 显然 我们将失去所有的财产？\N
	You realize, of course, we'll have to leave all our money behind.
	- 我不在乎 - 我们将身无分文\N
	- I don't care! - We're penniless.
	我害怕 我想回家 快点\N
	I'm scared. I want to go home. Please, hurry.
	- 去哪儿？- 没有啊\N
	- Going somewhere? - No.
	不去哪 你怎么会这么认为？\N
	No. What makes you think that?
	求你了乌利纳斯.\N
	Please, Vorenus.
	别说出去 求你别说出去\N
	Don't tell. Please don't tell.
	对我们发发慈悲吧\N
	Have mercy on us.
	他们会杀了我们的 会把我们扔去喂鳄鱼\N
	They'll kill us. They'll throw us to the crocodiles.
	我妻子太紧张了\N
	My wife is overwrought.
	我们只是要去海港上闲逛\N
	We were merely going to take a stroll along the harbor
	去看看船\N
	to look at the ships.
	那么你们得快点了\N
	Then you must hurry.
	风向要变了 帆竖起来时看着还不错\N
	The wind is changing. The ships look best when the sails are set.
	和我们一起吧\N
	Come with us.
	- 不 - 战争就要打起来了\N
	- No. - War is sure to come now.
	这里不适合正派的罗马人待\N
	This is no place for decent Romans.
	是的 但我有责任\N
	True, but I have responsibilities here.
	时间到了\N
	Now is the time.
	如果你碰到提图斯.波罗\N
	If you happen to see Titus Pullo,
	让他帮我亲吻我的孩子们\N
	ask him to kiss my children for me.
	我会的\N
	I will do that.
	谢谢\N
	Thank you.
	你好 又见面了\N
	Hello again.
	很抱歉麻烦你们了\N
	Sorry to trouble you.
	你们介意我们藏在这里吗？\N
	Would you mind awfully if we hide here
	一直等到船驶入大海？\N
	until this boat is at sea?
	我记得的都告诉你了\N
	I've told you everything I remember.
	一定还有一些\N
	There must be more than that.
	看看你自己\N
	Look to yourself.
	你能使他记起一些事情\N
	You are what remains of him.
	乌利纳斯\N
	Vorenus.
	怎么样？\N
	Well?
	他们走了\N
	They're gone.
	好\N
	Good.
	好\N
	Good.
	阿提亚怎么样？\N
	And how was... Atia?
	我猜想她还是一贯的镇静吧？\N
	I suppose she took it with her usual poise?
	- 不是 - 不是？\N
	- No. - No?
	已经办好了\N
	Well. Had to be done.
	波士卡在哪 我叫他但他没来\N
	Where's Posca? I sent for him but he did not come.
	我不清楚 长官 你要我去看看吗\N
	I don't know, sir. Do you wish me to go and look for him?
	不 不\N
	Oh, no, no.
	就这样吧\N
	It's all right.
	我相信他会露面的\N
	I'm sure he'll turn up.
	长官 你妻子让我转告你一些话\N
	Sir, your wife instructed me to tell you something.
	她让我转告你 说你是个废物人渣\N
	She instructed me to tell you that you are cowardly scum.
	她这样说了？\N
	She did, did she?
	那… 你怎么看呢？\N
	And... and what's your opinion of that?
	这不是我能发表意见的话题 长官\N
	It's not my place to have an opinion, sir.
	说吧\N
	Nah. Tell me anyway.
	那是命令吗？\N
	Is that an order?
	是的 一个命令\N
	Yes. That's an order.
	你不是废物\N
	You're no coward.
	但你灵魂患了很严重的疾病\N
	But you do have a strong disease in your soul.
	它会吞噬你...\N
	A disease that will eat away at you...
	直到你死去\N
	until you die.
	真的？\N
	Really?
	是什么病？\N
	And what is this disease?
	我不知道 我又不是医生\N
	I don't know. I'm not a doctor.
	是啊\N
	No.
	是啊 你不是医生\N
	No, you're not.
	那你怎么能下如此诊断？\N
	So how can you be so sure of your diagnosis, then?
	我了解你的症状\N
	I recognize your symptoms.
	我也患了同样的病\N
	I have the same sickness.
	来个远投\N
	Long one.
	你好 妈妈 还有波士卡\N
	Hello, Mother.
	这个惊喜太让我高兴了\N
	And Posca. What a pleasant surprise.
	我召集了没被安东尼说服的人\N
	I gather Antony was not amenable to persuasion.
	不 他不会\N
	No, he was not.
	但你是知道的 不是吗\N
	But you knew that, didn't you?
	你想得到卡普里的一所别墅\N
	You wanted a villa in Capri.
	现在你能拥有了\N
	Now you may have one.
	屋达维娅还好吗？\N
	Is Octavia well?
	波士卡来这儿\N
	Posca has something here
	将帮你摧毁安东尼\N
	that will help you destroy Antony.
	- 妈妈 我希望… - 打倒安东尼和他的女王\N
	- Mother, I am hoping... - Crush Antony and his queen.
	你留着那该死的别墅吧\N
	And you can keep your damn villa.
	你有什么要给我的 波士卡？\N
	You have something for me, Posca?
	这是安东尼和克娄巴特拉\N
	It is the last will and testament
	最后意愿和遗嘱\N
	of Antony and Cleopatra.
	只会在他们死的时候才会公开和公布\N
	To be opened and read only on the occasion of their death.
	这是个可鄙的文件\N
	It is a despicable document.
	再加上他对你姐姐的批判\N
	Taken together with his repudiation of your sister,
	罗马人民一定会认为这次反安东尼的战争 虽然是不可避免的\N
	the Roman people would think a war against Antony not only inevitable,
	但是是非常合理的\N
	but eminently desirable.
	- 是真的吗 - 是真的\N
	- Is it genuine? - It is genuine.
	你是一个忠诚的好朋友 波士卡\N
	You are a good and loyal friend, Posca.
	这个已经能让他自我毁灭了\N
	This one's cooked himself for dinner.
	他说要死后要埋在亚历山大\N
	He asks to be buried in Alexandria.
	他宣布克娄巴特拉为他的妻子 他们已经住在一起了\N
	He declares Cleopatra his wife and that they are living gods.
	她是伊希斯女神 而他是奥斯里斯神\N
	She is Isis and he, Osiris.
	- 太棒了 - 等等 还有更好的\N
	- It's perfect. - Wait, wait. It's better.
	他留给他和克娄巴特拉的孩子 整个东部省\N
	He leaves to his children by Cleopatra all the eastern provinces.
	克娄巴特拉和恺撒的儿子\N
	And her son by Caesar is to be given Rome and the west.
	
	[罗马和西部]
	已经抛弃了他亲爱的妻子 屋达维娅\N
	Having rejected his loving wife Octavia,
	马克.安东尼\N
	Mark Antony has coupled himself
	和那个女巫沆瀣一气\N
	to the sorceress Cleopatra,
	让她得到整个罗马的所有权\N
	promising her dominion of all Rome!
	他现在崇拜的是走狗和爬虫一类 卑鄙的人\N
	He worships dogs and reptiles.
	他的眼睛被烟灰熏黑了\N
	He blackens his eyes with soot
	像妓女一类的\N
	like a prostitute.
	他已经习惯低俗的尼罗河习俗\N
	He dances and plays the cymbals
	跳着舞还敲着钹\N
	in vile Nilotic rites.
	我知道你们有多么不开心 我也不会责怪你们\N
	I know how unhappy you are and I cannot blame you.
	当听说伟大的马克.安东尼 已经敬仰外来神\N
	For who would not weep when he hears
	抛妻弃子\N
	that the great Mark Antony pays homage to foreign gods?
	以及他的祖国\N
	That he has abandoned his wife,
	有谁能不伤心呢？\N
	his child and his country?
	有人问我是不是疯了 被魔法蛊惑\N
	I am asked if he is gone mad, if he is bewitched.
	我无法回答\N
	I have no explanation.
	我们可以为他哭泣 但也必须担起我们的责任\N
	We may weep for him, but then we must do our duty,
	因为他不再是一个罗马人 而是一个埃及人\N
	for he is no longer a Roman, but an Egyptian.
	除了战争我们还能做什么？\N
	And what is left for us to do but fight him?
	与他作战 毁灭他\N
	Fight him and destroy him!
	波罗 老朋友 真高兴看到你\N
	Pullo. My old friend, it's good to see you.
	- 长官 - 过来 坐\N
	- Sir. - Come, sit down.
	波士卡告诉我你的朋友乌利纳斯 甚至到现在还站在安东尼那边\N
	Posca tells me our friend Vorenus stands by Antony even now.
	忠心的乌利纳斯\N
	Loyal man, Vorenus.
	他让我问候你\N
	He sends you his best regards,
	请你为他亲吻他的孩子们\N
	asked that you kiss his children for him.
	- 他还好吧 - 你了解他的 坚如磐石\N
	- He's all right, is he? - You know him. Iron as ever.
	- 那你和他还是朋友了？- 是的\N
	- You and he are still friends, then? - Yes.
	我很快就会去东部 与安东尼作个了断\N
	Very soon I will have to go east to end this thing with Antony.
	我想你跟我一起去\N
	I want you to come with me.
	- 为什么 - 你和乌利纳斯关系很近\N
	- Why? - You are close to Vorenus.
	他和安东尼关系很近 你可以作个调停者\N
	He is close to Antony. It may be you can act as a mediator.
	那我们可能减少不必要的流血牺牲\N
	Maybe we can save unnecessary bloodshed.
	不是要和你争论 但情况似乎不是这样\N
	Not to argue with you, but it doesn't seem likely.
	当然有些是必须要死的 安东尼不能活\N
	There are some will have to die, of course. Antony cannot be saved.
	- 那个男孩恺撒里奥显然也必须去死 - 恺撒里奥？\N
	- The boy Caesarion will have to go, obviously. - Caesarion?
	他们已经公认他为罗马的国王了 波罗\N
	They have named him putative king of Rome, Pullo.
	他必须得死 但是克娄巴特拉以及她和安东尼的孩子\N
	He will have to die but...
	可能会留下\N
	perhaps Cleopatra and her children by Antony may be saved.
	- 为了稳定 - 是的\N
	- Preserve some stability. - Yes.
	我明白了\N
	I see.
	我不想命令你去 波罗 但如果不得不这样的话 我会这么做\N
	I do not want to order you to come, Pullo, but I will if I have to.
	不需要 没问题\N
	No. No problem.
	- 我会去 - 好的\N
	- I'll come. - Good.
	将会像古时候一样\N
	It will be like old times.
	一起历险\N
	An adventure together.
	因此或多或少是安东尼把屋大维拉到战争中去的\N
	So, Antony more or less forced Octavian into war.
	不然的话东部就会陷落于埃及人之手了 我们都不想那样 是吧\N

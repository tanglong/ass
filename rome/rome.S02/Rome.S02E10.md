	I've been fearful of defeat.
	现在我真的败了\N

	那个妖妇和她的 小跟班在那儿避难\N
	where the witch and her creature take refuge.
	显然 战争一开始 克娄巴特拉就吓得躲了起来\N
	Apparently, Cleopatra took fright and fled as soon as the battle started.
	那个胆小的恶棍安东尼 也跳上船追随她而去\N
	And that cowardly villain Antony jumped in a boat and chased after her.
	留下他的兵士 为了他的淫欲而去送死\N
	Left his men to die for the sake of lust.
	安东尼不是懦夫 他们一发现赢不了\N
	Antony's no coward. As soon as they knew they'd lost the battle,

	那该怎么办\N
	What, then?
	这个是给你们的女王的\N

	现在你看我敢不敢杀你\N
	Do not test me now.
	你还有脸\N
	Kiss my arse!
	我没让你开膛破肚算你走运\N

	But I have to get Caesarion out of here.
	- 你说带走是什么意思？ - 他不走 屋大维会杀了他\N

	Doesn't matter what you say.
	他就是恺撒大帝的儿子\N
	He is the son of Caesar.
	不管他是谁 留在这 他就会死\N
	Whoever he is, he stays here, he dies.
	如果没有被你的求生欲望蒙蔽 你一定也能看得出这点\N
	You'd see that if your desire to live hadn't blinded you.
	那你呢 你为什么要救他 他是你什么人\N
	And you, why would you save him? What is he to you?
	他跟我没关系 但他父亲是我的朋友\N
	He's nothing. But his father is my friend.
